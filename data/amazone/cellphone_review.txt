The darn thing broke almost immediately.
When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!
What a flimsy piece of crap.
I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again
I bought this for $30 from Best Buy. What a waste of money!
The ear gels are comfortable at first, but after an hour or so, your ear starts to really hurt from it.
The sound quality is TERRIBLE! People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud, even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300.
What is worse, people I am talking to hear me very poorly. They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar, even when I'm just sitting in my car. People can barely hear me over the background noise racket
Beware!  The "Product Features" for this product specified
a "Call answer and end button on the headset." The device I received did not have that feature.  I selected this model because of the advertised feature.  Amazon.com's description was erroneous and misleading.  I returned the item and was charged for the return shipping.  I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product. They ignored my email.
In the online return process, there's no option that states the return was a result of Amazon.com's fault.  Basically, they falsely advertise so that you buy the product, and when you discover it's not the right one you're screwed.  I now understand all those complaints I've read about Amazon.com.  I'll take the loss this time, but I won't repeat my mistake and order from them again.  Buyer beware!
This review is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon.com's false description of the product. I couldn't use the product so sorry I couldn't give a review about it
I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have
I see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why...
I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.  
The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work.
I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase.
The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch.
To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay
Junk. Junk. Junk.  Mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working
I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.'
Design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor - people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound/ mic is not clear or muffled. Find an alternate hands free- piece
I owned two of these EarBooms. The fit was comfortable and the sound very good. However, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress
I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. However, I constantly get complaints from whoever I'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these
Apparently you need to &quot;know&quot; your technical specs -- Universal does not mean Nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with Nokia, I get the expense of sending it back. This should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site
I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work. 
Yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one.
I purchased a brand new Samsung t809, and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone.  I went to a genuine T-Mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit.  The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit.  Clearly, a manufactuering defect by Samsung.  I contacted Samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that "the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty."  What?!  End result, I get to duct tape my battery in place.  Thanks.  If you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product.  Clearly not Samsung
I got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, I'm pretty disappointed with the phone. This is my first Samsung and, I'm pretty sure, my last one! I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I "betrayed" it. From now I wouldn't get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe Sony-Ericsson.
So here is a short list of those "little things" that make your life, with this phone (and it's combination with T-Mobile), annoying:
- the keys are not comfortable to use.
- it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time.
- putting a comma, while writing a text message, capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot)
- you can't set the camera shutter to be silent...
- you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones...
- you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address.
And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through, like it would've been in a Nokia (even in a model 5 years old!)
Oh yeah, and T-Mobile really "contributed" to the "greatness" of this phone, removing some of the features and limiting others, like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although, there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp
I can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, Samsung could produce this giant POS. It's flashy, yes. But does it deliver?? No. I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. I loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and I even liked the video feature. But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!! It's been years since I've had such lousy reception from a phone. I'm considering taking the dealer to court over this, since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. I want my money back!!
Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for.  Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business
Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone. They are incredibly cheaply made, and when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call. Essentially unusable, unless we find some trick that we have missed so far. We ordered a Sennheiser PC120 to try instead
I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck, but they are complete junk.  They worked, but never well, for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit
I agree with most of the others, it worked okay for a couple of months... now, not only does it not charge my phone, but if I plug it into my phone, it immediately loses all charge!  It's also always falling out of the lighter plug.  I don't have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets
Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr, the phone complains that this an "Unauthorized Charger" and it will not charge the phone. Do not waste your time with this
Does not work with Verizon V3C. When I plug the phone in, it says "Unauthorized Charger" and refuses to charge at all. It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a "charger." I give it one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars. If I could, I would give it ZERO stars. I suppose that would be bad for business, but it is what it is. Avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing. Maybe it works in China, but not in North America
A useless piece of junk.  Worked for 3 minutes then broke.  Have since bought a Motorola-brand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk.  Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag, because you get what you pay for (or what you DONT pay for in this case). 
This razr car charger only worked for about 1 week then quit working.. I would not recommend this vendors products.
The Premium Vehicle Power Charger was not compatible.  I returned i
Motorola one is far better in quality as well to use
The product description should state that it does not work with the Verizon V3C!  When plugged in, it states "Unauthorized Charger" and will not charge at all (although, if the battery is dead, it will give you enough juice to speak, but it still won't charge(?)).  
These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from.  I sent mine back
I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one.  Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking
The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice
Save your money.  The eargels split in two days.  I used regular ear buds on the large size.  They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality.  If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping.  I have no use for them
I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.
I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone
As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone.
While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it.
Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.  
The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets.
I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung.
I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his
I was so excited to get my first "cool" phone. . .I've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr, I knew I wanted one.  I saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.
I have only had this phone for a month, but I am horribly disappointed.  It has horrible reception (and I know it's not the network because I tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls.  It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever.  I went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new Samsung, but I'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations.  :
T-mobile has the worst customer services. Sometimes, It is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. Since I started my plan, I had a problem reciving my bill on time. So, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. Also, when I tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two days,and It costed me an additional $4. Every time I tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. More than once, if I stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer. I had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. Also, the reception is not the best in the country. I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network, and they were getting services in places where I don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money

The product itself would have worked great if they included all the pieces. Only the plug in portion came, no USB cord.  I then requested a cord and WebTreo said they would mail one to me immediately, but none came.  I emailed their customer service again and have received no response.  FYI - it works to charge your iPod too
This case does not work well. The case blocks the camera eye and the clip lasted one week
Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril
Looks nice, protects the i860 very well.  But... I've only had it for 3 months, the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used.  The swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets.  The cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera, it has to be held down away from the lense.  Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers
I never got my order even after a month after I placed it.  They reply to you email with false info.  Always saying its on the way.  One item that i did get was the wrong item.  You have been warned. Be very careful from these guys.
I've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers, but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for.  A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go, and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire.  I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone.  It arrived, however, defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged.  Per the STI Mobile web site, I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone.  This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service.  In the first one, the rep told me that I was mistaken, and must have been sent the wrong charger.  No offer was made to replace the charger, strangely, which was included as part of the package deal.  After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger (I took the phone in to a local merchant, who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective).  At this point, the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone!  This entire process took several weeks.
In short, I guess you get what you pay for.  If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs, but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider
Worthless. It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off. Flimsy and broke within a week. Not even worth the 0.01 I paid for it which is sad. :
Poorly made and weak. Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytime I disconnect it from the holder. Stopped using it within a day after purchase. There are better holsters for the RAZR on the market. Avoid this one
Title says it all.  Phone falls out.  Clip swivels badly.  Just
trash
My Motorola C139 with Net10 crashed on me.  I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone, except they sent me this flip phone (V171).  I liked my candy bar phone and didn't want this flip piece of junk.  I was happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing, and then things quickly went downhill.  Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone, even though I had minutes available on the old phone.  
I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phone, which works awesome with no problems.  She had problems all the time with the V171.  She had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed, even the local numbers.  She also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send.  In my opinion, the V171 is completely worthless.
Overall, I am a very dissatisfied customer.  My recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service.  Go shop Cingular for all the great deals they have
service is terrible, no good ringtones, my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates. Dont get it! You will end up paying the same if you have a plan
I wouldn't recommend this product to any one. The phone cover really sucks. I just used this product for a month....and the clip cover peeled off....really disappointed with this purchase.
I agree on "it was too good to be true" statement for this package.
The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap !. The 
charger melted in the car after a sunny day, I couldn't even test it. Earphone quality is not good as well, giving a constant humming noise. The case is the best out of these three so far. So one out of three for 10 bucks. I am not recommending anyone to buy this item. 
The case and ear bud are fine, but the car charger I was sent doesn't even fit my Nokia 6230. That was the main reason I bought this package.
This deal was too good to be true. Of course I wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least I expected them to all work. I don't know if I got a bad earbud or what, but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used.
The case I didn't need, but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed. The power adapter seems to work fine. So basically I spent $9.99 and am only using the power adapter. I guess that's a good enough deal. I think I'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud/headset though
I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala-500 and used it all about maybe 5 times.  Why such a short amount of time?  Because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in the car with the windows up and radio off.  It's a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on  the other end can hear me.  Now I keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power.  If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere.  The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone.  Think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first.  Even with the rebate I only paid $[...], but still not a bargain.  The one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone
As soon as I bought it I realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. Few days later my concerns proved them selves, every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it, untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me. There goes a $200 phone, lost because of a stupid $10 holster.  Do not buy this product, if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericsson's "ICE-26" that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. As for me I gatta get me a new phone, shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it
The skin is a great idea, but it is not practical.  It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have, so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo.  The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons, so I misfire applications.  The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster.  Do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly
I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement, however I was disappointed.  While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment, after the first day it looks like it's two years old.  If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily.  And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt.  Don't even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket.  Finally, the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover.  If you're in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover, but for the rest of us...keep shopping or buy insurance
The SkinTight cover is cool. Works pretty well with the unit, but the belt clip SUCKS! It's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa.
The headset really has bad sound quality.  I missed the reviews before I ordered & I shouldn't have bought it.  considering the quality of the headset, I didn't even try the car charger in the fear that it wouldn't follow the necessary battery charge cycle
This stuff isn't even worth $14.99.  My husband and my aunt couldn't even hear me.  It's a piece of crap. I sent it back the same day.  DON'T BUY IT!!
PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone
I was with Sprint for almost 10 years, all told. I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. Just recently, without any warning, whatsoever, they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time.  Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever.(I had only backed up about 45 of them.) I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years!!! This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! So, my advice: DON'T TRUST SPRINT!!! Again, this happened with any warning! It could happen to you too! Trust me: avoid Sprint at all costs! I should have
I got this as a gift, its too thin for me. I"m not into the credit card sized phones.  Picture quality sucks, its hard to manage it.  the menu buttons are inconviently placed, such as the My content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling.  its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone!
I bought this item to protect my new Motorola L6. 
First of all, it's a cheap piece of plastic... would break if dropped.
Second, and more important, MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK WITH IT ON! The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone, preventing any usage of the entire phone. 
BEWARE... DON'T BUY
It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily. The shipping was fast and the price was right
I tried to cancel the order, but they said it has been shipped.  I was cancelling on October 13, 2006, but the package labeled that it was shipped on October 17, 2006. How can it be shipped 4 days after it was shipped
You get what you pay for.  Don't bother with this at all.
My car charger did not work at.  See other reviews on the problems w/ the leather case.  Save your money
I haven't tried the hands-free device and probably won't bother, but the case is cheap looking and the charger didn't work at all.  As they say, you get what you pay for!  I'm going to an actual store and get a real Motorola accessory kit.  Don't bother with this one
I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewer's ear...  I figured at this price, I'd try for my wife and I.  When I first tried them on, I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on.  Even with the provided clip, these fall out and you're better off not using them.  Frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones.  Two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive. 
Samsung has a great phone with the Black Jack.  Unfortunately, the headset jack is not a standard jack, but instead one unique to Samsung phones.  Therefore, you are forced to buy Samsung's headset.  Bottom line -- don't bother.  The design is horrible.  The earbuds don't stay in the ear.  What makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord.  Any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear.  I hope that Samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones. 
I think this is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had.  It just doesn't seem like it's Nokia quality to me.  I would get the Samsung slider if I could do it all over again.  Battery life is subpar, slider seems cheap and breakable, speakerphone is not loud enough.  The interface is pretty smooth, but that's about it.  If you have to have a simple interface, then this might work, but otherwise I'd get the Samsung
I got this phone cause I thought it would be a nice little phone. Wrong. Yes it plays songs. Yes it is little. Too little!!!! This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers. The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK! It is hard to use. I returned the phone after only 2 DAYS! I got the Samsung T629. TOTALLY better. Does almost everything the Nokia does, but is better, looks better performs much better. If you are a teenager this phone may be good for you. The Samsung even sounds better. Get the Samsung, same price more phone
It was broken in a few days of use, you should buy a hard cover instea
This headset is NOT compatible with the Nokia E62!  The Nokia E62 has a 2.5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory.
For $4 it's not bad, but within two weeks the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic, looks horrible, but if you don't care how the case looks then this is the case for you
Snaps on easy but snaps off easy too.  It also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do.  This case also hinders comunications, maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line
This thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you don't ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo
I got this for Cyber Monday for $20 too.  I thought I couldn't go wrong for $20.  Well, I was wrong--it was twenty dollars completely wasted.  I'd feel bad giving this POS away...  I could not get the thing to stay put, the boom mike is so bottom-heavy that it won't stay close to my cheek even sitting still!  And it pokes out about 3 feet to the side of my head (it seems like it anyway) if I am moving around at all!  Almost like it was DESIGNED to get as far away from my voice as possible.  But even holding the stupid thing with my hand did not help the sound quality.  I got constant complaints that I could not be heard very well.
There are only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating.  First, I did only pay $20 for it.  Second, it's a decent quality, just piss-poor design.  And three, I liked that when I clicked the button (not due to incoming call), it automatically launched the voice dial menu, so I could really make a call without ever touching my cell phone.  I guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfr for both headset and phone. But it fails miserably at it's primary design goal, so I heartily recommend staying away from this product
Saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece, so I took it.  The installation was a little tricky at first, but once i got it paired with an LG Chocolate, it was functional.  Tested it out all over the house, and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet.  Used it driving, and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels.  Not a quality bluetooth earpiece.  Look to Motorola or Jabra for a decent one
This product alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF. You must still buy other software to use it. When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says "may require 3rd party software for various uses". I just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED. 
I would rate my experience with this seller as: Dissapointing
At least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere. 
I know from experience. I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years. I think one company makes them all. They will NOT last. The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out. For some reason, it only happens with the Palm-type cables. My iPod and USB retractable cables have lasted. Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hot-synching and/or charging daily.
See my PALM page at [...
I bought this cable. My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable, but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place, so WATCH OUT, and treat this cable nicely. I like the retracting cable concept, but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back
This holster offer's your phone ZERO protection.  Not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster.  While it does allow the phone to swivel, thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated, I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead.
Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement.
All in all, I would NOT recommend this holster.  I'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak..
While this is a functional holster, be aware that you may -- like me - find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster.  I know, I know.  You can turn off the "answer phone when opened" option, but that is not preferred by everyone.
You may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely.
I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would be a good company. I have never been treated so rudely by customer service people in my life. In multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twice. It was a nightmare.
I ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money. I feel stolen from.
I would never do business with this company again. Huge mistake in the first place
I'm writing a review for the first time because I've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts. I ordered them on December 5th. It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again
Great concept: protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches.  The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint.  It's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off).  The protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well.  Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if I try and reposition the unit itself).  The plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged.  All in all, I am pretty disappointed... mainly because I paid over $33 for it.  It's now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust
My husband and I found these cases for our new SLVRs and were excited.  Unfortunatly, like others, we have found that they don't fit our phones.  We have the right style SLVR, the case just doesn't fit
I purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr L7.  It doesn't fit.  The case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone.  Don't waste your money.
This phone case is the worse one ever for the TREO 650. Yea the color is great but, if you just tap it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit ease.  The screen protector is not that great either.  A piece of plastic over the screen.... You have to lift it up so now you have a piece of 2 cent plastic over a five hundred dollar phone.  Not smart.  Now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screen to protect it. Quote "It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed)." Well about this statement. Insurance!!! If you invest in a five hundred dollar phone then you must have insurance on it.  So, I guess you are not hosed in the end.  Final:  I am very disappointed in the cover and recommend that you invest in another product (leather).  I bought this item hoping to have something different.  The sale price is really what it is worth.  Six bucks....  $6.00 on a $500.00 phone.... My bad.. I really should have tough about this one and this is a warning to others.  How cheesy... I tough I was getting a deal
I bought three of these at once - and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3.5mm headset for listening to music, but they didn't handle calls at all - everything is full of static, listening and talking. I just placed a call with it, and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible, but it was the adapter that was the problem, full of static and echo. I would never use these for calls
I enjoyed using this phone for some time.  It was functional, it felt solid, and it had a nice low profile look. 
However, after around a year and a half, the continued act of opening and closing the phone has caused the hinge to crack, and to gradually break off completely.  I now have to hold the phone together with my hand while I talk, which is extremely awkward.  This is especially frustrating given the rest of the phone is so well made.  Furthermore, it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my "upgrade" opportunity (in a couple of months), and right after my purchase of some extra accessories (batteries/chargers).  
Search around online for "a670 hinge" and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine.  This in itself wouldn't be a problem if Samsung would willingly replace the phone.  However, they are not claiming it as a design defect, and neither Samsung nor Verizon are offering to replace it.  Bad form for both, although perhaps Verizon isn't as much to blame.
I would avoid both Samsung and this phone because of this incident.  This phone is seemingly designed to be durable, but it frankly is not meant for the long haul, and is too pricey given its average performance. 
Samsung A670 is a lame phone. Also, the battery life is not good. It didn't have many features so its just a waste of your money. The Ringtone Volume was too low. I would suggest Samsung improved this phone. I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again. I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust.
this battery is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670. when you put it in, it reads "bad battery" on the screen and will go no further
I don't know about other company, but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture.  I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3, but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic.  There is no leather on the case at all. Not only that, the cover smells like petroleum oil
This is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of your phone. The outside is a faux leather, made of plastic that looks convincing enough. All told it is an acceptable choice, trendy
This worked for only a couple days. Although the belt/pocket clip held my Treo securely, it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way. After a cople of days, the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time...after a couple more days it was useless.
Save your money on this one..
I've owned a Tracfone for 3 years.  My old Tracfone quit working, so I purchased a new one.  I've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone.  It's been a nightmare-after 4 weeks, 3 new sim cards, and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps, I've accomplished nothing.  My phone is still not activated, I still don't have my old number transfered, and I've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps.  I don't recommend TracFone
Got it home put in the sim card, add the battery and changed the phone. Once it was charged I went to activate the phone, it said "insert sim". I redid several times, called support, got the run around, becaused it did not understand my error. When I got a person, she said the same thing, after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card, the lady said they would have to send me a new phone, mind was broke. So we will see if the new one is better, next week when it comes
We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year.  Very inconsistent service.  When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was "blacklisted".  After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500.  We were told it was "like for like" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand.  If a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!
I got the phone because it was small but I didn't know I'd be sacrificing so much. The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day. I get shoddy service and while i do like the design, there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing. All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies, but it's not really the best for what you'll want to do with your cell phone.
I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards. The phone will say "Insert SIM Card" even if it is inside. It recyles, and when it does so, the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped. There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics, ringtones, and games.  You cannot change the mini display. Save your money because you might end up spending 40-50 bucks on SIM cards, and another 50 for a replacement phone.
My wife and I got two of these phones for "free" when she switched to Cingular. After two weeks, we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly. My phone was fine, but has lately been experiencing the same issues. I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas. Sometimes I'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back.
I do not recommend this phone. Even though it is/was free, it's not worth the frustration
I got this phone in January, and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls.  They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone... but it wasn't.  The one I have now isn't as bad as the first one, but it still loses service and drops calls constantly.  Don't buy this phone
This has to be the worst phone I've ever owned.  I thought Motorola StarTac (my very first phone) was bad, wait till use this phone.  I have 4 LG C1500 phones in my family plan.  2 works ok but the other two, where do I begin.  First, it keeps complaining to insert sim card although it's inserted properly.  Went to Cingular store got the new sim card, works ok for a day.  Next day, same thing.  Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones.  Now one of the two doesn't complain about the sim card but occationally it says it's not in the network although it shows full bars.  The other one still have problem with sim card.  I just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but can't talk more than a minute.  It just drops a call in the middle of conversation.  I now am trying to get a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it.  I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to go, what a nightmare...
We bought 2 phones on a family plan last October.  We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability, no bells and whistles needed.  Our major use was to communicate between each other.  We were happy for for about 5 months.  Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned.  Our phones were replaced during April. One sim card was replaced during June. Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone.  Another replacement phone is on the way to us.  The major problems have included "service not available" even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location, "unable to read", "insert card", and of course dropped calls.  Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call.  At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution.  I can not depend on it.  I would not recommend it to anyone
Good case...functional charger...*headset NOT COMPATIBLE with the Nokia 1100!!!* Completely different connector type...LOOK CLOSELY at the product photo
Totally impractical - this model smartphone is already fairly bulky - this just makes it as lot more so.  Even worse, you cannot attach it to your belt or pocket because there are no clips and /or loops in the design !
The construction is shoddy, very bad quality leather, made in China.
My phone (Cingular 8525) would not even fit in it.
The design itself seemed awkward.
It went straight back to the Boxwave
The USB cable and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone, purchased through Xcingular. The phone will NOT connect to the pc. The phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable. Uninstalled the software and tried again, with firewall shut off. Same result. Connecting a USB device should NOT be this difficult.  
I bought this case to protect the best bar phone on the market, the Sony Ericsson W810I. Within 2 Days the case already started to crack and chip. I dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case. The case also scratches easily too. The only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish, but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon. 
Bottom Line: This case only protects against scratches.I was actually looking at the Clear Silicone Cases
my car adapter lasted for about a week and then it broke and my case riped on the 2 day 
Unless you have a CD with a program that is specific to your phone this cable.
First: The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws.  Second:  No Fixed belt clip.  Third: Only the case is black, all other parts are clear plastic.  Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each, spent 35 dollars on shipping.  Guess i got what i paid for.  Now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund
When I first got this item I was very pleased. It was so cheap and it looked great. It snaps so easily on and feels really cool. However, after about 3 weeks, the duller, not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off. Beneath it was a very shiny black coat. I was so disappointed, I took it off and went with my original cover. It looks really bad and just looks like something I've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks. I am very displeased with this item
I have a UX245.  As you can tell from the item name, this product should have been compatible with my phone.  However, when installing the cd, you are asked to pick your phone from the list.  My phone wasn't even on the list.  Then I got a message saying it woulrd corrupt my computer if I continued to download.  However--who wants to send it back for a refund when you lose shipping and the shipping was as much as the item!!!!!!!
DO NOT order from this company. The cable does not fit in the phone. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity. The cable came a few days late. When it arrived, the cable did not even fit. The software for the cable was defective. After it had finished installing, Windows XP came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system. Eforcity is awful
The only support I received was to send me to a competitor's homepage and try to download their software.
The cable worked. That's about it. The software provided did not work, and it did not include the VX8300 model?! There was no contact information for the manufacturer, and I spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate driver, plus I had to find software to use this thing
USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in (it works now, but has to be held in by hand).  Came with no instructions, and, if you don't have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers, you won't be able to figure this out.  The driver CD is useless more or less, since they don't send you a "product number," which is needed to access the menu on the CD.
It works, and I am able to send files to and from my phone, but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer, and a whole lot of cursing. I won't be ordering anything from them again, and if I had it to do over, I'd order the cable from a different company
I was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own.  The cable itself is O.K. but I had to locate the correct drivers on my own and it's definitely not intuitive, and definitely not plug-and-play.  Support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitor's website to locate the drivers on my own.  Also, (and with no offense intended) if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you
It took a week and half to receive it - 3 days to get confirmation for the order only, and they ship by regular mail;
then there's a single protective screen pre-cut in a plastic, it doesn't cover well the whole screen surface (it's about 1-2 mm narrower) and it's very tough, hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath, I had to take it off immediately, then once removed from place it's a waste
I bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable, i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics, even though it is more its worth it
This cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting.  I do not recomend it.  It costs more to ship it back then it does to replace it.  I will chalk this up to "you get what you pay for"..
The case fit well, but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart. I'm very gentle with my phone, but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one. It no longer stays on so I threw it away. THe bottom is still on great, but it dosn't do me any good without a top!
I ordered a three-piece set of an earpiece, phone cover, and car charger for my Motorola i860 phone. When I get the order, the phone cover, custom supposedly, was too small for my phone. My earpiece worked temporarily, then it started shocking me, now it doesn't work. The only piece, the one I didn't need, that worked was the car charger. I'm very unsatisfied
Net10 cell phones are great, but don't buy this card.  Net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards.  I put the pin # in my phone and did not receive the minutes.  I called technical support and received 1000 minutes.  I was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that I will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days.  DON'T BUY THIS CARD
I put the multi-clip on my belt and the spring metal bent out of shape. I found another clip from another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also. The case is great but the accessories suck. Poorly made with light weight materals. Save your money
This clip came with the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone. The second day that I had the case I lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasn't able to be fixed. I am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner. I would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around at a desk. I don't know if it was just my clip, or if all of them are made poorly.
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back
Excellent high-res LCD, but the rest of the phone was a disappointment. Poor overall interface with configuration options in non-intuitive locations. Particularly disappointing was how it handled WiFi. Each application seemed to want to be tied to a particular wireless source. So, I'd go home and try to get it on the wireless, but I'd have to bring up the app, let it spin a while, be told it couldn't connect, then I'd have to tell it to use the local WiFi. It was just clunky. The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone, and a very expensive an bulky one at that.
I can check and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to get an appication running and connected via WiFi. Much better WiFi management is a must before I'd consider this phone.
This is a serious example of one device trying to do everything, and doing nothing very well. The device is relatively nice, but I gave it two stars because a $500 price tag means it has to deliver. I bought and quickly returned the phone
I wouldn't buy this unless it's an emergency, because it's one of those chargers that reports errors, and makes your phone start beeping non-stop when it's done charging.  I don't want this because I like charging at night, the other chargers don't do this (I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall, like switching off, when the battery is fully charged..so it beeps as if it's being plugged in over and over).
When I first got it, I was trying to carefully plug it into my phone--and I didn't want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger.  It wasn't going in smoothly and it didn't match up or seem to fit inside at ALL.  So I went a day without a phone and I did more research to see why the heck they'd lie that it fit my phone.  Finally I got fed up because I couldn't find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it.
FINALLY it fit!  But I had to shove it in.. who knows if it was damaging my phone.  But it was charging so I was happy (my cell is my only phone.. so I was cut off from the world).  Then I tried getting it out and couldn't figure it out!  I had to jimmy it off, and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secure itself.  I was able to put it back on, and finally learned a routine so to speak, for taking it off, but it's cheap.  It's very cheap.
So, the charger works, but it's very hard to use and it isn't convenient at all.  I don't recommend it unless it's an emergency.  For me, it was
This adapter was supposed to charge ww600i as listed , but it did not even fit it . Its totally false information being given for this item ..will never purpchase it from this merchant ever ..cant belive Amazon has these untrustworthy merchants
I guess you get what you pay for. This charger works, but apparently not quite the way Sony Ericsson would like it to. When using this charger, my SE W300i often reports charging errors. This never happened with the original SE charger (which my dog ate, hence the new one)
A very basic phone with not one good ringtone, display or wallpaper.  Did not recieve the USB cable. I am going back to the Nokia 6102i. 
I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that weren't working.  It was too frustrating.
Can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well. 
There are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual.
--customisation of the front screen is do-able.
--there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  No mention in the user manual.  Stumbled across it.
--Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular.  First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  A double payment.  The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.  
--The volume was always frustrating.  I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  Volume controls are easy.  However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.  
-- I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  You're being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise.  It's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume
I must live on the edge of Cingular's (and everyone  else's) coverage area.  This phone can't hold a call at my house, and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength.  Part of the problem is the coverage area, but part is the phone, too.  I have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem.  If you live like I do in a pothole on the Information Superhighway, avoid this phone. 
I'm on my 3rd v-180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it (under warranty) for another.  Unfortunately, they have the option of sending you a refurbished model, which means that they tried to fix someone else's problem phone and pawn it off on you. This one is going to get flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy, since Cingular says it's now out of warranty and I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months
I had to change 4 phones in one year with cingular. Not worth its mone
I gave this one star because there is not an option for zero stars.
Problems:
General:
        1.  Sim card does not store the full information on each          contact and is therefore useless.
Phone specific:
        1. Sim card failed after less than 1 month and had to be replaced.
        2. Foolish designer attached vibrator module to flat cable connecting base piece to hinged piece.  The vibration causes the cable to delaminate and soon the vibrate doesnt work and eventually the screens fail and you have to order replacement phone.  
        3. Less contact fuctionality of any of my previous phones ie. multiple number entries.
        4. One of my 3 phones (in a 8 month span) failed after a fall of 10" onto the floor. Yes 10" ... less than a foot.
        5. I have to disassemble the phone and clean the microphone every month or so or no one can hear me talking.
       
We were excited to find such a good deal. The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse. The home charger never worked. The car charger works, so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package. One thing my boyfriend and I learned through this experience, is to pay for known quality and performance, in the long run you save money, hassle and time
For a good price of approximate $4.50 (as I recall) plus shipping, I ordered the Bargaincell- Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter.   It did not work.   I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back (at a cost to me) and probably received a replacement. But for the cost of the unit, it was not worth my time. I've resorted to using a standard car recharger
I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesn't work with it. Strongly I don't recommend this others.
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! It is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer, I wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer.  NO WAY!
the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it.  I have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work.  I dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is.  The disk has 40+ files on it, I dont know if one of the other drivers would work, but I am very frustrated
I bought this battery to replace the original one that came with my cell phone.  The "new" one holds a charge a shorter time than the old one does!  I have to charge it every day, whether I use it or not.  I feel ripped off, to tell you the truth
I only buy it because I must to have a battery backup for long trips and I can't wait for the seidios battery
Well the only good thing one can say about the Treo 680 battery is that it's thinner. The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day. As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 4-5 hours under business use, the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are: deplorable, distressing, lamentable, unsatisfactory and unsuitable. 
I'm really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy battery with the Treo 680. But happily, there is a quick fix, buy 1-2 more batteries and keep them charged and don't leave home without them ;-
Unlike the other review, I can not recommend this at all.  The GPS regularly takes at least 10 minutes to find satellites (sometime longer), the Palm needs to be resynced (bluetooth) with the GPS at least once a month.  When it does work, its great though
I purchased this to replace a lost holster.  The first time I tried to place the 7290 in the case, it split at the seams
The battery was not accepted by my motoraola phone.  It was a "pirate" product and worthless.  Unfortunately, I discovered it after the expiration of the Amazon return date
I bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge (after sitting in a closet for a year). I was thrilled to get a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again. I opened it up, put it in my phone, tried to close the battery cover and it would not close. Not even close. If I forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latch, but it was actually bending the plastic of the phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment.
The battery is about 50% thicker than the standard battery for a Motorola v60. Might be great for the extra battery life, but bad if you can't get get the battery cover on your phone. I give it two stars because the battery may work fine for all I know, but it won't fit in a v60
The case looks horizonal... but a belt clip is placed vertically making it obtursive and cumbersom
Although it's listed under the accessories section for the V66, it is NOT for the V66.  Well, I guess it will work with just the phone, but not the extra battery.  No sense in having this if it doesn't charge the second battery.  I checked it out on the Motorola site, and in fact, it is the wrong one.  This charger is the Motorola SPN5029, which doesn't work with the V66 and 2nd battery.  The correct number is the SPN4970
Hi,
Before buying this phone from Amazon, I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new. I subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and I am using it on the T-Mobile network.
I now have a problem on the display within 2 months of purchase. I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech support, they asked me to read out my serial number. It starts with a HAGA which, they indicate, means that it has to be on the AT&T Wireless Network. According to them, I am in violation of the warranty since I am using it on the T-Mobile network. How am I know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my purchase? If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone, obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network.
Palm is taking the easy way out - they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon. Amazon, itself, does not provide any warranty.
If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions - please let me know.
Thank
The price is high considering that there are newer models.
This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working. When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then I called T-mobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset. Still didn't work. I called back on satuday 02/04/2006, Palm told me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or pay $25 to get a "premium exchange option" and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day. I called back on the following Wednesday palm said to wait untill Friday.Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday. I asked to be refunded my $25 because they lied on the terms, the operator said that she could not
Guys,
Do not take this sheet piece for GOD sake. I am repenting on it :( please take my advice. Thanks
I purchased a Treo 600 when it first came out. That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650. I was on Cingular with both phones. Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had. I'll spare you the details since they've been documented well elsewhere. I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me, I decided to cancel my service with Cingular, which renders my locked phone a $400 paperweight. I've gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS. Palm was a good company once, now they have got their heads up their #&(&^$#(. Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now???
I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years. IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited.  The device can be used for phone calls, calendars, web browsing, email, IM (ICQ, AOL, etc .. ),  internet radio stations, document editing, games, modem for the laptop... and that is just the beginning.
So why only two stars?? and why poor execution?  Very poor voice call quality, reported by many and totally unacceptable!!!  Luckily for me and some others; one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution -- open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil.  It worked, but it should never had to be necessary.
Also screens are week.  Drop on the hard service will break it.  Luckily for
I bought this for my LG Mint Chocolate VX8500.  When you go to install the driver, you're supposed to select your phone from the list.  Well, it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete, and my phone wasn't on there, which probably means that yours won't be either.  Don't waste your time on this cable and just buy the music essentials kit that is actually made for this phone
The product arrived fine and on time from AccessoryOne.  But the cable would not stay connected in the USB port on my computer.  I had to hold it just right for the cable to stay connected.  I threw this cable away and wound up buying Verizon's Music Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600.  The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver that work fine
I took a chance and it didnt work for me.  I have a LG VX-8600. Had to return the product...good luck to you
Thanks God that the phone can survive a moderate fall.  The case pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case, its all loose after that.  Another disappointment, the circular 'knob' that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing, again you guessed it, falls. 
Advantages:
1) Superior protection: I have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case.
2) All buttons accessible, though a bit difficult to get to in cases.
Disadvantages:
1) Signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case!  
2) Belt clip useless, since the case can easily open, spilling out the phone when on one's belt.  
3) Side "ok" button difficult to press, same with top two front front buttons (above "start" and "ok" buttons).
Summary: 
Usable only for protection during transportation, and does this well.
Phone should be removed from case during usage
When I recieved this item, I had mixed emotions for the product. On one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. Also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard.
However, due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials, the case is very thick and bulky - when using the belt clip, the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip, but leans at an angle.
BUT, the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 (which at such a steep price, is not something I like to drop). The problem lies with the snap-shut system that closes the case. Because the metal is so thin, it does not secure very well, and can come open pretty easily. To fix this, I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone, so that it was much harder to both open and close the case. This, for the most part, solves the problem, but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order.
My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case. This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages. This is the only reason I did not give it a one-star rating. 
I am currently looking for a soft case, preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip, rather than bother with a clip anymore.
As a final warning - BE CAREFUL if you buy this case. Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
Let me count the ways this thing let me down:
1. You have to open it to slide out the full keyboard, making it vulnerable to damage
2. It doesn't matter whether you open the case or not. If it drops, the case falls right open anyway, spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protect the 8525 from.
3. The case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it.
4. The case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something, and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged (at least that's what happened to me).
Super disappointed in this product, in case you couldn't tell
Same comments on the latch opening easily. 
My complaint about the belt clip - it is made of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use. Wouldn't buy again
Please please dont buy this just by seeing the photos.It looks nice and great but practically this is a piece of junk
1.it makes buttons more deep down there by making inaccessible.
2.The stylus grove is not good there by making stylus to project out and it will slip
3.the flip is improper.I mean who on earth would do such a lousy design.It opened and my fone hit the ground thrice and i cingular does'nt insure this instrument.
4.The screw.one of the worst part.It cannot sustain the weight of the total phone with the case.why the hell is screw for?
6.Once i hook up this fone to the belt i don't want that my fone would twist and turn 
7.and the worst of all,when the flip faces downwards,which happens by twist and turns,the flip opens and cell fone hits ground wowowwww such a nice design to a piece of junk and hats off to the lousy designer and I hate my self for buying this
if you love yourself dont buy thi
The latch is pitiful.  The phone fits nicely but that latch is NOT secure.  With in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customer's house.  Tons of fun watching your $500 PDA hit the ground and the battery come flying out.
Phone is ok but the case is getting replaced ASAP!!
DO NOT GET THIS CASE!
Originally, I purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525.  However, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up.  Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but I have several big dents and scratches on the case.  I'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up.
The latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use, especially since you'll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen.  Also, it took a bit getting used to, to have to open the case to make a phone call.
The overall quality of this case is very good tho, because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons.
I guess its a great case if you don't wear it on your belt.  But I can't justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket.
I dropped my Treo enough times to break it, and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case
I have a LG VX5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with, was a no go. Product would not install from enclosed CD; computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosed USD cord. A loss of time and money. I have since ordered, received and installed from another product - Data Point from another vendor
Maybe it's because this product is not approved for windows, but I couldn't get it to install
Yes, the cable fits, but the CD driver is just for the 8300. I was not able to get it working
The cover doesn't fit snug with the phone, the stitching broke after two weeks, and the release button is triggered from the bottom.  it also falls off from the clip.
Today it fell off in a parking lot, when i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car.
This is a poor quality product and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
I've had a silicone case on my Treo 650 for a long time.  It was thin and the rubber was very grippy (great anti-slip)- once I left my Treo on top of my car (NOT recommended) and drove 10 miles, and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived!    After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it.   The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original case, so much so that it's difficult to use the 5-way navigator without it doing what I didn't want it to do.  The case is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat, unlike the original.  Boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive- since this isn't, I probably won't bother. But in my opinion, there's better products out there
These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia. With that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped. The software being aftermarket too, has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone. Despite what the descriptions say, this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time
I ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life.  After about 1-2 months of use, the thing shorted out and wouldn't work any more.  I decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured I'd give it another chance...  the thing didn't even work out of the box this time.  
I only wish I could give it Zero stars...  spend the money on a Motorola brand charger instead. 
When I started charging my K750i, it didnt charge at all no matter what. This is a load of s***. dont buy i
I bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a (this model is listed in the description).  First off, the CD that comes with the data cable does not have my phone model on it, making it useless.  I figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from Sony Ericsson's website.  After downloading the software and following the instructions to a TEE, I was still unable to link up my computer with my phone.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case I made an error.  All told, this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with Amazon
Chargers work great and are a great bargain.  However, the generic "LG" driver software that comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesn't have an authenticity signature.  I don't know about other computers, but mine with Windows XP (SP2) won't accept it
Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that Motorola's hardware was very good, but that their software left a lot to be desired.  Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan.  I had made the decision to switch to T-mobile and this looked like one of the best phone options.  Right off the bat I found out that the people who criticized Moto's software were right on the money.  There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone, not the least of which is the -- frankly -- idiotic way the phone book is designed.  Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone.  
As time went by I started noticing that I was missing a lot of calls.  The phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before.  During the course of the last few months (the phone is less than a year old) I've also found that it has begun crashing.  A lot.  Opening or closing it will result in a "white screen of death."  Putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging, that it is unable to charge and that it's SIM card cannot be found, after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off.  With a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off.  
At this point I am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece of junk.  I am also forced to conclude that it isn't the only model which is.  None of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a Motorola phone.  My wife's Motorola has shown its own host of problems.  People working for T-mobile at several stores I have visited have confided that they never, ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone.  In fact I've had T-mobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them, but rather to shop for an unlocked Nokia online.  So that's what I'm going to do.  
Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every night, restart it five or six times a day, and keep apologizing to my friends, family and employers for always missing their calls
The sound is low, static-ky, and it frequently dropped calls. Boo.
I got the HS805 to call home while trucking. I was sold on the AAA battery power source, because the rechargeable ones won't last on a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlet to recharge.
However, I have to say the audio output when adjusted to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler at highway speeds. The wind and engine noise is much higher than in a car and similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft. For this reason alone, this headset is JUNK. 
The advertisements criminally overstate the talk and standby time as well. With a regular new Duracell AAA battery, I get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby. And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable battery I get only 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone. 
As for the marketing department at Motorolla, I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated function and durability. I hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people. Hint: Get a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecing society. You should be proud!
Don't waste your money. After 18+ months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life. Instead of updating to a newer phone, accompanied by a new 2-year service agreement, I opted to purchase a "new" battery. Waste of money! The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must re-charge nightly. That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery - nightly re-charge.
This battery was no better then the old battery it replaced.  When phone was new, battery life was good. Not sure what is the problem.  Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use. Vendor service was good. Or maybe just a bad battery.
The headphone has a standard 8mm plug and won't work with the Katana. The case is absolutely worthless. Don't waste your money on this product
The software that comes with this is not the right software for the VX8500
Havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it. Not too sure how it works...its not showing my phone on any of the software programs (after i hook it up using the USB cable)
the nokia bl-4c battery i got is a counterfeit with fake number 0406040703000042032
I was extremly disappointed when I received this. It did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can. I had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit. When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip... that didn't fit either. I would no recommend this product to anyone, even if it does cost a dollar... with shipping cost it costs about $6.00
the case broke the very next day that i got it
You will still need to buy the AC cord for this unit.  This is not a charger.  It's essentially a $30.00 piece of plastic that holds the Q upright. 
i bought this product about a month or two ago. and i still haven't been able to figure out how to use it. i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use. THis product seems  to be a lot harder unless it's the wrong data cable which it shouldn't be since it's advertised as an EnV data cable
The first problem I encountered with this came right after I took it out of the box.
Both connectors were covered by labels, which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pull them off.  I spent about an hour just trying to get them clean enough to use.
Second problem came when I popped in the "software" disc.  It turned out to be nothing more than a readme file linking me to drivers that didn't even work.  I spent another 20-30 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked.
The cable itself worked fine after I managed to clean the connectors off, find the appropriate drivers, and download Windows Media Player.  Be aware, if you have a Chocolate with V5 firmware, you won't be able to use programs like BitPim with this cable
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!! I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON ALL CORNERS.......
I received this item and the blue illuminated cap is not present on this item.  There is a less expensive product in the marketplace w/ a mere blue LED that looks similar, and that product costs about $10 less @ Best Buy.  While certainly this product works satisfactorily and the price is decent, you should realize that what you're going to get is not what is pictured... unless Eforcity fixes things, that is
Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline.  Shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month??  They refuse to refund or replace.  They are a shady company and I'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same
I've had car chargers before, for other cell phones, and never experienced any problems. I was attracted to this one by the low cost, but I guess you get what you pay for. It lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether.
The charger I got did not fit the Motorola V188, wrong connecter. I was offered a full refund
This product is not what its cracked up be, if looking for a screen protector, look elsewhere.  I can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad.  Waste of $10 and customer service won't respond to my email, matter of fact, email to customer service didn't ever deliver
The product broke the first day I used it. I'm going to have to be more careful. I think they are all cheep.
Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned
This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen. I attempted 4 times, washing the back thoroughly between each attempt, cleaning the Cingular screen with a new lens cloth. Once specks of dust touch the adhesive they're there for good and the protector is ruined. I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid! Save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in.
I have had to exchange my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times!!!!!!  Luckily I purchased the insurance....  I'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr (this last phone only lasted a few weeks!)... This time I am asking for different phone.  The phone works fine then all of sudden one day, 1/2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the "#" is on the screen and you can't get to anything.... No phone numbers, no voicemail, no text messages, nothing!!!! It is extremely frustrating.  What is the point of a cute phone that doesn't work
i hate this phone.  i moved to miami and cannot get reception anywhere. it  cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk.  i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment, so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates.  but here's the thing:  other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem!  they actually get a couple bars of reception, whereas i always have one or none at all.  i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it... with all the same problems.  i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month.  i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price.  on top of that, people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous.  unless you never talk on it, the battery wears out in a hurry.  and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking.  i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident.  i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils.. chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one, or wasting money on a land line.  whatever you do, don't get suckered in by it's cute pink color, because underneath it's pretty exterior it's junk
I'm not a huge fan of this phone.  I got it because I needed a new phone, it was only 40 bucks and, it's pink.  
1.  The battery life on this phone is TERRIBLE.  T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.  Yesterday, after charging the phone the ENTIRE night, took it off the charger about 8am for work.  I made a 5 minute phone call, a 6 minute phone call, entered a number into my contacts, entered an event into my calendar, received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping "low battery"!!!!!
2. The ringtones are SOOOOOOO crappy.  Remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago?  That's what is here.
3. The date and time don't continuously display on the outside screen.  I don't have a clock in my office (I have a very small office and work for a non-profit) and I don't wear a watch, I'm constantly opening my phone to see the time, it's ridiculous.
4.  The battery life is TERRIBLE.
The good thing about this phone so far:
Great reception.  I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am able to speak to them before the battery goes dead.  
If you want a cute-sy phone and you speak for less than 10 minutes a day, this is a great phone.  Otherwise get something else
After my Nextel phone started acting up, I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr style and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the "In" calling was a bonus. I have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860. You can import only a couple of MP3s before the phones memory is full, unless you buy their $50 transflash card (1 gig is the largest). Then, you cannot assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either, a major disappointment for me - again missing my i860 with its 400+ ringtones that I imported from random WAV, midi and MP3 files. You cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events (you have to set a reminder for all, there is no option for no reminder). All in all, not what I grew accustomed to with my i860.  I'm already thinking the $175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the life of my 2-year contract. And that leads me to another rip-off with Verizon, they charge you an extra $35 to sign only a one-year term! Next time I'll read the fine print, and just upgrade my Nextel
well im 16 [writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account] and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink, but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it. first off, it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen, and that takes forever, the phone in general is slow. also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece. Im stuck with this phone for a while, and am not to happy with it
I am terribly disappointed with my RAZR V3c phone.  I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY positive features.  The viewing screen is so small that I can't even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size.   The battery dies about three hours after being charged even if I haven't used the phone.  It does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has Verizon service.  I am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and I can't find any way change this.  I wish I had my old Sprint phone again.
Holds the phone well for a few months untils the clips on the side loosen and break.  After that happens, the phone falls out pretty easily. (and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working)  I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a magnetic clasp.  (The replcement works great
This is a very basic holster, and often simple is best - but not this time. The good news: the 8700 slips right in and out with ease, the swivel works great, and the clip is reasonably secure. A minor issue, becuase its plastic, when the virbrate "ring" is active, it makes an annoying rattle sound. 
The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs (one on each side). Everyday use must weaken the plastic, becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case, which meant that they 8700 would not stay put. It slipped out and fell to the floor several times. I replaced the case, and a month later, the tabs on the new case broke too. 
Due to cheap build quality, I'd suggest you look at third-party case options instead of this one. 
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic. The reason I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call. I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better
I have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months.  It used to be only $6 each so it didnt matter too much (Nextel sells theirs for usually $15-$20).  This is a cheap knockoff.  But if you are looking for a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replace them, feel free to buy this item.  Now that they have raised the price to $10, I'll probably not buy this anymore and get the better one at Nextel
ahhh I see your battery is dying.  Be forewarned.  I'm betting this doesn't fix the problem.  I mean really how old is your phone?  Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired.  The Li-ion batteries usually last around 18 months (hence at 18mon a bunch of i-pod users are gonna get pissy when the i-pod doesn't work anymore and you can't change the battery.)
why hasn't yours lasted that long... oh because your phone sucks.  you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 hr on standby at first and then drop down to 4 hr on standby.
Why?  have you noticed yet how hot that phone is running?  it is cooking its internal electronics, your ear, and the battery.
when you get a new phone - the new one will only have a 90day warranty.  T-mobile will charge you for shipping.  you will spend at least an hour with them on the phone.
aren't these costs adding up for you yet
I have to return this.  Order Motorola, not some off-name brand.  It doen not fit the phone it says it fits
Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users, this belt clip does not fit the phone.  The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove.  Do not bother with it.  This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola phone, but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530
i got this items for my palm tx.  it ncame in the same week that i order it. that was great!  plug it in, it didn't fit so wigle it in. windup pushing the tip in. i manage to pull the out the tip.  i tryed again this time i grip the base tightly, the base split in two. one more time, this time the coper piece got smashed.  i straighten out the coper. plug it in it work, bearly. i threw it away.  
k.
p.s.  not good purchaged, don't bu
I ordered a PC case that came in a box 1000 times larger then what this was shipped in for 10 dollar shipping but I ordered 5 of these for myself and co workers and shipping was 22 dollars.
Never agai
I purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone.  My old battery would not hold a charge anymore, so I wanted a new one.  The new one proved to be just as bad.  I don't think it's a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead.  Would not recommend ordering this if you're looking to replace an old one
I ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters. I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind, not at all like the ones shown. The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pay to send them back. I never got an e-mail about the substituation or response to my calls or e-mail to the company. I will not buy any thing else from them
the other reviewer couldn't run much power through his splitter, but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers, etc.
I wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger, so I thought great.
I can't get any power through mine at all. The little light goes on, but the radar detector doesn't go and the cell phone charger doesn't go. 
I'll probably take it apart andd see if I can rewire it. It isn't worth shipping back.
I really can't recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer
There's nothing &quot;universal&quot; about this product.  It'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones, but don't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter.  I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second.  Sadly, I'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself, and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop.  The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps, which seemed reasonable, so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most, so not only is this busted, but they lie on the package.  I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse, and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one of the springs inside couldn't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it.  I give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously.  For anything else, beware
I have had three of these during my two year contract, I am trying to baby the last one enough until the end of the two years.  Each has had the problem of powering down and re-booting without warning.  The are billed as "Mil-spec" this or that, but unless you keep it inside a purse, get ready for many trips to the Sprint store.  Motorola used to be THE name in communications, but after this and my friend's problems with the Razr's, I'm headed to Nokia
My office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract.  No person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance.  Battery life is terrible out of the box, the interface is clunky, and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance.  If everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you-- it will give you SOMETHING to complain about.  For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your Nextel/Sprint network contract
I have a business acount with 8 lines.Three of my phones are the i530s. I have had nothing but problems with these phones. I have had one repaired three times. Each time I went to repair it I had to be  on a  waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model. I would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later. Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging. I keep spending the $35 charge for swapping them. And nextel customer service is a joke. They will not admit these phones are pieces of crap. When I call I wait for an eternity througha  million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them.
Stay away from this phone.  The 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired. Picking up my last i530. If this one goes, Im canceling my Nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier. I've had it! Nextel and Motorola can't figure out that this phone is JUNK
My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message "network not available". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.
My wife and I both got this phone at the same time.  I chose it because it claims to be rugged, and the price was right.  Well, we have had them for around six months, and they are both not working right.  My wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case, so her i560 now wears pink.  Shortly after, it started resetting itself randomly.  She would pick it up, just to find that she needed to enter the SIM password.  Over time it started doing it more and more.  At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change, but later my phone started doing the same thing.  Now, my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day.  I absolutely cannot believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect.  Anybody can ship one bad product, but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable.  Shame on Motorola
I purchased 2 i560 phones - one for me and one for my husband.  Brand new out of the box, 1 of them had a bad microphone (you could hear the person talking, but they couldn't hear you).  Nextel & Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days - but I raised a stink and finally got it replaced (since it was broke from day 1, I didn't want a "serviced" phone).
Here we are 3 months later, 1 of the phones has a bad microphone - AGAIN, and the other phone's keypad just went bad.  We don't mistreat these phones at all - in fact, we hardly ever use them!  
Motorolla & Nextel's warranty is also worthless - we have to pay to ship our phone's to Motorolla, and we don't get them back for 15 days!
I am stuck with a 2 year contract with Nextel, the service has been horrible, and the i560 phones are lemons & junk!  I would NEVER buy a i560 phone again, or use NEXTEL - their service is terrible!  
And yes, many times the person on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking (aka - drunk)
I bought this phone at the same time I bought the i870. I've dropped my i870 a couple of times and it's fine. My husband dropped the "rugged" phone once and the antenna, which sticks out like a thumb, snapped off. 
Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan, regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards. What army? DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! (unless of course, you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months
Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530, which I loved. I was at the end of a 2 year contract, and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons.  Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well. I would have purchased one of those, except I didn't really care about a camera for my phone, and this one was reasonably priced...and I found out you get what you pay for!  The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750, i870 and even my old i530.  I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - I could hear them, but they couldn't hear me.  
A couple of times, I had the screen go to Airplane Mode, even when I hadn't touched it.  The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside, too.  My previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling, but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it.  Not a great design for this holster. Another problem is with the power supply. When charging the phone, it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly. 
Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working.  Living in California apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee.  Fortunately, we were on day 12, and after 54 minutes, one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents, I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order.  
Terrible, terrible phone.  Stay away from it.  Hoping the new one on it's way works much better!

I got this phone as part of a buy-one-get one free promotion. I changed from Cingular because I couldn't stand my bill being constantly wrong. The i560 seemed like a good choice at first. However, it is not as resilient as advertised. Within the first two months, my phone already malfunctioned. While talking to my wife on the phone, the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen. Next, all I could hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key. I was not even touching the phone. The phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off. Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phone, the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode. This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether. My wife's phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone. Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired. 
Caveat Emptor!
I was seconds away from ordering this charger for my Mother's V170.  THANKS for the reviews - you have saved me time, money & frustration for letting me know - it won't work
I would have thought that amazon would have fix the problem that it did not fit v170. I ordered and guess what, it did not fit. I am returning it
6/6/0
I bought my wife a brand-new v170 for her birthday.  She wanted an extra charger to take to work so I bought this one.  Big mistake!  It simply would not fit in the charger jack.  So basically, it's a worthless piece of plastic.  Last night when my wife was cleaning the counter, she threw it in the trash, brand-new box and all.  At $7.99 it wasn't even worth the trouble to try to return it.  Don't make the same mistake I did
I saw the other review that said it didn't work for V173, but I bought this anyway for my V170.  It also doesn't work for V170.  Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me.  I guess sometimes the products are mislabeled. 
The jack doesn't fit in the hole of the phone on the Motorola V173. Don't know about V170/
First the pros: clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screen, protecting them from wear. Fit is tight so the case takes up little additional space in my pocket.
Now cons: dirt and debris easily finds its way between the plastic and the phone. this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone. The plastic screen also attracts dust. When I tried to remove the phone for cleaning, the side of the case ripped.
All in all, I would not have bought this product again. Please avoid
I wanted to give it only one star but maybe it's a little better than the original...but I can't really tell much difference.  It still goes down by the end of the day and I don't like the bulge. Oh well, it's only $15. It was worth a chance...
My equipment is a Nokia 6225, I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional (SP4) and Windows XP Pro and both don't works . They don't know the device, and with the PC Suite of Nokia it is not connected either.
Who can help me ?
Thanks
I assumed that I would get a DKU-5, which is supposed to work according to the Nokia site.   However, I got a DKU-2, which does indeed connect to my phone (6016i) but is recognized by neither Win XP nor Linux.
I'm bummed...  The part number should have been properly displayed somewhere.  The packaging indicates that it is in fact Nokia part
If you are buying this to connect to a Nokia phone beware.  It is a non-Nokia part and will no easily interface with the Nokia software.  It uses a different chipset than the Nokia data interface cable, which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers.  You may be able to get it working, but I have spent about four hours and have not met with success.  I installed the drivers provided.  I installed Nokia's drivers.  I even installed the PL-2303 serial driver, but I could not make it work.  
Also note that this cable is a serial interface.  If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial port, so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed.
I would recommend against this purchase.  Spend the extra money and buy the real thing.  You'll save yourself some head aches and heart aches.
God bless you
The cord does connect to my phone but the computer does not register the phone. This cord is pure crap
Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer.
I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650, and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680. I have been a faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997, and for the first time, I am disappointed. Of course, I still have the friendly Palm OS, tailor made for smart phones. I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15,000 records stored in the Treo's four main applications. But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations, and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands (contrary to the 650, buttons are too close to each other). Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired, especially compared with the 650 after firmware update. Finally, I use Intellisync for dual sync with both user-friendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook; the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo: Intellisync new version added a record number in the "note" field of all my records ! I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with  MS Office 2007 compatibility... Nokia's low blow to Palm ? It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own. If not, it's decided: I will switch to the Pearl
The good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the Treo 650's interface that were clunky, and it seems to crash less, but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience -- so much so, that I wish I had never "upgraded" to the 680.
I 'upgraded' to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems (don't all Treo 650's suffer from that within a year's usage?) and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems. I loved my Treo 650 anyway so I expected something equivalent to the 650 but what I got was a 'smartphone' with quite a stupid battery life.  I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design (some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card) that is causing power to run right out of the phone, in a sharp decline, even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled. Add to this the fact that Palm's website's online user group is not active right now (so no users can visibly discuss this among themselves),and you don't have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward, when they recently dumped this cheaper "smartphone" on the market recently.  Palm, all I can say is pretty "stupid" and wonder if this was your last hurrah before exiting the "smartphone" market? 
I've used the Palm OS going on 10 years now.  When my Treo 270 died, I bought a used 270 on Ebay.  Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon.  
I called Palm "tech support" on issues I had with it (dial up networking didn't work on internal browser with T-Mobile).  Forgive me for saying it, but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be.  I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another (he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time- did he think I was lying to him?).   He knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor, constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time.  After a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650.
I then tried the T-Mobile MDA.  I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try.  For me it was a huge mistake-  Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive.  They expect you to study how to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface.  Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use, but c'mon- when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning- I don't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly.
Finally, I give up on Pocket PC (sold it on Ebay) and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out.  The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 (as compared to the 650) and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm.  Overall, it's a decent phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC.  Palm customer support is still useless and, as others have mentioned, the lack of a standard Mini-USB connector is simply inexcusable.  Still, I'm much happier with Palm-OS over Pocket PC.
As I use it, I see that the battery doesn't seem to last very long (just over 2 hours of talktime at the most).  I hesitantly call Palm support and get some flunkie again-  I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their "support".  I'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged.  I hate the idea of making such a compromise, but for me it's the lesser of two evils.  The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset.  They just don't care.   As clunky as my Windows MDA was, its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me (even though the MDA has a much bigger screen).
IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains-  The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people, when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo.  Most of the better designed smartphones on the market (Samsung, Motorola, HTC Wizard) are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market.  I just wish other manufacturers offered Palm-OS based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of Palm, without having to be limited to Palm's poorly designed hardware.
....maybe it's time I finally give the Blackberry a try.... :
I love the way the phone looks and feels but that's about it.  From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone I've ever owned.  I've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise. 
First, let me say that I really wanted to like this device. I had patience and understanding for a while but it got me nowhere.
The main issue with this phone is its operating system: Windows Mobile 5.0.
This OS is a piece of fluff garbage. Simple things that should take a click or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just give up.
Main Gripes
-----------
Connectivity with T-Mobile is horrible: accessing the aim function doesn't work 9 times out of 10. E-mail functions are useless. I tried finding a solution for hours and the best I got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that. Internet explorer can NEVER find the page that I'm looking for and consistently tells me to try again. Even when connected to wi-fi this happens. Let me tell you also that this device does not let you choose between wi-fi and edge. If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE then it will continue to use EDGE unless you restart the phone with wi-fi enabled.
Calls
-----
Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smash the phone on a daily basis. Usually, I would press talk to dial a call and it would immediately say "Call Ended." It's as if the device doesn't even want to try.
Also, when answering a call, well trying to answer a call, it would drop it as soon as I pressed talk. What the HELL is THAT!? What good is a phone if you can't make or receive calls? Keep in mind this happens around half the time. Also keep in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY! My calls should not be dropping except for when I'm in the subway. The side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation. Not only that, but when you disable it, you have no other method of changing the volume on the device. ARGGGHHH!
Keyboard
-------
While the keyboard is basically easy to type on, the phone is buggy. First off, the t9 sucks! It will completely change the word you are typing to a word that's in its dictionary while you're typing! EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Now get this, you can't even permanently keep the t9 off. So you have to keep going into the menu to change it to normal ABC mode. While I appreciate the ability to have faster typing, isn't the whole point of a QWERTY being able to type without using t9? When you actually get to typing, sometimes, the keys will "stick" and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it. This isn't a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue.
Programs
-------
For all you techno oriented people out there (basically everyone buying this phone), the programs this device has available for download are minuscule. Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a JAVA program (which most programs are coded in) the Dash's JAVA program will not allow you to open those programs. I ALWAYS get an error stating "A Java midlet is not responding" It then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app. Neither of which solve anything.
This phone is so useless it's beyond words. I could go on and on about it's issues but I really don't care to.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE!
While T-mobile customer support is very helpful and friendly, their service/coverage is non-existent. Calls are constantly dropped, I get voice mails without the phone even ringing, and internet connectivity is never really available.
Please, do yourself a favor and wait for the iPhone.
In summary, Microsoft's software and T-Mobile's service have ruined a brilliant design (although with a couple of flaws) from HTC.
There are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to.  I will break it down to Hardware, Software and Cell Phone Service Provider.
Hardware Pro's:
A lot has been written about this aspect of the device, so I'll keep this to a minimum - The best form factor I've ever seen.  This device provides you the power of a Blackberry without the bulky hardware so I can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster.
- A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and quad-band connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset, cruise web pages and have access to email when in the US or Europe.
- The phone quality is excellent.
- The keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails.
- The battery life is great when Wi-Fi is not enabled and adequate when it is. (I've rarely struggled with a dying battery.)  Stand-by power management appears to be excellent.
- Charging of the device is very quick.
- The display, while a little small, is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size.
- The camera is pretty good and it's been really great emailing photo's to people as I'm traveling around.
[After all of the cons that you'll read below you'll wonder why I ever bought the device and why I still use it.  Well here it is:
1. T-Mobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device.
2. It has great hardware that I can use in the US and Europe, I'm just hoping that Microsoft will finally get it right. ]
Hardware Con's
- The touch sensitive volume button is the most ill-conceived feature I've ever seen.  Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level.  Even worse, when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control and randomly change the volume.
- The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device.  However, the blame could well be laid at Microsoft's door for writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications.  Either way, performance is very slow for some basic functions (see below) and I'm afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor.
Software Pro's
- Not many that really come to mind.
Software Con's 
(I hope you're sitting comfortably)
- When a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and which call to put on hold or drop/ignore.  On the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is dropped/kept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed.  The other call is dropped and not put on hold.
- When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked, if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped.  This is extremely counter intuitive.  If the user presses anything other than the "answer" key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I have depressed the "answer" key.
- The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used.  Even worse, upon selection, the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open.  Now, I have what some would call a large database of contacts, but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash.  It's simply a poorly architected database.
- The user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary (as are all dialog windows on this device.)
- One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock.  The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness.  The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged. First of all, the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off.  From the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm....if only it were that obvious.  The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example: I set the alarm for 6am; the next day the alarm goes off at 6am.  That day I set the alarm for 7am - the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am.  The next day I set the alarm for 7:30am and you guessed it, the alarm now goes off three times.  The best that I've been able to deduce (of course, this type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device) is that the user has to actively select "off" for the current setting before setting "on" for the new time.  But there is no indication of what alarms are set, so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of what's set and what isn't....the only way to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard re-boot.
- The calculator is a joke.  If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired.  A calculator watch in the '80's had more sophisticated features.  The user interface is so bad it's hard to describe it in words. 
- Microsoft truly does not understand how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that they've inflicted upon us since Windows 95.  Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menu button.  Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections.  Some features are simply hard to find, but should it really take so many menu selections to find common tools or applications?
- The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous - to put the device in "Silent" mode, but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up, for example, does not work.  Calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property.  The only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events....otherwise you get an alarm at midnight.
- So, on my Nokia phone a thousand years ago, when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I needed once landed.  The phone would then automatically connect to the provider available.  It wasn't completely automatic, but the user interaction was simple and intuitive.  Not with the Dash.  First of all T-Mobile doesn't help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming.  The feature is free so why not add a selection anyway?  All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone won't connect to the local network no matter what you do.  Now, assuming that you worked this out, you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local provider's network.  On my Blackberry this was automatic, but of course with Microsoft there are selections to make, searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice.  Assuming that you get connected at all.
- ActiveSync: This is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work.  Worse still, when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization.  It does not provide you with a fix, a hint or a path so that you don't lose data.  It does not even tell you the data that was lost.  So, I'm using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook and they can't get that right?  (OK, it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft, but come on.)  This was another primary purchasing driver for me.  I am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA - all the time.  It's the only way to keep organized.  I thought that with the same provider of all the software I'd be OK.  Also, as this feature has been around for over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry....how hard can it be?
There are probably annoying nits that I have with the software, but those are the major ones.  And they are major.
Considering this is Windows Mobile 5.0 what on earth were they doing for 1.0, 2.0, etc.?
Service Provider Pro
- T-Mobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe.  They have much better coverage over there than in the US (where I'm actually paying).
- Their package is competitive.
Service Provider Con:
- Coverage is not good enough.  I'm in San Francisco and I have dead spots in my house.
- Their back-end connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy.  At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connection and emails can't be accessed.  But you know there's nothing wrong with your connection because you've been on the browser.  Also, there was a whole day that emails were not accessible.  Because of the many issues that I'd had with email set up and maintaining a connection I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed.  When I finally called technical support they told me that their service was down - no apology, no notification, no nothing.  Certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience.  (So, why didn't I call technical support earlier?  read below...)
- Their technical support structure is terrible.  I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their "help" line.  I'm not going to go into details as it would just take too long.  Bottom line, if you have a problem with your phone say "Dash" at the prompt and then ask for Tier Three Data support.  Everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians you'll encounter have inadequate training.  If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial - DO NOT DO IT - This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device.
So, should you buy it?  Wait until Windows Mobile 6.0 comes out at least.     Maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time. Then see what else is available
My phone broke after a month or so.  After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted to blame me (did you put it in fluorescent light, did you put it in the sun, did you drop it, did you put it in your pocket and bend it, did you put it in your pocket and bump into something, did you drop it, did you break it, did you do something bad to it) they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money.
The most amusing part of the conversation went like this:  would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost $15?  When I responded that the ground would be fine she said "OK, that will be $9.95".  I had to laugh at their arrogance.
Due the lower price of the charge I decide to buy it, but it doesn't work on my Sony Ericson w300i at all, bad inversio
ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN,100 METROS DE ALCANCE Y SOLO PALABRAS NO SIRVE, NO LA DEBUELVO PORQUE ME SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO DE LO QUE CUESTA ESTA PORQUERI
The external antenna is a plastic decoration only and does not do anything functional.  False advertising
Poor construction, software that is difficult to install, unable to run when installed, and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy.  Buy something else that actually works
I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.  
The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes.
This item was an absolute waste of money and I'm all the more irritated for having purchased it.  Upon attempting to merely insert the device, the outer case of the dongle split open.  What I discovered?  That cute little 'antenna' doesn't actually connect to anything!  It's just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side!
When I finally managed to get the damn thing running (the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pair/connect a device) it worked fine - once.  I turned off my laptop, removed the dongle, and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all.
Do yourself a favor.  Shell out the extra 15-20-30 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2.0 bluetooth usb adapter.  Don't make this mistake
I am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up.  Instead, I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plug-and-play
The product works, but the software that claims to be windows compatible say's it is not when installing. Caused a lot of annoying delays when installing. Set system restore point before installing. Software hasn't caused any problems yet.
This is a terrible product. It is too big for your BlackBerry. They send it with another door for the backside because your current door won't fit over this huge battery!!
It is frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry, and Amazon, would foist this product on us.
The battery is so big that the device will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holster.
DO NOT BUY THIS IDIOTIC PRODUCT
This device is unusable with a Treo 600.  Every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card.  Don't waste your money
Label states that it is for a 600....it doesnt fit a 650 as well as I thought i
Very simple--It is not fit the Treo 650.  Look elsewhere for a case or clip
The KRZR is a really cool looking phone - but it has 2 huge issues - a very short battery life (1 day) and sllloooowwww reaction time - push the menu key and WAIT for it to come up.
I would explore other options
After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased.  Here are the main issues I have found with this phone:  1) The buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. And, believe me, I do not have very large hands.  2) If you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  You will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  VERY INCONVENIENT!!  There is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) On occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  Not optimal, and I probably just got a bad phone, but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola.  NOTE:  I have no personal vendetta against Motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing
I returned this phone after one week. Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you can't assign specifice ring tones to phone number.
Ear piecs sound quality is marginal.
text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small.
The back panel display is too small and hard to read.
i think that logitech make the best accessories.  I have the camera, the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard..... so naturally this headset was a no brainer.  The reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public.
It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub.  Don't you find that strange?  Aside from that, it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone (can't remember the model).  In addition, it really hurts my ears.. not the most comfortable.... so you decide if this product works for you.
This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.
Do yourself a favor and avoid this one
I've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. There was no notice when it disconnected. Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.
Logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant
I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller. 
Unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. I agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. It's true. It hurts.
Sound quality is very good. People say they can hear me just fine, and I can hear them just fine.
But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. What good is that? Then when the phone rings, I don't hear it. 
Then the clip broke on this one as well. Logitech again replaced it. But how long will this one lsat? 
Do yourself a favor and skip this one
This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.As for the performance it is great. I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely  reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. Amazon needs to fix the edit system on this
I've had two of these.  Both sounded and worked well for a few months.  then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second.  When this happens, you're perfectly operating  earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery.  While it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of "memory titanum" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium I bet)   Skip by this one if you're smart.  I've been had twice
The charger was not compatible with my Blackjack.  Terrible product, not as advertised
I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone (Unlocked)a month ago. I was hoping to get the color that I saw on the web page...and that's where the problem lies. 
The image shown is completely misleading.The phone that I received, was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site.
The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised. Also,the phone had 2 different color tones. At night/in the lighting at night, the top part of the phone(the part that flips open) and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray.
Needless to say, I spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange.I didn't have to pay the shipping charges. 
The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again, so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded.
I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided, but again they could not help me. Some one said it could be an item with a defect....but for me
the whole experience was  disappointing.
If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand, and the 'color' which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page...very misleading and wrong to all the customers.
Incidentally, this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it 'pink', but Amazon calls it 'mauve',though the phone and the image shown do not match. 
So stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone...all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted.
I have never met anybody that has ear-holes big enough for these! I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ear! That didnt work, so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound & talk sitting in the seat next to me. I would not reccomend these to anybody. Truth Hurts & these Hurt My Ears
I don't know about you folks, but I have small ears.  Though the sound on these ear buds are good, I can't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they're too big for me, and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears.  Unfortunately, this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords. Good idea, badly designed for size differences.
This product stopped working after about a week or two... lesson learned: buy OEM products instead of cheap knock-off
Amazon rebate is a scam.  I purchased this headset on 1/23/2007, and received it on 1/25/2007.  However, the RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1/25/2007.  When it works the next day, it can not locate the offer number, nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture.  If you click on the URL link supplied by Amazon Rebate form, you will be able to find the offer by Amazon order number, however, they will disconnect you in the next step saying 'session expired'.  There is no way around, what a scam.  It's a shame for Amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers.  It's $5.99, come on
I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone (which I love) but this case is to snug for it.  The slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out. It's a cute case, I would love to use if it was just a little larger.
It was really cute when I got it.  Two days later, the color started chipping away. The stones started falling off as well. I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it. I do not recommend buying it.
I bought this item at the end of January and received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to order another color and see if it does the same.  Not very happy with this
Door stop....They have the M610 listed so I took a chance, but it will not charge the phone.  So, I'm out $10.00 (50% of the sprint price, however, Sprint is out of stock right now...
I am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for Apple computers. Samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac. The company I ordered the cable from is great, easy to work with, but once again it does not work on a mac. Bummer. I have repeated that it does not work on a mac multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac. I blame Samsung
It did not fit my phone and I was forced to go out and but another one
I bought these adaptors to use regular head phones (3mm) with my cell phone mp-3 (LG cu500) player.  Once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound. you only can hear the music through one ear.  Whoever started the whole 2.5mm adaptor in cell phones should be put in jail.  It makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone.  I have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level.  They all have some type of flaw, the volume won't get loud enough, cord to short, poor sound, etc.
I received 2 2.5mm to 3.5mm stereo headphone adapter. One didn't work. The other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality. If you push the headphone jack(male) all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker. You have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers. And even then the quality is not good
I would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort.  The 2.5 mm jack is slightly too small, creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active.  I tried both adapters (i bought the 2-pack) in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose.  In positive news, the connection at the 3.5 mm end is nicely snug
The adapter did not work when plugged in to a samsung m500. The sound only came out of one ear when plugged in
The color of the product I received is nothing like the picture! If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you
I bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges.  Doh!  This crappy case broke within 3 weeks of use.  I only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did.  No jostling or forcing the case.  The little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time.
Do not buy this POS unless you want to throw your money out
I ordered one of these and it was dead on arrival.  Also, notice that this is not a Samsung OEM part.  If you call to ask for tech support from Samsung they will tell you they can't help you.  The only positive thing I have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless
I go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it. When i got it in the mail i found that the c.d. they burned and sent with it would not work. You had to have the product license number, which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy. i was never able to get it too work. my advvice to you is not to buy this product, but if you want to chance it you may be lucky. I wasnt
Cool Concept and everything but when I tried to install the driver my CD-Rom drive wouldnt even pick up that little CD
Worked good for a few months.. then battery started draining fast.  Now after just 1 or 2 calls the battery is dead. 
Bought this because Logitech has a great reputation with other products. I used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough. I actually went back to a Jabra wired unit until recently, when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable, has good battery life, and the sound is better. I guess I prefer the in-ear style
I have two of these head sets.  One never keeps its charge, pretty much from the time I bought it.  The other seems to charge alright.  the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime.
The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic.
Also it's big and heavy compared to the motorola I own.  I highly recomend the motorola. (sorry i dont know the model number off hand
Good sound nd price, nicely connect with mobile,,, however NOT WORK at all with my PC neither MAC... Once it's connected with my moble, they refuse to get in touch with any PC. they don't connect with 2 diveces in same time, it's OK,,,, but even if turn off my mobile nd renew all profile, still it's not changing. No Connection with MY PC,, so I was expecting use this for my Skype but NO WAY. real cheap gadget :
The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.
I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech
I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW POOR THIS PRODUCT WAS MADE. THE HELL WITH THIS PRODUCT. NOBODAY NOOOOOOOOOBOOOOOODY BUY THSI PRODUCT. TALK ABOUT POOR
Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer.
In the ad, this cable charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo. It will charge but I already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose. Falsely calims to sync
The phone is great .. and I knew it would be.  And I am a devoted Amazon shopper.  My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans ... a concern that has proved well founded.
I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this site indicating the Pearl "shipped hot," with an active SIM, which meant for those that -- like me - were upgrading (vs. new service), their existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route.  To be fair, that did NOT happen; however, I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept.
The instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the SIM, turn on the phone, and it will work.  And, if it doesn't work, it says, don't call Cingular, call Amazon.  I followed the instructions -- phone didn't work, I called Amazon, at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS!!!
Unfortunately, I let the poor guy have it ... I told him what I truly believe, which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone - which is supposed to work out of the box -- isn't working.
So - 5 Stars for the phone itself ... awesome!  2 stars for Amazon ... they do NOT have the kinks worked out yet.  On a positive note -- I immediately called Cingular, and they resolved the problem for me on the spot (SIM was not activated / in the system)
I've purchased this car charger for my Treo and the
order was delivered promptly. Unfortunately the
connector that was suppose to go into my Treo 650 did 
not fit (too big) so I wasn't able to connect it and
charge the phone. I send it back
this product was listed as being for my phone..when it arrived the cable did not list my phone model number and the software listed all other models. it was misleading. and it never worked even messed up my phone a little. and i lost 5.00 in shipping because of the decpetion
This product really needs Installation Assistance. Too many options and I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out. I'm going to call to get more info. 
ARRIVAL TIME = ***** 5 stars
PRICE = ***** 5 stars
Installation and Ease = * 1 sta
I bought this product, for my cell wich was listed on their description, and it so happens that the software will not work, they did not sent the drivers, I would not do business with this people again.
 this has not only been a waiste of money but also a waiste of time.
  Amazon should not permit them take people's money like that...
   Amazon suports those fakes
Junk! Sent with a CD that had a USB driver but wouldn't work on two different computers. Contacted the shipper, Bargaincell, but their only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed. The email stated emphatically that they don't provide support for the product. 
I bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer.  The description stated that it would work for my selected model phone, however, it does NOT!!  The software needed to download the pictures is not correct. When we called the customer services they were of no help - they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem.  Apparently I am not the only person to have this problem with the product.  Again, the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate.  It does not work
This product is the worst of its kind! It lasted a couple of months at the most, it is not at all worth the price, no matter how cheap. I picked one up at WalMart for ten bucks that works great, don't waste your time on this one. It is cheap, but don't be had, stay away from this product
My old Audiovox phone, the 8500 was great. It fell in the toilet, though, and they didn't sell them anymore at the Virgin webstore, so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store. What a big mistake. It is awful with the poor sound quality, short battery life, horrible ringtones, and worst of all, I was unable to ever retrieve my voicemail! Hello? and it has the most horrible graphics. Does anyone want to buy it, along with all the accessories?? It is barely used...
So I looked on Ebay and found a used 8500 and bid on it, won it, and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610. I like the 8500s micro-size, simplicity, ringtones, animated graphics, etc. I must be careful not to lose it, or drop it in the toilet again, though. My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one, but I cannot get another replacement as I bought this one used.
The pay as you go works fine for me as I do not want to have a cell phone clued to my head. I use it to check my land line for messages and for brief calls. Do not buy the 8610, whatever you do
This review is more about Virgin Mobil customer service than the phone. I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1/22/2007 online thru Virgin Mobile. The phone wouldn't charge. I called customer service and explained the problem. They said did I want a charger or another phone. I replied that I could not tell if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a new kit.  I received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldn't charge.
 I called customer service and explained the issue and it must be the charger at fault. The rep said they would not send a new charger, that I would have to purchase one. 
 I said this didn't make any sense, according to the offer I could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charge  I need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to get a charger?  The support rep said yes and that I had to make up my mind - either return the phone or purchase a charger. 
 I asked to speak to a supervisor. The customer support rep kept going off line (to talk to someone?) but refused or couldn't get a supervisor to talk to me.  She then asked for the ESN number of the phone. When I said I didn't know what an 'ESN' number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the 
phone. I'm not clear why she needed this, since I haven't activated the phone and I already referenced the order (vmu) number.  At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep (obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile) and  at least she was trying to track down some info - or so I thought - she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldn't handle my order - that I would have to call back.  I called back, had to work my way thru the answering system and got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike.  Mike  explained that they couldn't send a charger (none in stock) and that I would have to send the entire phone back - which is what I am now doing - 60+ minutes after the initial call. 
I have to say that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive. They customer service staff is  obviously  poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions.  The interfaces with support are youth geared - not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally.  I am sending the phone back for a refund and re-considering the provider for pay-as-you-go service.   01/26/2007.
I have had this phone for about six months.  I replaced a Kyocera that I disliked because it was so big, but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems.  The menus are very poorly designed, they are difficult to navigate and it's hard to do anything.  The ringer speaker is inside the phone, so when it's closed, it's almost impossible to hear.  I almost never hear it ring.  I usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on, but if you turn the phone off, the vibrate gets turned off, so you have to remember to turn that back on!  I hate this phone, and will be replacing it soon.
 I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VM's warranty was up and i had just purchased a $20 phone card + had airtime credits which were not refundable.
  Now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment.My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches what-so-ever so i was pretty upset.After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they weren't going to do anything to help.
 
     I was offered a replacement slider at $20.Obviously I didn't want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610.By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN (when i called to activate the phone)they have the nerve to tell me that I could've purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of $24.99 because the slider died.The f!@%ng idiots!HELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONER???and after i spent $50 + tax.sheesh!
  Anyway back to the phone review..the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here.Its so low that if its in my purse i can't even hear it! WTF??? Also the battery life sucks, no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half.It also doesnt get good service with the VM/Sprint network, my slider had xcellent service w/it despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls.
   
   So I've had it 5 days and I'm considering attempting to bring it back where I purchased it from.However i don't want to buy an expensive phone from VM because I'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them.
  The way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell + they are expensive.I am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise.Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customer but not anymore.  
The phone may be fine but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile service never really worked. Perhaps it was the phones fault I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account. Overall their customer service is AWFUL. Days of waiting and receiving no information. I had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right. I spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed. Now I have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service. I plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone. Its garbage.
I went with the T-Mobile Sidekick and already am way happier
This phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap. Its useless, the software on it is very cheap and childish. Not professional at all, the camera is pitiful, and the keys are too small for anyone who doesn't have 10yr old hands. Just because it has a qwerty keyboard; that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash. Purchase a different phone this one is not worth it
 Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline.  Shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month??  They refuse to refund or replace.  They are a shady company and I'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same
I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes. 
The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.
* Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.
* Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B
* Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.
* Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.
* No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.
* Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great. 
* Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and "A" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??
* Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.
In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you.
After owning 3 Blackberry's over the years, I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering. 
If you're thinking about a Blackjack, I encourage you to be aware that, for one, the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys, and, that you may well be on your own when it comes to service. I feel that it's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not, the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right.
You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract.  The wire is very thin, so I'm thinking it will not last long
I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and it's nice to have one charging while I'm using the other--you don't have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone.  So I also bought one of Boxwave's batteries for the 8525.
Well, the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine, but it refuses to charge the battery that came with my 8525.  This really limits its usability as an off-line charging device.
The cradle itself plugs into the USB port on the phone, which was not designed with cradling in mind, so it's not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle.  Since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone (who's idea was that anyway?) it almost always gets pressed while I'm wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle.  This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station.
Anyway, just my opinion, but it's actually easier to connect the standard USB charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle, so I'd recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard USB charger.
If you really want to do all charging off-line you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one
I ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails!
Stay away not recommended
This case actually scratches and destroys your pearl. The inside is very rough and uneven; pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone. The phone doesn't provide any protection on top. I really regret buying this ... my phone is all scratched. Get a soft case that stays on permanently. Pass this one up
When I first received the items they didn't work and them I returned and had to spend more money and they still don't work.  I even had the computer specialist at work try and they couldn't even get them to work.  I sent them a e-mail to receive my money back, because I didn't want to keep spending money to send items back that don't work back.  Who would have guessed, but they never replied.  Thanks for waisting my time and money.  I will never buy any from you again and will inform others to beware
Misleading pictures... the Holster is Triangular.. not Rectangular as the picture would suggest.. Also, it does not fit well with the RAZR phone... I'm afraid the phone will fall off any second if I use it... This one goes to the trash can..
After hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to work, It eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time, and then never worked again. My opinion is to stick with the OEM cable. The extra money's worth paying to avoid the headache
Do NOT purchase this "Flexi-Skin. What a waste of 20 bucks!!  The skin hinders the camera's functionality.  A very small portion of the "Flexi-Skin" blocks the camera lens, thereby messing up the photos. I had to trim a portion of the skin away in order to take unobstructed pictures.  Next, it makes your otherwise super-pimp phone look like a bulky piece of junk, more akin to a Zach-Morris style Nokia from 1993..................Additionally,  The Flexi-Skin actually TRAPS dust and other particles between the skin and the phone.    This item blows in both functionality and aesthetics, don't waste you money! ! !  
First time when I plugged in, the cell phone displayed error message that "Charging Error, remove immediately". since then I am not using this
I ordered this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phone. I was so happy to see the package to arrive since using my finger or a pen is not an optimal way to work with this device. 
Sadly these replacement parts do not match the factory specifications. These styluses do not fit into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out further than the manufacturer designed. This makes it easy for the stylus to fall out and does not create a smooth and clean design / look for the phone with the replacement installed.
If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase. The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised.
I am disappointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus.

The item did not work with my T-mobile MDA except in one ear bud. I tried it on another phone and it work. Sound quality is not that goo
This has all of the features of the headset that came with my phone, and it was much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from T-mobile.
Brand new, and I had to jiggle the cable near the plug to get it to work. In order to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart, which could have broken the wires if I weren't careful, and may tear further through wearing it. 
The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces; this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple. 
There are several places which I'm worried will break soon through normal wear and tear. The ear pieces are hard plastic, and look like they'll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time. The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music. Also be warned that shipping was listed as $5 for a $7 item, when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 2-3 stamps.
The cable is barely 3 feet long from mike to plug, so I don't recommend it for tall people.
It will do until I can find better, but that's the best I can sa
Says the USB Data Cable works on a VX8600. No driver was included, and no drivers are available on-line for this.  None of the drivers that came with the package worked, either.
As for their return policy, after a couple e-mail exchanges they just sent me an address; they did not comment on paying for shipping or giving me any compensation.  I don't want to wrap something up that I already paid shipping for when it was already an inexpensive item.  Time is money
i didnt got the car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it. WRONG ITEM
It has a samsung logo, but it looks fake after I bought it. The belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason
This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
I guess you get what you pay for, so I wasn't totally surprised that the battery didn't work.  What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a new one, they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paid for it.  Don't do business with these guys, and don't buy this battery
I can't complain about shipping, it was really fast. But i get the thing i plug it in, use it 1 time. The 2nd time i plug it in, the metal piece that plugs into the phone, jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding it, making a freakin paper weight. Cheap piece of cra
I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4" x 1 3/4" x 0.5", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into.
Considering that the seller enters the "product dimensions" as 4 ounces instead of the measurments, one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake.
I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly
PLEASE READ!!!!This cases does not fit the LG enV. Dont Bu
The cable is really junk.  All I want is a cable to sync my phone and update software.  It won't do it.  Half of the time the computer fails to recognize the phone is connected.  A motorola brand data-only cable works just fine.  I was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened.  The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers.  Problem is, the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connecting/disconnecting as mentioned above.  Save money and buy the OEM part.
Moto cord $30 with software
This cord $10 + $30 for moto cord when you realize it's junk.  
Be smarter than me and heed the warnings
I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the original Palm Pilot and have loved them (I think I had three different models over the years). I wanted a smart phone so I could check my email so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm product and so I could stay with my current mobile provider, Cingular. Now I am counting the days until my 2 year commitment ends so I can punt this awful, awful product. I may even bite the bullet and pay off my commitment early just so I can get rid of it.
The battery problem is huge. You must remember to stick this in a charger whenever you can. If you forget and leave it in your pocket overnight then it will be dead the next day. I have turned off every thing I can find that sucks power and it still drains amazingly fast. It won't even last a day if you make very many calls.
The reception is terrible. I've had a Cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of So. California (except for my house of course). With this phone I think you have to be right underneath an antenna to get a signal. I was on a conference call yesterday and got dropped twice. I am envious everytime I get in an elevator with someone who can talk on their cell phone because mine will freeze up any time I try that. 
Yes, it freezes up often. The only way I have found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery and let it do a hard reboot.
The versa mail program that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with. You must leave your work computer on to check the corporate mail. That means if I am traveling with my computer, the phone's corporate mail program will not work. It often will not sync anyway. 
I don't think the browser that comes with the phone will work with Java, so I cannot check my Yahoo mail either. I tried going back and forth to the pre-Java version of Yahoo and that is too much of a pain.
I get all kinds of weird messages with the phone. I haven't ever been able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software, something that never happened when I upgraded before.
Yes, there is a manual that is huge. It is hard to use on line so I guess I need to bite the bullet and print out the whole thing and then take a week of vacation to read it and see if I can make any of these neat functions that I read about work.
Hardly a week goes by that I don't actively think how much I hate this phone. I actually signed on to Amazon today just to write this because the phone wasn't working properly today. What a piece of junk!
Palm could not resolve all the issues associated with Treo. I bought this phone few days back and it freezes frequently.
I've had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular.  I've gone through 4 phones - the same thing over and over.  Never did they (or I) put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD card (although right now it's working, and the card is not in it - go figure!).  So, I guess the options are not download things, but have the phone work, or download things onto my SD card, and not have a phone
Poor quality product.
The product is two rigid pieces of plastic.
A slight warpage of back piece of my plastic case made 
it impossible to fit my chocolate phone.  
You won't know if your case will fit until you try to put it on!!!
You're taking a chance if you buy this produc
I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years. Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price, I thought my fulfilled contract (I am on month to month now) meant I could qualify for a "new account" and keep my number. No such luck. After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly, I had to return it. It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75% lower than a loyal 13 year customer! I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750
I ordered this phone on 3/28/07. It shipped via FEDEX on 3/29/07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3/2/07. The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for. This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving.  FEDEX's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded.  For the $100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store.
battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of the time
The product was sent with a plastic bag, no manual, not anything, only the base and tha ac charger wall. When I tried, it 's not working, neither the cradle, neither the aditional battery charger
I got rid of the bulky i355s at the end of our contract and bought two of these for our account.  We had to return the first phone (line1) within days of getting it as it would randomly shut off (crash), and other times the volume would fluctuate on its own.  Exchanging it was an ordeal with Sprint - they charged me for the replacement phone and still haven't credited my account after two billing cycles.  A few months later and now the second phone (line2) is crashing.  I'll make a call and hang up - and it shuts off.  Other times it will shut off in the middle of the call.  The other night I went to charge it and it said invalid battery - so I took the battery out and put it back in.  Then it said "invalid charger."  I might go back to the i355, it was rugged, reliable (but large) phone.  I guess I'll have to haggle with Motorola about getting this one fixed/replaced
How hard can it be , shipped a cell phone carrying case instead of a charger
I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.
$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume
I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy
The sound is great, and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others.  The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear -- this is a first (and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them).
The device works fine and I don't feel I over paid.  
Sure there are better hands free devices out there, but this one is reliable. 
My perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine.
I use the headset all day without any discomfort. I higly recommend it over the other types of headset
i helped develop the danger hiptop (aka "t-mobile sidekick) and hated holding its brick-like nature to my head ... i wanted a good headset ...
the only problem is i *hate* earbuds, so i wasn't looking forward to shopping for/buying one.  i went to the local super-electronics store, and abusing their return policy, bought one of every headset they had to try -- 23 headsets to be exact ... i picked up the jabra only to be a complete-ist, figuring there was no way i'd buy its star-trek-bugs-crawling-in-chekov's-ear styling.
but after trying them all, the jabra was *easily* the best feeling and best fitting.  
in a nutshell, here are the things i like about this unit in particular:
* it comes with 6 different fittings (3 sizes for the right and the left), so you get a chance to get a *much* closer fit than some generic ear piece.
* contrary to what others have said here, the ear pieces stay *very* snug in your ear (if they don't, you're not fitting them correctly).
* i wear glasses, so i can't tolerate over-the-ear headsets.  this, of course, is great in that way.
* i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic ear-only jabra because it:
  1. let's people know you're talking on the phone, and less likely to interrupt you while you're talking.
  2. i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise.
* it's small and easy to wrap up into my cell case.
also in the newest version, they've adding a securing "lip" to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece (this definitely was a problem before).
to top it all off, jabra's support is excellent.  i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me *three* replacements, free of charge, along with a ball point pen for my "troubles."
at 10 bucks, these things are a steal ... using one with my hiptop is a joy -- it means i can still contruct sms's, type in emails, add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone.  if you have a data device of any kind, this will make your phone experience twice as good.
a truly great product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right.  what more could you want?
thanks for reading
I think this is a pretty good earpiece...  granted, I've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's Nokia), but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort.  Where my friend's would fall out of my ear, this one (once I got it figured out) never comes loose.    Second, listening to people on my friend's, I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well, and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when I'm not using the earpiece.  Finally, when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece, she sounds distant and muffled; I've had no complaints from the people I'm talking to using the Jabra, and, in fact, my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I don't.
The ear gels are a bit hard to get used to.  They are oddly shaped (as you can see in the picture), and there are six of them total-- three of them for each ear.  Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels, while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces they've used and that they fit perfectly...  I can honesly say I've had both experiences.  When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head: *very* frustrating.  I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could, I tried holding it in place with my hand, but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands-free earpiece.  Nothing seemed to work.  I was thinking of returning it.  I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I-95.  And then one day, somehow, I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear-- with the little poky-out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal (not the fold on the top of your ear; if you do that it'll just pop out again)-- and then *voila* it stays put.  Matter o' fact, it'll stay put so well that it'll be a little bit difficult-- even *painful*-- to get out again.
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes, different patience levels, and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own.  But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out, I was golden.  I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it.
Admittedly, it is a bit difficult to get into your ear-- I'd say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly (before you're good and practiced at it), which may not sound like a lot, but it's long enough to not recognize somebody's voice or hear the first sentence they say, or whatever.  A *very mild* frustration.  But like all things good and pleasant, it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone, slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat.  In fact, I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that it's in until I go to scratch my ear or something!
The other complaint that I saw on here was that it's not compatible with Nokia phones.  In fact, it even says right on the package that it's not compatible with Nokia.  That's funny, I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine.  They make two other models of EarBoom (one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone), both of which claim to be Nokia compatible, and *neither* of those works with my phone!  Confusing?  Yes!  The problem is it doesn't work with *all* Nokia phones.  While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with, but it didn't include mine (it included one that was, numerically speaking, very close to my model: the 3590); which piqued my curiosity.  And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them.  One of them worked, the other didn't.  The strange part of it was that we couldn't see a visible difference in the two units...  and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it (that's this one, and if you look closely at the picture you can see them), while the other one (the one marked as Nokia compatible) had three.  Hmmm...  Curious.
So my advice is to either know your phone well (as in, have the little book handy) or ask for help before purchasing.
All in all 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars on performance and comfort, but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging.
Addendum:
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end...  And living in windy Providence, this is a bit of an annoyance.
Also, for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldn't hear the person on the other end of the line (and, likewise, they couldn't hear me) unless I jiggled the little jack.  This was *very *FRUSTRATING.**  Now, for some reason, I'm not having that problem anymore.  I'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom.  Either way, it's something buyers should be aware of
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost (yeah Amazon!), but that's not why I'm writing this review.
I'd like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom.  The eargel thingies are designed quite well, of the three different sizes for each ear you're bound to find one that fits very comfortably.  Turns out I couldn't find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side.  My wife had the exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears!  I hate jogging so can't comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed.  I'd have to imagine it'd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place.
Sound quality from the earbud is decent, but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity, especially the higher frequencies.  Normally this is not a problem, but it can sometimes make the person you're talking to sound like Isaac Hayes.  The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse, without having the voices washed over with background noise.  The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving.  There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum, while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths.
I've asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive, my voice comes through loud and clear despite the boom's apparent lack of length, reinforcing my belief that size DOESN'T matter.  In fact, I have found the mic to be very sensitive to even small sounds.  Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click.  Another example, I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed!!  Yes, the mic is that sensitive.  Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears.  Not that it's obtrusive to the other person on the phone, it's just good to be aware they can hear it all.
What more to say about such a simple device. Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product.  In fact, I just ordered another - it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says &quot;Universal 2.5mm Jack&quot;  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product
I've been using my T809 since January and mostly love it.  Three main problems:  
1) There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens.  Looks like crap when the display is inactive.  I've read that other people have this problem too.  
2) I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset (they won't stay in my ears!) and because you can't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music.
3) The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume.  If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings (too quiet) and by the time I realize I'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket, I've usually missed the call.  This sucks and I don't think there's a setting to disable this "feature".
It's close to ideal, but no cigar.  Camera's great, reception's great, easy to use.  But I'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires.
BTW, if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone, make sure you see it on the bill.  I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying.   TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance, but fortunately Amazon exchanged it.
Ive always stayed away from the flip/slider phones because Im good at breaking things...Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong.  The mini sd port is awesome
The phone is great. You can check all the specs online and in other posts. You'll see that they're awesome.
From my experience...
Pros: 
- lots of features
- Slick phone... I do care about how my gadgets look like.
- camera resolution is pretty good.
Cons:
- hard to find a good case. I'm still looking for a good one. The one I got, my phone will slip out of it once in a while.
- If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it, fugget'boutit.... Althought it's not really the phone's fault, but BMW's (as I've read on other msg boards), it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW...
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.
if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing!!! don't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that??!!! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it!!! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn;t have a chord. jeez!
Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!?
Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena.
I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike.
Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking
These are very good and not expensive.
You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.
I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!
Anybody want to trade the extras
These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping. 
The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
I love these eargels.  My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out.  They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds.  Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them.  (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.
I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes.
I recently got this phone and love it.  T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is.  The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown.  I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades
Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome? 
If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. 
One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage
I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service! 
This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.  
Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone
I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldn't be happier. I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. I am very happy with it. T-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
The device works fine and I don't feel I over paid.  
Sure there are better hands free devices out there, but this one is reliable.

This was *very *FRUSTRATING.**  Now, for some reason, I'm not having that problem anymore.  I'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom.  Either way, it's something buyers should be aware of
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost (yeah Amazon!), but that's not why I'm writing this review.
I'd like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom.  The eargel thingies are designed quite well, of the three different sizes for each ear you're bound to find one that fits very comfortably.  Turns out I couldn't find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side.  My wife had the exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears!  I hate jogging so can't comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed.  I'd have to imagine it'd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place.
Sound quality from the earbud is decent, but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity, especially the higher frequencies.  Normally this is not a problem, but it can sometimes make the person you're talking to sound like Isaac Hayes.  The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse, without having the voices washed over with background noise.  The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving.  There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum, while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths.
I've asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive, my voice comes through loud and clear despite the boom's apparent lack of length, reinforcing my belief that size DOESN'T matter.  In fact, I have found the mic to be very sensitive to even small sounds.  Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click.  Another example, I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed!!  Yes, the mic is that sensitive.  Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears.  Not that it's obtrusive to the other person on the phone, it's just good to be aware they can hear it all.
What more to say about such a simple device. Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product.  In fact, I just ordered another - it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says &quot;Universal 2.5mm Jack&quot;  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product
I've been using my T809 since January and mostly love it.  Three main problems:  
1) There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens.  Looks like crap when the display is inactive.  I've read that other people have this problem too.  
2) I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset (they won't stay in my ears!) and because you can't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music.
3) The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume.  If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings (too quiet) and by the time I realize I'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket, I've usually missed the call.  This sucks and I don't think there's a setting to disable this "feature".
It's close to ideal, but no cigar.  Camera's great, reception's great, easy to use.  But I'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires.
BTW, if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone, make sure you see it on the bill.  I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying.   TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance, but fortunately Amazon exchanged it.
Ive always stayed away from the flip/slider phones because Im good at breaking things...Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong.  The mini sd port is awesome
The phone is great. You can check all the specs online and in other posts. You'll see that they're awesome.
From my experience...
Pros: 
- lots of features
- Slick phone... I do care about how my gadgets look like.
- camera resolution is pretty good.
Cons:
- hard to find a good case. I'm still looking for a good one. The one I got, my phone will slip out of it once in a while.
- If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it, fugget'boutit.... Althought it's not really the phone's fault, but BMW's (as I've read on other msg boards), it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW...
I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.
$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume
I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy
The sound is great, and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others.  The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear -- this is a first (and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them).
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.
if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing!!! don't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that??!!! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it!!! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn;t have a chord. jeez!
Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!?
Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena.
I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike.
Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking
These are very good and not expensive.
You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.
I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!
Anybody want to trade the extras
These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping. 
The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
I love these eargels.  My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out.  They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds.  Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them.  (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.
I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes.
I recently got this phone and love it.  T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is.  The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown.  I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades
Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome? 
If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. 
One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage
I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service! 
This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.  
Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone
I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldn't be happier. I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. I am very happy with it. T-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
Love it.  Sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel.  Some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but it's still red which is nice.  I will probably get another color on it for spring.  The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different.  Also maintains all openings for data cables etc
Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m.  Fits perfectly. 
I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking.
I keep i860 cell phone in the 'Glove all the time.  It does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone.  It fits it, after all, like a glove.
When I am taking a photo, I simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is, take the photo, and slip it back on.  
Before I used to know about this, I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way, like a wayward lock of hair.  Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary.  They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case, take photo(s), and snap it back on.  Smart.
In fact, the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half.  Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it, guys.   It's a snap!  Snaps unsnap; that is what they are for.
The glove is well named.  It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand.  I can easily pivot it around in my hand, flip it around, pick it up, and basically not expect it to skid around.  Without the 'Glove, you have a bare metal or plastic case.  Smooth looking and - well, maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars!
I like the fast release for the belt hook.  So far, it has not failed me.  I think it is at the bottom, not at the back the way some people have said, but I cannot remember for certain. I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet.
I don't use it that way much though.  The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. I easily fit it in my pocket.  With the glove on, I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily
This protects my PPC 6700 wonderfully... I've dropped it many times and this case protected it like I wanted... No scratches, nothing... Having room for the extended battery is great too, because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone
Was received in a timely manner, however, the picture online was not what I expected.  For the price, I really thought it was a little cheap looking in person.  As it was a gift, I was somewhat disappointed in the quality.  However, the person I gave it to was pleased
This headseat is pretty neat when you're on the road or just relaxing between work.  It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pause/play and answer/hangup features.  The comfort of the ear budds could be a little better, but the stereo sound is great
Fast service, good price. Look forward to future business dealings.
This is a great product. The only area of improvement would be the belt clip. It is very difficult to attach to the belt. Over all it is a great case
I Really like this phone, the camera quality, the software, everything is excellent
This is really cool phone and has many features. Unfortunately, you could not use some of these features in the U.S. One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price. Its price is just 429.99 on the Nokia's web page.
The phone gets 5 stars but the retailer's price gets -2 stars.
I will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned.Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear
Just received it this week.  Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model, the photos are much better (both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses, but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the N90).  Also, the N73 covers all radio bands, making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae).  The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular, so depending on the city I was in, I occasionally had very spotty coverage.  The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90, and best of all, it is much more compact than the N90, fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket.  Last, there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone, protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?).  As usual, the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera, but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds. 
If you don't use this phone, it costs $3/month.  Normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute, which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost.  Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when I'm in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing.  I don't use cell phones much, but if I must have one, I might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill.  For kids who think they can mangle the budget, forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo.  Once they use up the card, the only number they can dial is 911, but that's it.  Bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day.  At some point, I might not be able to live without this. 
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.   
 I was completely satisfied with the phone clip I purchased. It`s sturdy and well constructed. I would recommend it.I will use this site again
I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. THE FEATURES ARE SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THIS PHONE IS A NET 10 WIRELESS PHONE. NET 10 WIRELESS IS A SUBSIDIARY OF TRACFONE.  I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE. I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON [...] ITS A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN CALLING
I've been using this phone with the Net10 service since March, and have to say I am very happy with it.  Coverage areas have been great.
I don't use a cell phone very often, so this was the most economical way for me to go. Although the phone doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have....it gets the job done
I have not had any problems with this phone.I dont use it for long periods at a time ...only in the car and for text.Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER.I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare...so its great for me.I got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper.Overall,I would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week
I like this little flip phone.  The service has been good and the features are easy to use.  The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phone will last.  The flip part is a little weak, but we will have to see.  It was really easy to add minutes, and you can do it right from your Net10 phone
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  
As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow
After buying the new LG Chocolate, I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it. I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value. So far, it's worked just like it should
When I first got this, it did not look like it was big enough for my phone, but as soon as I opened the package and put my phone in it I could tell it was a perfect fit. I really like the clear window, which I did not have on my previous case, now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time
This is the best bluetooth I have used. Wind noice no problem, user friendly coustomer support for Cardo is great . I have 5 co worker who has order the headset. Just a great product. Great pric
My only complaint, and consequently the 4-star rating, is that sometimes I don't hear the Blackberry or feel the vibration. Apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the OEM plastic holster
This is a great way to carry the blackberry.  It also keeps it protected.  I would recommend this product
Provides great protection for the Treo,
but does add a noticeable amount of thickness,
making it more of a bundle
Overall, I like it.  The best part is the flip up screen protector.  I have had 2 Zire models and managed to break both screens.  My dislike is that I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting.  I have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again, to no avail.  As for the SD card issue, I remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject. To keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo, I drilled a hole in the back, right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes
The skin is very useful, but can be improved on ways to put it on and take it off
I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Treo 650 so I can "stay in touch", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome!
No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Treo 650 Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product. 
A must have for anyone who owns a Treo 650. I also see they have these for the Blackberries
Iam very pleased with this item, I purchased it for my son
I made the mistake of ordering a $7.00 battery and I thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting. I replaced my new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ. So word to the wise... Just get this battery and you will not have my problems. Well worth it
This item works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack.  The sound quality is exceptional.  The only problem is that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to fall off
When I bought my Motorola V220, my Cingular Store charged top dollar for the car charger - and they were sold out. I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon.  The car charger is compatible with the V220, and it comes with case and hands-free ear bud - all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone.  The ear bud does not have the best sound - voices come across as somewhat muffled, though still audible - and the case is adequate.  I wouldn't buy this set specifically for those items, although they both work with/fit the V220.  As I see it, they were bonuses for purchasing the charger.
Five stars for the charger, three for the rest
This item was easy to find, purchase and use. Saved us several dollars as well. A true win-win. Thanks
The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy.  The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TX--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX.  For some reason, the cable won't let me charge using the USB wall-charger I got for my wife's iPod, but it does charge the TX off my computer's USB port (which is a Powerbook G4--notorious for being underpowered)
Great reception, great volume controls, easy to use... I have the blue, my husband, the black... To the reviewer who said, "too thin" - well, don't get the thin phone then... Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra (plug in) - even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones... which other phone would most likely make you buy.  We're in our late 20s/early 30s - and just dig the phone.  Fits perfect in a small purse or wallet.  
One issue DH has -- the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into (bottom of the phone) and when he is on speaker phone, he tends to hold it there, and it sometimes can make your bars go down.  That is it, and all you have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone
I really like this phone..  its cute, its little, its perfect for a young woman.  I had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't an mp3 player (i have an ipod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a pda (i have a palm tx)... its just simple and cute.
its bluetooth compatible... although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth, but i'm not sure if its the headset or the phone..
**the ringer on it is SUPER quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse.  i'm grown accustomed to "listening" for the vibrate feature instead.
i like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list.  
i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable.
sound quality is good, on both ends
i dig it.  im sure you will too
I have trouble to buy from Bestbuy, but I ordered it from amazon, cheapest price and good product! Thanks
The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from Scratches, it fits like a glove , really nice , the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked  after 5 days of use, it wasn't hit or treated carelessly. I'll order some more because they are really cheap and  it's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone.Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition, the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it.
Got this to protect my Motorola L6 phone.  It fits the phone like a glove.  I also love that it protects the phone screen.  The only complaint is that the case open easily if it's dropped or handled in a rough way.  Clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that.  My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it. The case still does not have a chip or crack on it
A perfect fit for my L6. I love the protection for the screen....it covers all of it so you don't need those plastic screen covers. Don't be afraid if you drop your phone... because it's protected
I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and they last about six-twelve months.  I bought this one and it is much more solid of construction, shorter cord, and a better angle to the power adapter.  i bought two of these for less than the cost of one from Sprint.  My wife carries her's in her purse, while I just keep mine in my car.  This is the best car charger for the Treo and I have had Treo's for about 6 years
fits the cell phone well and seems secure. i like the catch that holds it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
I recommend this phone to ANYBODY.  I absolutely love it.  I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far.  The music player is great, and I swear...the camera looks ALOT better than 1.3 mega pixel.  The handset is wonderful, and so is the headset included with it.  If you buy this phone, it WILL last you a long time.  
But yeah..so far, no problems whatsoever.  I love it. [..
I am in love...with my phone!  I know that sounds absurd, but it's true.  Originally, I had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting this one; seeing how I had already done so with the Motorola V3T.  
Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorola's V3T RAZR handsets (both for having them freeze at startup), I called customer service and told 'em I wanted this handset instead.  With a minor contract extension/handset upgrade, I was glad I made the switch to NOKIA.  I've only had it for 24 hours and I'm totally satisfied with it.  Below is a list of "pro's and con's" for you to consider:
Pros:
- Bright and visible LCD screen.
- MP3-ringtones enabled (make sure to cut your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so).
- Video ringers.
- Pretty fast charge, even while messing around with it.
- Bluetooth and infrared-enabled making for quick file transfers.
- Dialing keypad is raised for easy input.
- Date can be enabled on screen (which the V3T lacks).
- Comes with "headphone jack adapter" which enables use of any standard headphone that you may have.
Cons:
- Vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges (by default).
- Power button is somewhat small and difficult to execute.
- FM radio plays with static (this may varies by area).
As you can see, the pro's outweight the con's with this one, so give it at try.  Also, if you decide that it's not for you, return it to T-Mobile within 14 business days of your purchase and get a full refund.  As for me, I won't returning it because it's definitely a keeper!  :
I purchased this phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed. I haven't used all the functions yet (downloading music), but haven't had any problems with anything else. Here are some pros and cons:
Pros
1-Colorful/Clear Display
2-Good Volume (ringer volume is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine)
3-Easy Menu Navigation
Cons
1-No shortcut to get to main menu (have to keep pressing "back" button)
2-Battery access (it's really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and SIM card-could be a good thing though)
3-On/Off Button (it's very small-basically have to use my fingernail)
I got a chance to play with one of these last week. The external speaker is very loud, the controls are easy to use and best of all, it comes with a 1GB card. My only gripe is the slide feels a little loose; I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake. All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capability/software is a lot better than my KRZR
I purchased this Nokia 5300 Black at the T-Mobile store. It does come with 1 GB memory card and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems. Phone comes with USB cable to connect to your computer. I have a Mac so this was easy to do. You will not be able to download songs bought from iTunes but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4. You can hold up to 500 songs if they are all 3.5 minutes long and compressed to 128 kps. My music is usually remixed and/or longer than 3.5 minutes each.
I wasn't able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook but I was able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car. Apple has not approved the Nokia 5300 yet to sync. I am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new.
Overall, I love the feel of this phone, has wonderful 2 in screen, color is great, camera is cool, and it is very intuitive to use. 
I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia. However, the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned. 
Once you load up your songs, the speaker is impressive. This morning, I had the phone playing music in one part of the house, and I had to go get something at the other end of the house, and I could still hear the music perfectly.
Calling on the phone was better than expected. I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of people/background noise and I was able to carry on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my Samsung that was difficult to do this with.
The phone is quite sturdy. And I am happy to have a phone that not everyone has - a Motorola Razor. This Nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but I feel like I have a very unique phone that is more than a phone. 
Who needs an iPod mini when you can get this and your phone all in one?
I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone. There is very little to chose from at the T-Mobile store as far as accessories and Nokia.com didn't have much either.
*****
The alarm feature to wake up is cool too. You can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm. It also comes with programmable snooze. What a dream!
*****
You can make calls without even having to slide the phone to dial. As long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book, then all you have to do is look up and press the green button! 
*****
When you are playing your music, if an incoming call comes in, it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in. Once you are done with the phone call, you can resume playing your music.
*****
As I said, this phone is a gem in all areas - speaker, sturdy, colorful, I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing, call quality is great even in loud areas, and lots of little creature comforts.
Definitely consider this phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone. Else, this may not be the phone for you
I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part. The first thing you'll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is.  This is a slider phone, and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys. The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number that's not in your contacts and to text message. 
Next, we go to the features.  So we got a 1.3MP camera, camcorder, music player, 1GB microSD card, bluetooth support, and infrared port..and *drumroll please* an FM radio.  Now, the FM radio isn't satellite based, so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the U.S., just those stations local to you.
Now I will go into the good and bad things about each feature:
1.  Camera - Impressive picture quality. Yes it's only 1.3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras, but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does? 5/5
2.  Camcorder - Not all that impressive.  While you are recording, the quality seems perfect.  However, once you play it, it turns a bit distorted.  Plus, it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card. 3/5
3.  Music Player - Impressive.  The speaker is of good quality, and very loud.  However, I still could not find a way to change the order of the songs without making a playlist.  There's play, pause, next song, previous song, fast forward, and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures. The buttons must be pressed fairly hard, so your music won't start playing spontaneously in your pocket. Also, I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds. 4/5
4. FM Radio - I bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement.  Well, the truth is you don't need to buy anything extra.  Just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone, and this will serve as an 'antenna' and will allow you to hear stations. And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio, yes the sound will go to the earbuds. However, there's a 'loudspeaker' option that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker, but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in, as it serves as the 'antenna'.  This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone, you NEED to have the earbuds with you. You may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna (or you may have to move) in order to get clear reception. 3/5
Misc. Info:
Only two games to included, and both trials. (Lumines, Texas Hold'em)
You can't transfer games from another phone. You must pay and download them again.
You can't delete the pre-created profiles (those that come with the phone). You can just create your own.
In order to change the phone to vibrate, you must make a vibrating profile. Then to use it, it takes several steps, which is not hard, but inconvenient.  
The interface shows the month and date, but not the day of the week.
Only two face templates included with the phone.
That's all for now.
Overall: 4/
I'm quite happy with this car charger.  It's much faster than the old one I used for an earlier Ericsson CF388.  Quite simply, it does what is supposed to
Good product - the retractable chord feature is great and keeps the car clutter free.  Works well
I've owned and discarded numerous chargers.  This one is great - the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use.  It looks pretty fragile, but so far it's held up to pretty heavy use.  Many of the other chargers I've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection - no such problems with this one
Easy to snap on and it wont come off easy like others.  Protects well and does not hinder any functions
Don't go without an extra cell phone battery.  This is the one you want if you don't like the bulky one
this product needs a better custom fit. It slides around too much it needs a smaller fit it is too big
I have a baby pink Razr, and this skin looks so good over it. Also it really adds grip, so it's not as easy to drop, and the silicone stays warm in cold weather, unlike the bare metal of the razr. I would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr, they are awesome
This cover is great, it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped. It isn't soft leather so if you want to protect your RAZR you might want to consider a shield
I think it will do a good job of protecting my phone in case I drop it
This Razr phone cover is a great product.  Hard shell protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable.  Easy access to side buttons...protection on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover I've seen for this phone....keeps keys and screen open so no dust gets pushed up against them....overall a good product for the money
The cord appeared to be pretty messy. But the product is just fine. 
-Good quality sound.
-Accept/Hang calls.
-Volume control.
I don't think I want more. The connector is a Pop-port connector. It's showed just as big in the product's image. If you have a 2.5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image, then what the h... is wrong with you?
this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky. come with belt clip if u need i
great product, exactly as advertised... thinking about buying a couple more in different color
I am very happy with the phone case, there are alot of cases available, this is by far the best in my opinion
Wow, I have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever. Clear sound-great range-and most of all its gorgeous. Turns heads all over the place. Man I feel high tech with this thing on. I payed $30.00 off of ebay, but that was a rare deal. Still Amazons price cannot be beat. Buy it, youll love it
Got it for 20 bucks on cyber moday. Easy to configure and use. Nice sound quality. Only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly
This is a great product.  It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it.  It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size
Crystal clear sound along with being very comfortable and user friendly make this headset a great cell phone accessory to have!  Love it!!  Amazon's price couldn't be beat.  Very happy with it!
+comfortable
+easy to put on
+fair-to-good sound quality
+full charge lasts approximately 2-3 weeks
+fully compatible with Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR
+nice style with black and "alloy" accents
-some callers claim to hear echoing
-not the best sound quality (I like Logitech better
I had a motorola H300 before... and this is leaps and bounds better. 
The sound quality in both units are great but I'm impressed by the weight of this LG unit. It is like comparing stones to feathers (a bit exagerated but you get the point...). 
This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud, which sits snuggly in my ear. The Motorola unit didn't... which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls. That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my head a bit to keep the unit against my ear. With the new LG, I no longer have to look like I have a stiff neck while I'm driving
 This item came with the other item I ordered at the same time. It's quality is good, but does not stay on the phone, when opened, as well as I would have liked
The title says it all: Fits Great, Great Price! Real leather and fits like a glove
This product is a good deal if you know how to use it. Unfortunately, if you are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider. The Verizon V=cast product would be better because it comes with Headphones. If you already have the headphones (which cost anywhere from $20-$100) than this product will be good for you
It fits great but doesn't cover the corners of the phone... kinda the point of a case.  The seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful.  The bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip you're stuck with it sticking out in your pocket. 
I am using this as a spare, so haven't actually put it in the phone yet.
I will definately take it on vacation with me.
i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me), and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires.  and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40!  so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat, and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing.  the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it, my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device.  i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why.  it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more.  so the connector part could be a little sturdier, that's all
Use it every day, it's a nice connector that does just what it says it does.  As with all Treo/Palm connectors, you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection.  Wiggling the connector where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to work for me
This is the correct cable for the Tungsten E2. It's not listed in the product description but you can find the info on zip-linq's web site. I've had several of these for other devices. Great products
The product works very well, but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone. Overall, I would recommend it if the user pays attention when connecting. Great buy for the price
This is a nice cellphone.  I got it from a local cellphone shop.  Free and only 1 year contract.  Eventually prices will be free like the motorola Razor V3.  Small phone and I like the mp3 player mode :
This is the best phone I have ever had.  Reception is crystal clear, and it is also a mp3 player, with the ablility to add a memory card. Video, and voice recording capabilities, and a 8x zoom camera. And best of all very, very user friendly. 
I was expecting just to save the touch-screen from scratches, but these screens make the touch-screen also "feel" better.
There was no loss of brightness with the screen.
Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough.
Its a pack of 15 screens.  Have been using just the first one for the past three months, and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all I'll need to replace it
This holster holds the V220 securely in place.  The only problem might be that it is hard to pull it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone.
This is a good holster for my V220. It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be, so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is, it adds a little wear to that area. Other than that its a good holster for the price. And thats another one of my problems. I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall, which was highly over priced for my standards. Amazon seems like a great place to buy it, but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories, then you can find a site with free shipping for it, and its 7 bucks. Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks, but with shipping. I trust amazons shipping though. So if you want a functional holster, get this one
I have had this phone (and Virgin Mobile pay as you go service) for only a day or two, but I wanted to write this review before I forget. I'll update it if I change my mind.
Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in, it's a good ride. The phone resembles a small remote control. It's sleek and unassuming. Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screen, but it's a pleasant experience. The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation. 
It's attractive. It works. It seems a real no-brainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service. You can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuff--but you'll have to get used to the funny graphics.
The UI is totally intuitive. You interact with the menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if you've been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences. 
One thing: this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine (thirties). While it's a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing (pay as you go--for me 18c/min), there's a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel. I have Lily Tomlin's operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds; and if I should ever receive a text message, among my canned response options (that come standard with the phone) are "Hell no," "Can't talk," and "Leave me alone."
My friend has had one for a few months and loves his. He makes a good bit more money than I and sports some fancy handheld devices, so it's not just that it's so cheap and cool.
I'm a long-running Virgin customer, but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry, and so I've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier (including non-US). Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.
Let's start with the positives:
-Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.
-For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.
-Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors. 
-Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage). 
-UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.
-Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.
-Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...
-Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).
On the downside:
-Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).
-Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.
-No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.
-No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.
Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that
I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewer--if you want a phone-phone (without all the extra hoopla) this isn't a bad deal.  I "*bought" a red Slice a couple of weeks ago (take note that I'm not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear) and for my needs (emergencies, quick calls to family from the grocery store) it's just right.  
Good points:
I got mine for "*free" with Reward Zone points at Best Buy.
Fits into a small purse or pocket easily.
Nice looking (someone mistook it for a "Chocolate" the other day).
Clear reception (long distance calls are just as crystal as local; not sure if this is an "area" thing, but apparently the service in and around Chicago's solid).
Pay-as-you-go option works well for someone who doesn't spend a lot of time on the phone.
My Slice holds a charge just fine (I've noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem, but so far, so good) and doesn't heat up, as someone else mentioned (maybe that reviewer's got a defective phone or battery?).
Not so good points:
It's so slim my husband has bet me I'll lose the phone within a couple of months (could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk).
Someone else mentioned the odd graphics (hot dog dripping blue sauce, some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth.  Seriously, I have no idea what those things might be), but I say it's workable if you have a sense of humor (:
Yes, the buttons are small.  I have small hands, slender fingers, and I still manage to bump the "3" whenever I'm trying to shut off the phone.
Sometimes it's difficult to turn on (the button doesn't always respond when I push it, though could be I'm a wimp), but once it's on it's fine. I'm thinking this will get broken in with more use.
All in all, it's not a bad phone.  Beautiful red.  I find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty (phone confessions!).
I'm satisfied with mine.  And since I haven't forked out hundreds of dollars--or any dollars, really--I won't feel too guilty when/if I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork! 
I got my Slicer past black Friday for $19 from Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency. The Virgin plan 18 c/min pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they were originally made to do.
First $20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 months (one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active) despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30c/min to Eastern Europe. I used the phone on my business trip to call home. The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phone so far. The Virgin web site is excellent. The account is easy to recharge. They also have planty of ring tones and graphic options 
for downloading (mostly priced about $2 per download).
The phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuff except a camera.
However the memory is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for $19. I am surprised to hear that other people complained about the battery life. My phone holds charge about 3-4 days on stand by. 
The only bad thing I discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone (for example during the flight) I had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again.
I would sincerely recommend the phone and the Virgin pay as you go plan to mature users
As a basic phone, the Slice rates OK. I have only a few minor complaints. 1) When a headset is attached the phone does not ring through the external speaker. So if you are not wearing the headset when a call comes in. The call will be missed. 2) There is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time. It can vibrate or it can ring. 3) The battery life is not as good as stated. In Standby the phone runs out of power after about six hours. 4) With text messaging there is no Reply option. To reply to a text you have to start a new message and then search for the sender of the original message. 5) The ring tones that come with the phone are horrible. Aside from those few problems I have been quite satisfied with the phone
Two week review
I got this phone to use as a phone and am very happy with it. I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review.
First, the qualifier. I have a nice canon camera and don't want to use my phone to take pictures. I don't want to use my phone to listen to music or surf the internet either, I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there. If you are one of those people that has a different agenda for your phone, then this is probably not the phone for you.
The Good
Size is great. This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width, but shorter. It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky.  It makes a razr feel thick, but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvr. 
The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phone. It also has good reception. Sprints network is not the best in my area, but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar.
When I was in the car, the road noise got too loud to hear, but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine, and keep my hands on the wheel. 
Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lot. I expect to spend between $150 and $200 this first year, including the $50 up front for the phone. The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included. Although I haven't tried them, it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level.
Many of the other Virgin phones look like toys. Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it, it also looks like a real piece of equipment. As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP. (in vibrate mode of course) At the same time, my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool.
The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu. What were they smoking when they decided to use a pig for "my account," a dragon for "messaging," etc. Other than that, the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive. 
Can't really comment on reliability on this phone after just two weeks, but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine.
The Bad
Perhaps because they are affordable in other ways, Virgin screws you on ringtones and background. The four ringtones included are unacceptable, and you are blocked from up or down loading your own. They do have a pretty big collection on their website you can get for $2.50 a pop, but none of them sound like a phone.  The included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too, so you are likely to fork out $2.00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well. 
The buttons are a little too small. Most of the time I do fine, but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small. Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I haven't run into that problem any more. 
Battery life has not lived up to what I read, but that might be because of how I use it. If I charge it every night I am fine. I ordered an extra charger to keep in the office and one for the car as well just in case.
Summary
After two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls. It is not big on extras like a camera, but what it does it does well. Virgin uses Sprint's network, see if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a Virgin phone. [...
I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now. I've used it for 3 years and really like it's basic functionality. The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and that's pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have low-battery life. I'm hoping it'll last for 2 more years before I get a new phone to catch up with the modern world
Saves time and $$ up/downloading pics & tunes to/from my phone.
The Speck rubber case is the best case i've found for my Blackberry 7290.  That being said, it's not ideal and i'd make a few changes.
Pros -- protects case well; no screen scratches; minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag; no need to use the belt clip (most women prefer purses/totebags to belt clips!); and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages (no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag). 
Cons -- clear case collects dirt; screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight; screen cover doesn't fit squarely into the rubber case; and screen cover gets scratches on it, making the screen harder to read.  
I get a lot of compliments on this case, it's different enough to be noticed, and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case.  However, because of the cons, I suspect i'll need to replace this case more than once a year.  But i like it enough that i'll pay the $35 to do so.  Maybe the next version will have some improvements.  In the meantime, i feel like i'm getting my money's worth out of it.
I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can "stay in touch", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome!
No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Blackberry Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product. 
A must have for anyone who owns a Blackberry. I also see they have these for the Treos
THIS COVER IS SO HOT I GET TONS OF COMPLEMENTS ON IT IT'S A GREAT COLOR AND THE SCREEN PROTECTOR HELPS A LOT TOO. I WOULD DEFFINETLEY RECOMEND THIS TO ANY ONE
This case is superior. It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed). The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip. It's bulky and impractical. Just a simple tension clip would have been fine
I have had this for 2 months now, and it has worked out well. I use it on my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercise, I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone. When a call comes, the AudiblePlayer pauses, and I can answer the phone with the built-in button. Voice quality is fine on my end (in both ears) and I have received no complaints from the other end, unlike the other reviewer (maybe he got a bad unit, or his stereo connector is dirty?). When the call is over, the AudiblePlayer resumes. I never have to stop my exercise, or even slow down! My only complaint is that the volume control doesn't work worth beans. When you rotate it, at various positions, you will hear from one ear or the other. There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears; but, that is not at the maximum volume. This is a bit annoying, but something I can live with. I just leave it at one position (close to the max volume, but a little less), and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume
It is so flexible and high quality sound/volume control 
Just plug in a headset of your choice and you can:
* listen to music on your Treo 650 
* Headsets sound awesome on it
* It will automatically shut off the music when the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headset still ON
* Has an awesome volume control 
* Works with any headset and you can hear it in BOTH ears by the way
* I keep my headphones on while on treo cell phone calls because it has a BUILT in Mic which is perfect.  no one can even tell I am on a headset
* I have a stressful job and listening to music while I am working in my home office with headset and the ability to pick up calls and leave my headset on with microphone is REALLY GREAT
BUY THIS NOW - your quality of life will increase
I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. I have dropped it many times- still works.  In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants, I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what- IT WORKS.  I am still using it as it works perfectly - even the camera.
I used my sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it.  The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable.  I will be keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives
This Samsung is the most reliable phone I've ever had. I've had it for two years, dropped it NUMEROUS times, and it is still going strong with only a few scratches. The battery life has declined during this period of time, but it still lasts about two days before charging. While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now, I am impressed with how many applications I use daily - alarm clock, scheduler, memo pad, etc. Reception is usually good too. 
In all honesty though, the camera is not terribly great. Pictures tend to have a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry. I still enjoy the camera, if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options (black and white, brightness, flash, etc.) to make pictures look decent. The video option is rather lame though, as the footage is choppy and you can't even transfer or send it to anything.
Recently when I was on a shuttle, two girls, both with Razors, saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well. Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones. I am supposed to be getting a new phone too, but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up. If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone, this is a good one
Almost 2 years ago, my fiance and I signed up for a 2-year contract with Verizon. We got a great deal for both phones. And two years later, both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents. This is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily. I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone. 
Pros:
 - Sturdy: It's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin        phones. I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition. Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone, the battery doesn't detach easily. Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson, the battery would also detach and I'd have to restart my phone.
 - Compact: Though it is on the thicker side, this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it. 
 - Good Buttons: For those who text message a lot, the way the buttons feel can really make a difference. The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting.
 - Menu & short cuts: On the side of the phone, you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow. If you hold #, your phone goes into vibrate mode. If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera & video menu pop up. You can also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press "up," I have mine set on the calendar. 
 - Long battery life: I'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone, but for every day use, this phone is great with respect to its battery life. There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged.
 - Camera has flash & other neat options: You can also adjust the brightness level, have a self timer, take multiple shots, 10 different "fun frames," and 5 different colortones like sepia, monochrome (black & white and negative. 
 - Zoom: You can zoom upto X4. 
 - Phonebook: Contacts are easy to access and it's easy to search for entries. I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one name. You can enter that persons home, mobile, fax, office and pager number. You can also enter an alias and email address. You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups.
 - Voice commands:By pressing & holding the * button, a voice command menu appears. It's a nice feature but is not something I often use.
 - Speed dailing: One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing. It's nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person.
 - Menu styles: There are 2 different menu styles you can use. I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through. My fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design.
 - Custom welcome and goodbye screen.
Cons:
 - Video quality is poor and very pixelated. My phone only holds 2 15-second videos.
 - Despite the generous 15 ring tones, it's hard finding a ringtone that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. Out of the 15 ring tones, there are only about 2 decent ring tones.
 - Antenna: I don't use the antenna very often but when I do, it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy.
 - Picture quality is not the best. If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone.
 - Does not have V-Cast.
 - No MP3 player.
Overall: This cell phone is exactly that, a cell phone to make calls. It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone.
this phone is great. It was my first phone ever and when it came time to get a new one i just couldnt find a phone as great as this one. So if your looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anything cause let me tell you mine went through world war 3 and its still working like new and not to mention the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in time if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect:) i was and still am real pleased with this phone and it is an excellent phone for anyone!!!!!!!!:
If you're hard on your electronics (like I am) this phone is for you. It's practically indestructible. I put mine through the washing cycle (as in washing machine, yes) three times, let it dry overnight, and it still works perfectly. I've also run it through the dryer twice, dropped it countless times, thrown it at a wall, and ran over it on a mountain bike. The camera still works, and I think the reception actually got BETTER after going through the washer. All it has is some scratches on the casing and a bent antenna. This is a perfect phone for a on-the-go, klutzy person
This phone is great!!! I love this phone. I have had no problems with this phone at all. The camera is pretty good, and it's small and cute in size, and it has good reception. I would definitely reccomend this phone!!
This Similar Unit is 1/4th the Cost of the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300, and it is JUST AS GOOD.
Verizon Sells it for $19.99 + Tax
Amazon Vendor Sells it for $.01 + $4.99 Shipping
Bottom line, it is just a Piece of Plastic that gets the Job don
My daugher loves this one
I've had my snap-on case for about a month and I love it. The magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone.The bottom case could fit a little more snugly, but it's not a problem
Fits great My Wife likes the bright color as it is easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone
We got this phone for my sister's new razor. The color and fit were great! I was worried since it was a phone from Altell but it fit like a glove! Thanks
If you have a cell phone, you need a charger.  You don't have to get a car charger, but it's a good idea, if you have a car.  This works well
This is a very nice case. It fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it. I found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit.
A great case that I would highly recommend.  
No comment. Everything is OK !
Regards,
Cristia
It snapped right on, and looks great.  But sometimes it can slip and press the buttons on the side of your phone.  It can either make the phone not work, or run down the battery
First of all fast shipping and second of all what a great product it is! I absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees it! Thanks
Quality of this product was excellent.  I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover.  Would recomment this to anyone.  I have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it.  Only one complaint, the clip is not tight enough on my belt, would recommend a little tighter.  Overall, the best I have ever seen.  The stitches are even and tight, good quality
This case is well equiped the handle wearing it on belt, at worl, plays movies etc. easily access & good looking! It functions at any level. Shop at Amazon for all your Motorola Needs!
The case fits like a glove!  Appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching.  The cover and back were easy to attach and did not scratch my phone, which I checked by removing the case. 
My only complaint was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt. The attachment kept my phone from laying flat.  No problem, if you slide off the back cover, and take off the small foam piece on the inside, you will see a tiny screw.  Just unscrew and remove the mount.  There will be a hole in your cover; if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece. Attach the back cover to the phone and then fill in the hole with a piece of felt.  Looks fantastic. 
If you are a clip user, the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it. But maybe that is a good thing so that it won't fall off accidentally.
I cannot comment on how well the case will wear since I have only had a few days.  
My friends that have seen it love the new look.  I chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone.  Awesome!!
This was a great price for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery. The only thing I don't like is the lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around. All in all this was a great deal
The battery works great and lasts a long time. I'd give it 5 stars if not for the cheezy cover; it falls off sometimes
I like the shape of the plug so that it doesn't cover up any other outlets. It works, what else can I say
This is a great basic cell phone. I bought one and received another as a gift. Unfortunately, I opened both so now I have (2). If anyone needs one for twenty-five plus shipping that has not been registered with Net10 (still has bonus 300 minutes and no number), is new, and has all original accessories (open package); or for ten extra you can get an OEM car charger, leather case, and earphone (all unused), please email movieshop(at)hotmail(dot)com 
I've had TracFone service for 2 days now and glad I switched.  The C139 is small compact and fits in my shirt pocket.  It lacks in ring tones and the address book could be better but for a simple phone, it's all I need. I don't need the internet access and all the other features I end paying for and not using.  TracFone was quick to transfer my phone number which happened in 1 day and they said it would take 7 days. I'm impressed with their service so far. I won't go back to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in on a service agreement for 2 years.  I have good service and will be saving $300+ a year now.  If you want a nice small light and simple phone that all you want to do is make and receive phone calls, this is the one
For the $50 bucks you pay here, you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime.  That's not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere, it would be $20 bucks, and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately $20 some odd bucks or so.  Plus tax. So cost works about to be about the same.  Frankly, I see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere. 
Regarding the sim card, I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion.  A sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD -electro static discharge- just like computer RAM is.  ESD is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed.  I'd bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows.  Before you handle the sim card, you should "ground" yourself by touching something metal.  Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD.
The phone itself is OK.  It's BASIC.  Emphasis on the basic.    I just transferred my mobile # from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139, about the only edge the c139 has over the V120c is the color display.  Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper.  IMO, Motorola could have added a port to accomodate a USB interface to this model.  It was short-sighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c -also in the same price range- has such a port.  
Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time.  I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday (10/28/06) and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone.  Also, it is an entirely new network.  In Southern California, the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular.  
Suffice it to say, I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly, however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesn't recognize my number and to input my voicemail number. And around and around it goes.  I anticipate nothing but problems with "technical support" when I contact them.  They are very polite as customer service reps, however they can barely speak or understand English.  I am envisioning hours of BS with the call I have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever. Note to Tracfone:  Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT.  
Also, I wasn't overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging.  The V120c is actually more intuitive. It's much easier to use.  But the c139 does have one advantage in this regard - text messages cost only 0.3 units versus on the V120c, TracFone was deducting 0.5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message.  I'm not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone.  It should be one uniform deduction across the board.  Consumers should contact TracFone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon.
Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone and wants an *inexpensive* phone with a much easier on the eyes color display.  Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for $20 bucks.  But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper, and a little more flexibility, then get yourself a Nokia 2126. For the same money you spend here, the Nokia is a better phone.  It has a USB port, a speakerphone, plus other extras.  And you probably won't have any trouble setting up the voicemail either.
My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thank you
My tracfone has worked out good so far. Customer service is fine and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use. If you decide to get a tracfone, please email me for a quick referral before activating it- we each will get 100 free minutes from the 'refer a friend' program. I'll also send you the simple instructions to follow. I've used Tracfone for quite a while, so i should be able to answer any questions you might have. 
ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should be able to get us the free minutes

I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great. I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good. I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces. This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good. i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine.
Are we all talking about the same phone here? I haven't had any problems with it and using it is a breaze. I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plan so I wouldn't get stuck with roaming charges while I was away, far from my calling area. My old phone (also an LG) wasn't compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old AT&T service. I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for. I also like the fact that it has a speakerphone. It does not have a camera, and I was not looking for one. I already own three very good stand alone cameras, why bother with another?? I was although a little aggravated having to re-enter all of my old phone book information because that's the only way you can do it. The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic.
After two no-brand aftermarket cables which were invisible to the phone and Nokia Phone Suite, this cable and the included software driver worked perfectly. (Note: Nokia Phone Suite must be separately downloaded, but is free of charge.)
We have uploaded photographs from our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone.
Nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cable. I recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone. Some Motorola phones accept a universal mini-USB cable which I believe is cheaper
The pack is quite as described.  Any one of the three items
might justify the small expense
Good purchase.  Although I have not used the headset yet, the case and charger work perfectly.  Great savings.  Amazon is the place to shop for a discount
Be careful - Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz.  It is not.  Read the 'Vital Statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz.  Check the Sony web page (and other people who sell this phone) and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz.
I don't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy.  I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case - I have no idea if this phone is really good or not
I love this phone.  I can do so much with it.  It is light weight and fun to carry.  I love the button flip feature.  Great phone!!
Purchased this phone a little over a month ago and so far everything works well and have no problems.  Many nice features and the service in the state of GA is good
I bought this phone as part of the Sprint/Nextel SERO plan.
I used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didn't fit my needs for several reasons outlined below:
- Battery life was sporadic -- I got maybe a day worth of power from it. One time it completely discharged overnight. For the price of the phone (and the two year contract it carries) this is a dealbreaker.
- The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area (I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years - so I have some experience with coverage around town). I was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals.
- The phone would sporadically mute the ringer. An incoming call would light up the display but there would be no ringing. This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring.
- For the same monthly service fee, I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet ability. Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen -- but if I'm going to be locked into a 2 year contract I would like to have some fast internet access on the phone. The i880 still uses the slow Nextel data network.
I was not a Direct Connect/Walkie Talkie user. If I were, then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher (since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network). I could not justify being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed sub-par on a network that did not (and likely never will) support the latest high speed technologies.
Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phone:
Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so the micro-SD card is accessible from the outside -- no need to pull the battery to update the card. 
Here's the big things I don't like.
1. You CANNOT use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the micro-sd card as ringtones. 
2. You also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download. Any message (mms) that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper. 
3. Battery life on my phone is flaky - I'm getting maybe a day and one-half with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages.
You must pay Nextel to download ringtones. There are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their micro-SD memory card - however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with.
Note: Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company. If you're making a decision on Sprint vs. Nextel, there are only a couple reasons that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint. First, if the Nextel coverage is better. Second, if you have a need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature.
The Sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications. The Nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrial/construction market. For almost every consumer, the Sprint side is a better deal. Sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives.
Here's my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks:
The Good:
-beautiful speaker phone
-compact design / solid feel
-2 megapixel camera, ability to capture movies
-flip swings open when you push a button
-Nextel sms/mms messages can now be auto-downloaded - I believe this is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature
-nice loud audio
-both Nextel walkie talkie and DirecTalk support
The Bad:
-can't play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other non-Nextel transfer (Note: Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable - but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle)
-Nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier, soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things. While not entirely unexpected, it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to non-construction users (Nextel's core group). If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most Sprint plans which include them. Nextel doesn't have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers. Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens.
-the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to.
-while not phone related, some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals.
-I am only getting about a day of battery life - which is extremely low.
Very well-thought design. I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first. I thought it was weird. But after I looked at the pictures again.. man.. how brilliant! They should've provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on. And the leather is of a very high quality too. The seller is awesome, very Amazon-like shipping (i.e. fast)
This product is definitely worth the $30. The leather is nice and what you can't see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard. When closing the keyboard, the plastic does catch a little, but I think that will go away the more I use it. The phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior. Access to the buttons have been made easy. Each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather. The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating, "ok" and "ptt." The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen. On the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc. Another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clip, however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case. Highly Recommende
I was very happy to see that Amazon shipped me PalmOne brand Stylus's and not some generic.  This is a great deal and I'm going to order some more.  Thank
Does what it needs to... The hell with Palm that changes stylus with every new model
This battery arrived fast, fits, and works well. I highly recommend this seller
Great battery, now the phone goes way longer without needing to be recharged
I ordered this headset in silver - Webtreo sent out white, but said that even though it appears white, it really IS silver! We argued about the color, and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white, silver, red, and black. It took almost a month to get resolved, but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered. It is very small, light, and easy to use. There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit. The headset gets 4 stars, Webtreo only gets 1 star.I wouldn't order any products from them again
This is by far the best bluetooth headset in the market, it is small and very light as well, just like wearing an earing.  The sound is amazingly clear, people on the other end thought I was actually using my phone.  
I have no problem with it falling off, just make sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ear.  I'm so happy with this cutie that I'm buying it for my sisters & friends
Consumer Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as the best. I can hear my callers while driving and they can hear me. The Samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headset, so you won't look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car. 
And if you want to be one of "those" people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places, it's small enough where people will really wonder if you're a crazy person talking to yourself. Gimme a break! The Samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger. This is super handy since the headset is so small and would be easy to lose or damage if not for the sturdy (but not at all bulky) carrying case.
The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headset that I did not quickly return due to poor headset volume. I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my car. I simply could not hear the people to whom I was talking. The Samsung is the first to provide enough volume. I'm still happy with it after two months of ownership.
The Samsung was also approximately $35 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy or other retailers, whether online or in person. So buy it from Amazon's retailers.
The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stay in your ear while running. I learned this one morning when I was late for work and ran from my car to my office. The Samsung quickly began to fall out of my ear.
If the Samsung's short talk time is not a concern for you, then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremely small package
Excellent sound quality.  Noise cancellation really works.  The button on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call.  Very nice.  Works much better and more reliably than ANY BlueTooth set I've tried - and I've tried almost all of them. 
only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easil
I PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS. AND IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.I ALSO WAS VERY PLEASE WITH IT
This case has good quality construction and fits properly. It solves the problem of being able to plug in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case. Two things kept me from rating it 5 stars. I prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses. I also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working. The fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning. This is still the best optional case if you want to use the MP3 player feature and require the use of earphones
  I recently took a chance on this item, and I am happy to report that its not bad!
     I was actually not looking forward to a swivel (bad experience) but the swivel is very solid.
    It looks good. The skin is not the best, but I like it.
    The only problem I have with it is that you have to take out the phone completely in order to use it. 
Works great with my SCH-A950 and BitPim..
It's not rocket science... it works or it doesn't. The device works fine. My only "complaint" is that the cord is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the price. The short cord is the only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating. It's well worth the money
you can tell that the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store.  but it does the job well and i have never had a problem with it
I have nothing but good things to say about this purchase and product.  It works and looks great.  I only wish they could make a PDA phone that wasn't as big as a boat
The battery works very well.  However, the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily
The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster.  How stupid is that?   Why would Samsung supply this type of holster to their customers? 
However, this holster has solved that problem.  You can now flip open your phone when using this holster.  Thank yo
I wasn't expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case, but I'm very impressed.  I bought from accessory one, the total cost was about $4.  The case fits nearly perfectly, every hole is the right size and in the right place, not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case.  Others have complained of chipping paint but in the week I've been using this it hasn't chipped yet.  Can't do any better for the $$$
Very nice, but I don't like the belt clip.  If I remove the belt clip there is still an impediment where it use to be
For the quality and fit of this cover the price is a bargain.  It fits very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grip.  I found the razr v3 to be akward or slippery at times and this cover takes care of that problem.  I would recommend this product highly
If you're looking for a slim cover that won't add a lot of bulk to your RAZR, this one is great. No, it probably WON'T provide much protection if you drop your phone. It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints, and the rubberized material is easy to grip and feels great in your hand. The cutouts for the outside display, camera (I have a V3m), and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well. I don't use the belt clip, as the cover by itself adds hardly any bulk so I just keep my phone in my pocket. Without the belt clip, there is a small 'snap' that sticks out a bit from the back of the cover but it's really no big deal. For the $3, you can't beat this. :-
The battery was everything needed.  No surprises.  It fit the phone and charged fine
I received exactly what I ordered very quickly
Thought I'd post this info here, since this subject still confuses people. I just talked to a cust care representative, who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180-day period will invalidate $250 Amazon phone rebate. 
Well, I guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer, since I don't really need a data plan, and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time. Any comments?
I still would like to give it 5 stars since I believe it is a great product. I'll take one star off however, due for its weak battery life, and lack of standard audio connection (2.5" or 3.5" minijack). 
There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate.  Lots of good features in the 8525.  
My intent is to document some of the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future.  I am a business user who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device. I use a Motorola H700 headset with my old devices and the 8525.
My overall assessment is; Replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I don't think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use.  All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flip phone. 
If readers find that there is a way to perform any of the deficiencies I describe please let me know.  My suggestions in rough order of priority:
1)  Blue tooth headsets. Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting.  To hear my voice commands repeated, I have to turn on the annoying sound of the PDA, so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset, I can hear my voice commands repeated back.  I am referring to the standard voice dial that comes with the 8525.  One quick solution would be to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA.  Even nicer would be an upgrade that allows full audio with the "VoiceCommand" software (this is documented in many other reviews).  Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate.  It changed back to the original audio setting after turning off the BT headset.
1a)  If I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS display the voice dial page.  Instead the initial "Owner Info" page stays up and you can't see the name on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screen.  Not desirable when driving.  If you didn't set the PDA to its annoying noise level you can't hear the name you requested either.
2) Need to be able to control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio, Vibrate or OFF.  For example need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF or vibrate.  
3) Need to be able to program how long the display stays on.  I am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off when I need to see something.  
4) I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if one was available for long drives when my BT headset battery is dead.  Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeway.
5) Provide a built in way to make the PTT and Comm Manager, and IE Quick key buttons programmable.  I would use them for many other functions; such as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker (need to be able to select speaker here see below).
6) Give me a way to press an external button to toggle between speaker on and off.  I can't easily push the speaker icon with my fingers.  Suggestion. Add a radio button on the volume control that allows you to select speaker phone. Yes you can select the phone speaker soft button, but often the display has gone blank and the keypad is showing.  Turning speaker on/off should be easier. 
7) Provide option to save email attachments to storage card.  That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory. 
8) Remember the Filter setting I selected for Tasks.  If I have filtered by a task category during that session remember the filter I selected.   Currently I have so many tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up 
9) Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key (or make this button programmable) I am always having to close the browser because it gets hit/selected
10) Let me Edit/Paste with one step for notes, word, task notes etc.  The IPAQ has "Edit" at the bottom.  With 8525 OS you must select Menu, then Edit, then Copy.  Keep Edit on the bottom. 
Question: is there a key on the keypad to select CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC (the letters are underlined in the menu, but I don't see a CNTRL key on the keypad?
11) Allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the top and then use the nav button to move across the icons (might be the way to allow an external way to set audio volume)
12) If I power off the device have it remember my input selection.  For example I select "Letter Recognizer".  But I must reset each time I power 8525 off.  
I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do. However eventually i found out that the phone part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone. My friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking. The phone ear-volume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places.
Pros:
Software : The windows applications - Word, Excel, Media player. 
           Plus : Ability to create office documents and play games 
Hardware : Micro sd slot - Sandisk card cost me 20 bucks.
Wireless Internet : You could connect this device to any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet. I dont have a data plan with Cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my WIFI home network. If iam at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free.
Cons :
* A bit bulky to carry around.
* Camera is not as expected. The view finder is sloppy and cannot capture images in low light.
* Battery needs to be charged every second day (depends on usage) but even with light use i had to charge it every other day.
Best suitable for :
* Internet savvy people who are on the move.
* Email and messaging.
* As a pocket PC.
* To listen to music (need to purchase micro-sd card)
Accessories:
Boxwave leather case ($30)
Leather case by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device. The only problem is that after you put this case on, the phone volume needs to be set to the max, even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well. But the boxwaver case could be opened half way and folded over.
Bluetooth
This device works very well with blue tooth.
Bottom line:
If you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you. 
This is a wonderful device. Build quality is typical of HTC, meaning very good. The call quality is good provided you're in a decent service area (system not overloaded with AMR-HR kicking in). The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable. The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback. There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult (this is perhaps the ultimate "geek" phone). The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools. There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile, but IMHO it's not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be. In general, things work as they are supposed to with this phone.
One drawback is that while the device does support the Bluetooth A2DP profile (stereo bluetooth sound), the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible. The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono, which means you'll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth. The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality, which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve. And even after all of that, there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio. In other words, don't waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously. However, the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular (mono/one ear) BT headsets (I recommend the Jawbone), and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable.
Another audio related drawback of this device: There is not even a 2.5mm stereo jack. The only physical audio out is through HTC's proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack. The saving grace here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable, and also the availability of HTC-to-3.5mm jack adapters on the market.
Even with a few shortcomings, I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market. It packs an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor. If you're in need of a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices, this is your phone
Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed.  I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several  years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professional-by-day \ GadgetFreak-by-night guy.
If you don't read anything else in my review please understand this:
1)  This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump.
2)  If you are NOT in the market for spending around $110 a month for a service plan (voice and data), you have no business with this phone.
This is a productiviy enhancer, it is not %100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day, this phone does the trick.
The battery life isn't that bad as I have this thing in its cradle (not included) during the day.
Screen is bright.
The WiFi feature works beautifully.
The 3G network is amazingly fast.
Works flawlessly with my Exchange 2003 server.  (Active Sync is so easy to setup, a noob could do it.)
The only reason reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it can't make me a cocktail
This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia (it's quite popular in Singapore), and the HTC TyTN in Europe, but in an unlocked model. and quite a bit more expensive than what Cingular sells it for here.  If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product, you will think it's a heavy, over feature laden product that you will never fully use, and its a problematic one at that.  Having said that, this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today.  The features of this phone (3.5G, Bluetooth 2.0, etc. ) are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with you.  You can even install Skype Mobile on this phone.  The keyboard stows away well, and has good feel.
There were initial problems with this phone in the Asian market, that have now been since resolved, and is now robust and reliable.
But one caveat to keep in mind when using this product...it runs Windows Mobile.  Meaning, if you are not familiar with Windows devices, it may frustrate you...it doesn't respond like a non Windows cell phone.  But, if you can overlook that, it will perform better than anything available...even Blackberry devices do not compare to this
Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brand-new 3G/Wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone.  The 3G and Wi-fi works very well in our area.  It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service.  E-mail and internet works very well in both locations.  Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues, since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette, and use a card reader and USB cable for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips.  The color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone.  Again, 1GB allow you to take a very long video in Windows Media Player format.  Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails, contacts, and calendar any time, any place, and automatically chime schedule notices. The only drawback are the battery life, which require frequent charges, slow keypad for phone calls (and I do not know how to silence the keypad), and a little tough keyboard touch.  Lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult (especially shift+A !).  In addition, Microsoft Word processing is slow, and so as Excel, which will require a faster chip. Overall, a great all-around pocket PC in this generation
I bought my 8525 when they first came out, like two months ago right after christmas
I upgraded to a 2gig memory card and also have the GPS service
I love my phone though it might have problems time to time and some getting used to
Overall this was the best purchase for the price, I ended up spending  almost $900
but I also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and some other features
This is the best phone out. period.
no the iPhone isn't going to beat it
the iPhone doesn't have a slide out keyboard
that's soemthing I don't want to part with
I would like to see the iPhones operating system though!
but the 8525 takes home the trophy!!!
Hi, I just recently purchased this phone. and so far these are the problems. Yes you do have to restart the device, it does get hung, but i don't blame the phone, after all it has windows mobile 5 in it. The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week, So be careful. This phone is pretty close to being perfect. Other than the fact that it has windows, The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have. If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities, Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature.. which in return will give u a nice thick bill.. Once you buy the phone i suggest that  you get this software Spb Pocket plus. It helps shutting down softwares running in the background, and adds more features. The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features. It can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once. Overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware. the one star missing is cause it has Windows. Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too.
Battery came quickly and performs as describe
I bought this cable knowing by reading the reviews that it might not work, so for the price I gave it a shot. This USB cable was a replacement for my other cable that was used as a chew toy by my dog. Since I already had DataPilot (susteen) software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computer with the phone attached it saw it as a (susteen USB cable) and installed all the drivers on winXP, if you don't have susteen drivers/software you can obtain the drivers for the USB cable for your phone from their website (free download). I never used the installation CD that came with this USB cable and I installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes it also works with the DataPilot software, but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830
My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thank you. 
I've had my Tracfone for about 5 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems. Tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. My email is debsclay@gmail.com 
thank you
Very good phone.  Nice color screen.  Easy to read. Lots of features
My experience using the TracFone has been good. Coverage and connections are not a problem
Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things.  This is one better as it has a pen built in.  Just unscrew the tip of the stylus and you've got a pen.  You never know when you'll need one, so when you do there it is.  It also blends in well with the design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactile-ly.  Good stuff
The product came promptly and I am happy with the quality.  However fitment wasn't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo.  Not a huge problem, but something I would feel everytime I reach for the stylus. But the pen works pretty good, and it feels sturdy in my hands.  I would definately recomment this product to others
This is the original and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy.  Fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the V188
ROI is great.  Working very nice for me.  Been using this for the past 2 months.  Fried my original one when used it abroad, with wrong voltage
Excellent price for the charger. Original Motorola equipment.  Shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item.  Shipping was very fast.  I definetly will continue to do business with Amazon and A1 Accessories. Very pleasant and uneventful shopping experience
Kind of difficult to place without getting some kind of stuff between the screen and the protector. Does what it is supposed to do
The price is good and the cable is working well. I had a very good experience with this cable.
I recently bought a Nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones.  However the Nokia CA-53 cable was around 50 dollars.  This was a great alternative.  So far everything that I have used it for is working flawlessly.  I would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the CA-53
This product helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone.I love it to death and use it almost everyday.Eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them
Works fine. Difficult to connect but connects securely. Comes with an unlabeled cd (couldn't tell one side from the other) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers, though the tones aren't labeled in any helpful way. I was impressed. It also has links to any 1st party software you need though I'm sure a Google search would be just as easy
I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect.  The belt clip is very strong, making accidental unclipping rare. The pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts.  The front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets.  The bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the Chocolate's "End" button.  This allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case.  The only dislike I have is the name "Cellnet" embossed on the front flap, but this is not really a big deal.  I would recommend this case to anyone who owns a Chocolate
I've had this case for under a month, but it's working great.  When I first got the case, I thought I was going to have to send it back because I thought it was too small for my phone(I have an LG CU500 from Cingular.).  It was a pretty tight fit, but it worked.  The case has since seemed to stretch a little  so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out
The computer recognizes my phone when I  plug it in, but the drivers on the provided CD are pretty much worthless. 
I needed a Razr Car Charger, and the Crystal Clear Hard Shell Case was included with the purchase.  I did not think I would even use it, but I love it!  It is light weight, easy to clip onto my jeans, and does a great job of protecting my Razr phone!
Cheap. Simple. Good looking.
The only thing missing is a belt clip.  There are stick on belt clips that work fine with this
prompt delivery
excellent quality
a nice bonus - hard shell case! that doesn't ruin Razr's stylish look a single bit
Products exceeded my expectations.  The charger wasn't very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable.  I wasn't interested in the case, but after I got it, I found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal.
This is a nice cellphone.  I got it from a local cellphone shop.  Free and only 1 year contract.  Eventually prices will be free like the motorola Razor V3.  Small phone and I like the mp3 player mode :
This is the best phone I have ever had.  Reception is crystal clear, and it is also a mp3 player, with the ablility to add a memory card. Video, and voice recording capabilities, and a 8x zoom camera. And best of all very, very user friendly. 
I've had this phone for a week. I'm using it with T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary. In my opinion, it's a feature-packed phone at a reasonable price (for an unlocked smart phone, at least). 
The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well, although I did experience some lags and software freezes (with third-party apps). Fixing it was a matter of rebooting. I think the menu organization could be smarter, but you can customize much of it. 
I do love that the default screen displays your day's calendar agenda. But that screen hides the main menu. Not a huge drawback, but it confused me at first.
Photos with the 3-megapixel camera are grainy (it also has a VGA camera). Since this is a phone first, and not a camera, there is also no stabilization control. It does, however, come with a flash.  
Sound quality of phone calls is okay. Your friends, family and colleagues will hear you clearly. On your end, however, it will sound like you're talking on a cell phone. It's not bad, but I've had conversations on better sounding phones.  
I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet (WLAN) access. It's possible to set a default access point. The problem is that if you aren't at that location regularly, you will have to search for a new network. One way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider. I agree, however that some kind of one-button auto-detect would be ideal. 
I don't like the SIM card slot. The metal cover pops off fairly easily -- as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first. 
The phone's slider form factor moves smoothly, perhaps too much so. By default, sliding the phone completely open -- something that's hard, but not impossible to do accidentally -- unlocks the keypad.  
The N-80 is also bit awkward. It feels thick for lack of a better word. Its 5-way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than you'd probably expect. 
Another drawback: no QWERTY keyboard. You can connect to a wireless one via Bluetooth. But that assumes you want to carry a keyboard. The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible. When enabled, it works contextually: on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs.
Overall, I give this phone high marks for features, but a few annoyances mean it's far from The Perfect Phone
I got this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back. Just right off the box, the phone is quite impressive. Many complain about the response time - yes, this phone is slow but doesn't bother me - far better than my windows machine  Overall, very good phone for what it offers. 
Pros:
*	This phone tops in ergonomics, ease of use, presentation, features, Bluetooth, speakerphone and call quality. 
*	Wi-fi is worth mentioning separately. It is simply superb.
*	Nokia's connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market. It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots of money. I accidentally downloaded a big chunk of data and going to pay through my nose next month!
*	All the apps that come with this phone are quite good. 
*	BT sync with my apple is just fine with iSync. Also I transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable from my Wintel. The phone automatically toggles to "Mass storage" mode when it is connected to PC, which is pretty neat. 
*	I haven't faced any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily. I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 2-3 days, good enough for my call volumes. 
*	Symbian browser is fast and stunning. Bookmarks feature is neat. Having the wi-fi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while you're at home and then use it wisely while you are away. 
*	Camera quality is good. Dual camera is just a great idea. Camera settings are similar to professional cameras - very very impressive!
*	Tried the video mode and came fine. 
*	Battery life, as many claim, seems short - but I charge my gadgets daily - so not a big issue
*	The headset that comes with the phone is really good. 
*	Tonnes of themes, apps etc available for this phone..... 
Cons
*	My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed. It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I "selected" an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left. It is SO frustrating.
*	My second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on, the screen light does not come up. So you won't know - even in the day - which button to press to answer the question "Unlock phone?" - you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain. 
*	The process of taking a picture sucks. The picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get. There is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final image. I sincerely hope if there would be some s/w patch for this. I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras - with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i. That is one far superior camera quality I saw so far.
*	Slider lock and unlock feature is good and bad. I am putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket, the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing. So you would need a small app to do the locking properly.
Overall - good phone. At this point, Nokia has better phones like N95 etc - of course very expensive.
I think this is going to be a very good phone, but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800.00 + dollars.
well I called NokiaUSA direct and regular retail from them is 499.00
all day as many as you want, so it should be considerably less on Amazon.
you would think ?
I guess not !
I recieved good customer service and excellent help from these guys.  Thanks for allowing me to keep this phone with my network.  I have so many acessories for this phone. I didn't want to give it up just yet, and you allowed me to get another phone just like the one I had.  Thanks. 
My V180 is through Cingular - I never have a dropped call and reception is excellent. Long Battery life, very easy menus/wayfinding and small size. No frills like MP3 player or camera however - just a very good phone
I've had this phone for a year and a half with no problems.  It is good for making calls which is really all I ask for from a phone.  It is easy enough to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and they've had no problems.  My carrier is Cingular and I've had excellent service in the NY tri-state area and because it is a quad-band phone, I've also been able to use it while roaming internationally.  Battery life is just okay (not as good as my old Nokia)...I have to recharge every other day with normal use.  Overall, it's lasted me long enough that I would call it a good value.   
If you're the type of person that doesn't spend HOURS on the phone, and want a good basic phone, this phone is for you. I bought this phone in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks, and it works great. I would say that the only gripe about this phone in the US is the price, I wouldn't pay over 40 bucks for it. It's a nice BASIC phone. The screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones.
I must admit, I was skeptical about this package. It didn't seem possible that the stuff would actually work for such a low price. Even though shipping was steep, it was still worth the money. The case fits great, and it hasn't cracked at all.  Both chargers work great! I think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it, but I can't complain! I would highly recommend this package. The chargers aren't high quality, but they work
incredible price for all three items. just for the car charger alone, verizon wanted $24.00. the plastic cover for the phone is very good as the razr phone scratches pretty easily
This 3 Piece Combo is a good purchase.  The chargers might feel a little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality.  For the price,  you can not beat it
Helps reduce clutter, and now I can actually close my cup holder tray (Acura RDX)
This charger is awesome.  It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended, it doesn't get in the way like the spiral cords do.  The cord is thin, not bulky.  I never measured the cord when extended, but it is much longer than most
This car charger is amazing for the price. You go to your service provider store and buy a car charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better. The retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular, or sprint stores.
I've had it for about 2 months and I am still happy with it.  It has a little blue led light that comes on when the car is on, which is pretty bright, and could get annoying to some people, but I like it. 
as advertised, on-time...   i've used for two months and it works great...   i'd buy from this outfit again..
I like the way it doesn't take up space in the console when I am not using it and it seems to charge the L6 just fine! No complaints with the devise or the service from Amazon
I'm happy I receive my cable. It fast service. I'll still keep buying from this seller. thank
ive had this charger for the last couple of months, and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it. It is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone
Car charger serves it purpose, it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter.  The design is basic with no hidden features.  You just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way.  
I would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device.  Otherwise a perfect gift!
Excellent qaulity for price. Divers easy to loa
This product has worked great.  The cord is a little short, but have had no functionality issues. 
This was an excellant purchase.  It was exactly what I needed and works as well as one that would have cost me $20 or more in the stores
Not much to say about a battery.  I installed it - it works fine
I purchased this battery becuase my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of service,so it was time. It does last longer and Im glad I bought this battery. I have no bad reviews about this so if you have an audiovox 8910 cell phone and you need an replacement,this is the one.But you decid
This battery performs as expected.
It is the standard Palm battery - meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device. Note also that when using Bluetooth and/or the Blackberry Rim email service battery life is notably reduced.
The solution would be lower device consumption, or a bigger capacity battery - neither of which appear possible at the moment.
So my solution was to have a second spare battery
This product far exceeded my expectations.  It installed very easily with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first day.  It has far out performed and put to shame the more expensive bulkier unit it replaced.  This navigation system is truly a useful tool when traveling in areas you are not familiar with
This is a wonderful cover for your blackberry.
Very sturdy and easy to use. Love it!
I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell, and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch.  It was a great investment.  The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use.  Cosemetically, it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing!  The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards!  This is an excellent product
I used to forget my wallet but I always had my blackberry so I bought this then since I take my phone every where but not my wallet This salved the problem. This is good for people who forget their wallet or phone but remember to bring the other
I love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one. It is just nice to have to keep up with one less thing. I highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff
These are well worth the money for your Nextel Phone!  Although it may not list it, from Experience, these batteries fit 95% of all the Nextel phones.  Take a look at your phone battery to see if it's the same shape.  The color will be different as these have a white cover.  
They are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store.  Plus these were NEVER used before!  Unlike the celluar store battery, these batteries come in a box, with the battery in shrink wrap, so you know the battery has not been used.  When you buy then in the cellular store, they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed (and you'd never know it) plus there is no shrink wrap!  Ever buy a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months?  Hmmm, I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one?  Would you know????
These batteries are well worth it!  Buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days
This charger works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack.  It is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone
This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery.  However, it seems expensive for what you get, not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable.  Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time, save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price...and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges
i couldn't believe how small it is compare to the pictures i saw online. however, one bad thing about that is that i lost it already. now i have to think about buying another one. anyways, it's a cool headset. i would recommand it to anyone who's thinking about buying one.
When I lost my Stylus I had a difficult time finding a replacement. The others I tried weren't the same. These are.
Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phone models: A630, A850, A950, A970, A930, A990, A645, and A870. The thin adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office
I originally bought another Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one. I returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better! It actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer. It's a great product for a great price! Delivery was quick too.
This product is great.  It fits like a glove and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases
Pros:
Fits the phone very snuggly.  Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer.  All buttons of the phone are accessible through the case.  The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and easily remove and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of your waist.
Cons:
You cannot access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case.  The clear plastic screen that covers the phone's screen is a little to far from the surface of the phone's screen.  This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen.  The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but I'm not sure.  
On the positive side, you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online.
Picture quality sucks for the price. Colors are way freaky. The screen is perfect for text but not for pictures. Viewing pictures on this is terrible. Keyboard is ackward at first. The manual needs to be much more detailed. Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots. I expected to use it like a typical pilot, where you write on the screen. This feature is not implemented.  Overall, this is a very good phone. Good reception, great sound quality!! Speakerphone is great! Neat features. Worth the $$
The Treo600 has all the functions I needed -- phone, calendar, camera, etc.  Two shortcomings: 
1) the screen is not good for viewing pictures, but that's what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo650
2) the phone failed to dial two times in two months.  I had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem
   It's a very nice phone!!!!!!
This is a good, thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen. I don't foresee it peeling...ever. It has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare, but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on. I've washed mine, it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky. Just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place. It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bend it, IT WILL NEVER GO BACK. So be extra careful
Durable, thick, doesn't interfere in any way with the touch screen. I haven't had to wash it yet so I haven't tried out that feature. But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these it's been totally worth it to me (hey, after spending hundreds on your Treo what's a few dollars?)
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.
I had it up and running in minutes with my LG VX-8600 (Verizon).  I downloaded BitPM free software to use with the cable.  I just followed the installation instructions that came on the CD that comes with the cable.
I clicked on "discover phone" in BitPM to have it automatically find the phone.  (I didn't even need to go and look for the com port as the installation says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phone)
Note..
When installing, make sure you pick the right driver.. if you have XP, choose the XP driver, not the NT, or Win98 or other driver.  It's part of the file name..look for XP in the driver file name.  
Received exactly as stated. My only complaint is in the description- they don't state the length of the cable. My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly. I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire, as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall. I projected the cable to be about 6 feet, and if you do yourself, you're in for a surprise. This cable is only about 3 feet long, otherwise everything is fine. One last thing...The description doesn't state this but, the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models, which really helped me.
On a better note, shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated
I have a VX9900 enV and this cable works great with it in conjunction with BitPIM.  Not much to say about it really, it does what it should
got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great, drivers work and everything! awesome deal for 3 bucks :
Works well. Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install. No synchronization software is included so you have to use a third-party tool like bitpim. Which is ok
I ordered this cable on December 1st, got it on the 8th. Very quick.  Brand new.  It came with drivers but I didn't need it because I found drivers online.  The cable fit perfectly with my LGVX9900, and to my surprise it charges too.  I use it to put ringtones on it for free :
I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525, and have had a few problems w/it.  First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt.  Second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest, so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge, I guess I've been really rough on my phone), but I just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge).  But the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it.  When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip, instead I recieved a full refund, so that was a pleasant suprise.  I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone
The K790a is currently the best "Cybershot" camera phone in Sony Ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the U.S. today.  It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones.
In summary, this is a great camera.  Oh, the phone functions are fine, too.  Reception is pretty good on the T-Mobile + Cingular networks (used by Speak Out Wireless).  Voice is clear and loud.  Really good.  5 stars
Great device.  Pictures are amazing for a phone!  MP3 player could use a little help.  Screen is beautiful, and as always menu interface is a treat.  The phone is Java 2 compliant however many programs that run in the background will not notify be able to notify you unless the program is open.  i.e... Mig33.  Very other than the MP3 player, and Java notification issues the phone is a 5
purchased the phone about 3 months, like the nice QVGA screen, and impressed with excellent cam (it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors)
the phone has good reception, at least on par with W810
voice call is OK, but as other users stated, the level is kinda low (esp speakerphone), firmware upgrade (R1KC001) will help
the operation is standard SE style, if you are familiar, you'll be OK without reading manual
the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio (still used by BBC), and it works well with T-Mobile internet; it can play local mp3 (VBR supported), wma, asf audio (rename the extension to .wma), realaudio; but I wish it supports ogg vorbis, which is the audio format I use
bluetooth works pretty well, it works with ALL bt equipment I have (including wireless headphones)
logitech headphones users please read: in order to make the headphones works properly, you need to go to bt menu, and connect from there
web browser can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html, and wap sites
the phone is kinda bulky, and a bulge on cam cover, but it's pretty comfortable and firm to hold, making messaging is a good pleasure
though the phone has lot of functions/features are pretty appealing, it lacks something it's supposed to have:
quad-band, this is not acceptable for this price, even many lower models have quad-band (K550, W610, W580, W810, Z710, W710)
music player should have more file format support: ogg vorbis, streamimg wma/asf, shoutcast
m2 memory card, though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB, PSP card is a lot cheaper
pro:
QVGA screen, and it shows clock when the phone is idle
wireless headphones support
3mpx cam with auto-focus and xenon flash
comfortable and firm to hold
con:
low earpiece and speakerphone level (though firmware upgrade will fix)
tri-band
cam cover bulge
conclusion: if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam, go for it, however, if you travel a lot, settle with quad-band models (they're cheaper
I've had 3 cell phones prior to this one, all Motorola and I really thought they were all pretty good phones...
However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water! It's very compact and durable you can tell it was made with an incredible level of quality control. I don't think I'll ever go back to Motorola.
The camera is a great feature. This is why I bought the phone, now I am never without a camera. The flash is good and strong, so it takes great pictures with good focus.
I don't really use the mp3 feature because I have an iPod. I will not comment on this feature. However I was VERY disappointed that it wouldn't allow me to use mp3s as ringtones. I heard this was because my service provider is a jackass and not the phone's fault though. With a little bit of forum browsing I was able to hack my way around this (if you have this problem email me at skibum2801@yahoo.com)... now I have my very own custom ringtones that come out as clear as day with the nice speaker.
Call clarity is MUCH better than my other phones. I feel as if I'm simply using my home phone it's so great.
The screen resolution is absolutely beautiful. The buttons took a little bit to get used to (because I was a Motorola girl for so long) but I picked it up quickly and now I have no issues.
[...
This is a great phone. Pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carrier. Bit pricey but worth it. Great camera and interface. Super easy to upload pictures straight to Flickr via phone.
This is a top selling handset in Europe - but tricky to get hold of in the US which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology
Coming from a SonyEricsson T637, I was familiar with the SE UI so getting used to this phone was relatively easy for me. I love the camera, it takes amazing pictures and the music player serves my needs just fine. Support for a memory card is a huge plus (I have a 1 GB Sandisk M2 Micro card) and now I never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos. This phone also allows for extensive customization in terms of shortcuts and themes, ringtones, and so forth, which is another plus. As far as negatives for the phone, I only have a few minor ones: the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet, and the camera lens cover sometimes slides open in my pocket, but neither of these would convince me not to get this amazing phone, it's quite possibly the single best phone I've ever owned! Definitely very happy with this purchase
Es el mejro celular q pude encontrar tar pasar 2 meses leyendo Reviews en mil paginas... 3.mp  un screen de colores hermosos , radio , videos, movies, mp3, bluettoth , memory card, buenos acesesorios incluidos,  Es el mejor celular del mercad
Pros:
 - best pictures yet (3.2 mega pixels) on a cell phone that I have used 
 - built in flash (rare for cell cameras)
 - cover over lens on camera
 - good music player
 - expandable memory with Sony M2 flash memory
 - fm radio 
 - bluetooth works great
 - screen has great size and wonderful resolution
 - EDGE device makes internet data fairly quick and usable as PC modem (via bluetooth)
Cons:
 - keys are small and difficult to press
 - camera lens cover needs a lock switch (mine opens just walking around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket) - very annoying
 - sleep timer is a bit quick and should be adjustable
 - I shouldn't expect it thinner since it is the size of a very small digital camera but I'd still like it slimmer. 
this phone has all the feature that i wanted. The camera takes really good picture.  Better than all the phone i've seen so far.  The xenon flash really helps taking night pictures.  I use to own the w800i and this one takes way better pictures.  It has auto-focus and other several fucntion that i haven't used yet.  The mp3 player is also very useful.  I love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phone.  It also very easy to navigate through the phone functions.  My computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded.  it's just like plugging in a flash drive.  The screen is very bright and clear.  The screen resolution is decent.  It's very easy to customize also.  I dl program online to customize the theme.  The battery lasted a lot longer than i expected. Usually last around 3-4 days.
The only complains i have about this phone is the headphones.  Walkman series have way better headphones so when you get this make sure to buy new headphones and adapter.  Another complain is the expensive memory stick micros.  I couldn't use the memory from my w800i phone. and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned.  It has also replaced my camera, and I am now never without a camera.
I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited.  They don't give the phone a second glance, not realizing it's got the 3.2 megapixel capability.  I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows.
After throwing in a 1GB memory stick (I think it was $79?) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300+ pics right now.
The movie function rocks too, however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject.  The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though, so at least concert videos make for good listening.
The phone works flawlessly with my PC.  If I throw it on the USB cable, it pops up instantly as another drive, just like the camera.  Just drag on/off the music and pics.  All pics are very nicely numbered and named.
If I don't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone, I don't even take it out of my pocket.  The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around.
Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem, which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program.
In terms of being a phone, yeah it's great.  The contact list is easy to work with, the call clarity is no issue at all, good signal, no dropped calls, etc. etc. (this is all with Cingular).  Speaker phone works well.
It needs charging about every 3rd day, charges very quickly.  Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges.  
The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge, it only wants to charge it to 89%.  If I want 100% I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes.
I paid 1/4 as much for this product and it works just as well as the name brand product
The product was delivered in a timely manner and functions properly
The photo of this Premiun Side case is not at the Photo. The side case in the photo have a Treo Logo and the producto don't have i
  I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car.  The clip just wouldn't grip my belt securely enough.  I gave up after the 3rd time my Treo 650 hit the concrete.  Most of the time I just slip the thing in my left pocket, but that doesn't work so well with some pants - especially jeans.  
  I decided to try the Treo leather case and I like it quite a bit.  The clip is strong and I find it easy to get the phone in and out of the case. 
This is the third case I tried for my Treo 650, and it's simplicity is it's key to success.  My first case had a flapping piece of leather that cost $35 and was totally useless.  My second "skin" had a belt clip that whenever I bent over (to tie my shoes, for example) the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor!  Simply bad design. 
This well designed Premium Side Case is easy to use, easy to wear and gives excellent protection.  When the phone is in vibrate mode, you are always aware when you get a call, page or email.  It's small enough that it's not a problem when worn with a suit, and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt.  Good design is always fashionable and the case is well made.  I wish it came in brown, I'd buy a second!
So if you're looking for the right case... this is it.  You will not be disappointed.
I used to carry my Treo 600 with the original case that came with the device. But soon, I found out that the original case is kind of loose and my Treo fell out from it once. Luckily, it was on a carpet so no damage (at least no visual damage). After that incident, I started looking for a better case, and this one is what I found.
What can I say, you don't know how bulky Treo is until you wear one on your belt. The case does its job - it provide a nice and secure protection for Treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway so you don't have to carry it around with your hand or in you pocket (which barely fit). But Treo is quite heavy and it's thick, so you will definitely aware your Treo is hanging on your belt. And sometime, I just feel like it's too much a burden and I want to get it off me. But overall, I still prefer to have this than the original case. And, the heaviness is not this case's fault, should blame Handspring (now PalmOne) for not making it lighter... :-
This case is great for protecting my Treo, but the downside is that I have to remove it from the case to use it.
I purchased it because I had actually dropped my Treo when walking with it balanced on my portfolio, now I clip it to the  portfolio and it is secure and safe, and I don't run the risk of leaving it behind
It is great! you have to buy it, believe me. Don't waste your time looking for another case, this is the best
How come phone accessories don't qualify for prime shipping? How are they different from other electronics
This case does what it is supposed to do... it protects your palm treo phone.  It is very nice looking and durable.  The only negative comment that I will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit.  That is why I gave it a 4/5.  Amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price
Fits nicely onto the Kensington power block. The fit is snug and secure enough not to fall off and get lost
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  
As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow
Driver install was easy and Bitpim access works just fine.  The cable I received also charges the phone (VX8300 from Verizon).  
I agree with previous reviewers (Gely + ZenCity) regarding this cable.  The price was right, set up was easy, and (with the Bitpim program) you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently.  I loaded my whole Outlook calendar and contacts into the phone, as well as some songs, wallpapers, and ringtones.  Don't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from Verizon's sites (VCast and such); just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music/tones that you already own
This is not an "all-in-one" package.  This is JUST the cable and driver.  You will likely need some type of additional software to actually DO anything with the phone.  Check out a freeware program bitpim for that.  I have a VX8300.  The cable works.  The driver works.  Bitpim works
I ordered this cable (two of them actually) to use on the LG 8300.  The driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300.  Once loaded, it found the phone easily.  I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.  
The price of the cable was excellent.  I was unable to locate a data cable locally and was happy to find one on Amazon, even though it was only available through a third party.  All in all, I recommend the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300.  For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to be no driver included for your phone.
It worked well with my vx8300. However I already had a driver that I knew worked so I did not use the disc. So I cannot comment on the driver disc
Product is excellent and does all it is supposed to do
I was very pleased when I got this cell phone case. I was really frustrated with my phone before purchasing this case. I kept on getting the screens dirty every time I made a call. Guess I have oily ears or something. No worries now that I have this case.
The things I like about this case:
1.I think it looks cool -- which ... ok does mean something to me.
2.It feels good - it has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth
3. It protects my phone - I have two boys and while they are supposed to not touch "dads phone" it has an almost 100% chance of getting dropped sooner or later. 
4. Its not bulky.
5. Fits the phone 95% perfect.
The things I don't like:
1.Like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the camera a little but not a big deal, camera is not so hot anyhow.
2. Earphone spot is awkward. Functional but not perfect.
So the GOOD far far outwieghs the bad.  I have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best
Got this a couple weeks ago. The rubber suit covers every bit of the phone so I am confident that I won't be getting any scratched. And it flips open a ok. You can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched. You can't access the TF card.
There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isn't going to fall out.
3 minor qualms: The see through plastic has a little glare on it, especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suit. Also, it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock. (noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt). Last, the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the camera. You already know the v710's camera is crap for its specs, but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap. I got used to it real quick
I just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice. It feels solid and professionally made, not some cheap "import special". I like the blue LED light instead of the typical red dot.
Also, the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging.
The IC chip is important so that you don't overcharge your phone battery and shorten it's life.
I would buy again. Great price for a quality charger.
The only problem is that it can only hold the standard battery so your out of luck if you're using the extended battery for your A920 phone. An e-mail to Krusell confirmed this. Other than that, it's a very nice and stylish case for the Samsung A920 phone
top part of telephone gets loose very often, elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily
I have a 6255i phone and used the cable to connect to a windows XP home system.  The shippment came extremely quick.  Installation was seemless and the drivers from XP worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately.  Downloaded the Nokie suite software from the Nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine.  Cellphone companies wanted 50 bucks for the same cable.  Use this one you will save money and its the same cable
I purchased the cable for my Nokia 6255i. The cable came faster than expected (I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow). The cable came with the software driver (although I did not need it) and worked great with my already installed Nokia Sync software. Electro Island had the best price by far and the service was excellent. I would definitely use them again
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  
As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow
Bluetooth cannot be accessed when the phone is in the pouch.
Phone cannot not be charged while in the pouch.
I was so easy and fast to order and the person I bought it from seemed to make it easier. I have had no problems with charger and am very happy with my purchase. I would definitly buy again
This cable saves me a lot of money. I don't need to buy stuff online when now I can download it straight to my PC. makes it easy to transfer Pictures, videos, ring tones, contact numbers. It is great to put things on and off. Also great for keeping a back up
My original charger broke that caome wit the cell phone. I was going to go buy a charger but they cost like $30 if you get the name brand. This one I purchased does the trick and saved me lots of money
I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand charger I got with the phone.  While it does charge, I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98%.  I am unsure, however, if this is because my battery is less effective than when new.  But, all said, it serves its purpose
This holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with the phone. 
It has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt.
It is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holster. The thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy in/out. The phone clips in solidly and doesn't fall out
This item cost 1 penny (of course the shipping was $4.84), but I thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores.  I've had it for two weeks, and it hasn't broken yet; nor has it dropped the phone accidentally.  Can't go wrong with the price.  Order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters
This belt clip was exactly what I was looking for and the price was great.
product functions well, and looks good.
If I could change one thing, the swivel action is just a little looser than I would like, but definatly not a problem
I've had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now and I just love it! I am very new to all this fancy cell phone stuff, the last one I had was bare bones basic. It is great having a phone that you can do so much with. The camera is so handy since I never remember to take my other camera anywhere with me and the mp3 player and radio are also great to have. The music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it, I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadn't made up my mind until I saw this phone and what an awesome deal it was. You just can't beat a one cent phone with free shipping and $75.00 in rebates! T-Mobile had my old Net10 phone number ported to the new phone in 2 days! The customer service people have been so nice and the ability to buy ringtones, wall paper and myfaves icons right on the phone from T-Zones is awesome. I also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account & plan info right on the phone. I am very impressed. The only issue I have been having is finding accessories for it-my usual discount accessory shops don't have much yet-I'm assuming because the phone is so new, but I'm sure that will get resolved soon. Buy this phone, it is great
yes, it's a tie with the Sony Cybershot K790a for the best multimedia phone so far on the market (at least until the iPhone will show up, then the game is on again). i am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile contract for 2 more years and get this phone for $100 or drop my previous one and get a new contract..
I highly recommend this bundle for the price.  For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travel charger, you get a travel charger, home charger and a USB cable with driver CD.  Everything works just fine.  The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking, so here are my suggestions:  you can use Windows Media Player to move music over to your phone using the Sync feature, and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file transfers between your PC and phone. 
Some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine, but they were unable to get the data cable to work. However, I found no such problems, and successfully used the data cable to transfer files off of my phone. After installing the drivers, just search the web for a program called BitPim. It's not exactly the nicest looking software, but gets the job done.
I got the a data transfer cable , the house and car charge cheaper than what I would have paid for the car charger alone.  You can't beat this price
Dear all
I have been using this piece for the last one year and its quite a decent one.It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed. 
An ample speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handy at times.
MP3 player is so gud...but had to purchase an addition mem card.
I recently had a problem with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by T mobile..which makes it trust at ruining times..
Thanks for tmobile and amazon...
Hope this help
If you want a cell phone that is well made, looks good, feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the V360 is an excellent choice.  It has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that I don't want.  it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use
I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlocked/unbranded and it was of the quad-band variety.  Here's my take:
PROS:
-Durability; this thing was built with the clumsy in mind (like me).  I must have dropped this thing a dozen times and there's barely a scratch.
-MP3 player; I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke, but with the cost of TranshFlash memory coming down (I bought my 512MB chip on eBay for $7.99) then upgrading is easy and affordable.  That being said, the MP3 player is a feature you will actually USE, and the sound quality is good.  I've had no problem with playing my iTunes music (as long as they're mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality then it will play fine.) **Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats - you need to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either program to rip to mp3 format (you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menu)
-Programmable "smart keys"; I read where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side, it was the camera icon button on the front keypad.  He must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the "Personalize" menu. Not only that, but you can rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps.  It's a handy little feature.
-Built in Bluetooth and EDGE technology.  You may not use these features out-of-the box, but they're for the time when these technologies are more commonplace.  I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files (mp3's, pics, etc) to my phone with my laptop.
-Quad-Band World Phone capable.  This phone works on 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 GSM networks (although that has not been personally tested).  However, I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and I'll know for certain by then.
CONS:
-There's a slight delay when you answer a call - I usually have to say "hello" 2-3 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak.  I don't know if this is a carrier problem or the phone.  (I use Cingular prepaid).
-The light stays on while charging (even when the phone is powered off).  It's annoying.
-The onboard memory is a joke.  You really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone.
-It has a monochrome outer display (full color inside).  This doesn't bother me at all, but it's not as flashy as Razr or other phones.
OVERALL:
This is a great, durable little phone with handy features I think people will actually use.  I've read where people complain about the picture quality - but that's what a digital camera is for.  If you want a good quality cell phone that's well designed, user friendly, and doesn't look like a tricked-out teenager's phone, then this is the phone for you.
As usual, Motorola provides simple to use, reliable equipment but this is not all, it's more than free, you get 50 bucks out of this deal.
This is a good solid phone so far.  Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual.  My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory.  Despite having something like five Meg of memory on the phone and a Micro SD memory card, that's it.  The size of the text message doesn't seem to matter
This is a great phone that I've used for a year now.  I'd like to highlight the standout features that make this phone unique, especially at its price.
MP3 player.  Just get an adapter for the usb port (a few bucks on eBay) and you can plug in your stereo headphones.  Too bad they haven't offered an update to the Motorola Digital Audio Player.
MicroSD slot.  You can take a MicroSD card, put it into the included adapter and plug into an SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s (you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtone, cropping it will make it more effective), 3GP videos (animation looks great, but the sound was slightly out of sync, search the web for video converters to convert your content), or pictures.  I love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them.
Bluetooth.  I got an Explorer 320 headset for $20 and it works great with it.
Battery.  Easily exchangeable.  Easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one.  The battery life isn't very long, so it's good to have a spare battery, they're cheap.
Video camera. Not high quality video, but its something the old RAZR couldn't do.
Customization.  I love customization.  You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone, the two on the top of the keypad, and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone.  It even has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features.  You can easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper.  Also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique.
Speakerphone.  Works even when closed.  Good for using automated phone menu systems and when you're put on hold.  The speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s.  The plastic may resonate at certain sounds though.
Vibrating alert.  VIBE THEN RING!  Why doesn't every phone have this??  It should be the default standard for all phones.  The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket.  If you are one to show off your ringtone, let it move onto ring, otherwise be descreet and answer immediately.
-----------------------------------------------------------
As for what I don't like.  I don't care much for the Motorola menu style.  I prefer Sanyo and Samsung interfaces.  The menu is the same as a RAZR or SLVR.  All the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off.  I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit.  I scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldn't look half worn off.
-----------------------------------------------------------
All the great features is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509 or other more expensive phones.  This phone just has all the fee-free features you could want
I purchased this for 24.99 and that was a steal ! 
Pros :-
Clear voice clarity.
Nice Signals
Easy set up and sync with the phone
runs on NIMH batteries.
Cons:-
Not a good range.if the cell is in my back pocket jean, the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up
    I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headset and find it more than adequate. For the price, it is worth every penny. The ability of using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect. Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick. Once they finally die, your headset is useless. Too expensive to send away to repair. So you throw your headset and charger away and buy a new one. That is good for a company but not for you.
   Depending on your ear structure the fit can be either formfitting or loose. From reading the other reviews here one can infer this. For me it is formfitting. Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or device it pairs to would make a difference in performance. Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static. For me and others, we experienced no such problem. 
   Best bet is to check the return policy if you find that it doesn't meet your standards. But if it works for your device, you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talk time on 1 AAA Alkaline battery!. And you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea. If it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner
The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)
I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.
The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear.
It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery.
The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.
Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.
This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them. I use rechargeable NiMH AAA's, and they just last a really long time with this unit
I bought this headset for internet chats with my husband, when he travels for business. I find it comfortable to wear and easy to use.  The sound quality is good, volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo.
I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a charger. All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies. (Even rechargeables do not last forever.) 
The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear. It would be nice if it bent for a custom fit, but I am pretty happy with it
I purchased this headset (...)and the key features I like are as follows:
1. AAA Battery - no charging!
2. Easy to pair with my phone (Motorola SLVR L7 - European Version)
3. No static on both ends.
4. Have not had a complaint about "echoes" as other reviews stated.
5. Price - affordable but acts like an expensive headset.
6. Volume is good.
7. Fits well, does not feel lose.
8. 22 Hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced.
I am very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best. Customer Service is as good as the product. There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest. Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price. The rating should be a 10
This charger is an excellent value. It works beautifully with my Treo 700p smartphone. I love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button, making the whole unit quick and easy to store. The only complaint I've heard is that the large, blue power light is too bright at night. It doesn't annoy me, but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down, so the blue glow doesn't shine up into her eyes. No problem
Very nice product. The retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone. My complaint with all Palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connector and they break. But the price on this one is good enough that you should buy 2.
I have tried them all.  These are the best.  No more tangled cords.  I only look for Cellet when I need a charger.  I have delt with cell phones for over 10yrs.  Why pay $26 for a tangled mess
This is an excellent product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hiding its style. I chose Treo because of its unique look and excellent features however, the case from Palm didn't work for me because I use the phone a lot and I dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime.  So, it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it.  I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phone while in it, it hides the Treo's real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag.  This one seems to even enhance the Treo's style
I loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands!! anyone, who are crazy over that color!
excellent people to work with.had a return and they replaced it ,no questions asked
Good battery life (certainly much better than the old one it replaced).  For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original.  However it doesn't fit quite as snugly in the dock-style charger that came with my phone (not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone, but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly).  That is a little annoying that it tends to fall out -- if I'm not paying attention I'll wake up the next morning and my phone won't actually have been charged -- but it still works
This battery saved me from renewing the contract,thus the battery was a contract killer.I thought I was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49.99 at the Verizon dealer. But you guys saved the da
The product is probably a decent product, but it doesn't work in my vehicle, '04 Jetta.  I think it has to do with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to long
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised, charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving
I received this very quickly. I couldn't believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price. Very pleased
once again thanks to amazon for this.great product at great price.moreover very reliable..
It worked great just like i excpected. Everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase
The cable is exactly what I needed, and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives. Drivers provided on the accompanying CD worked but were not as complete as I would have liked. I am still very satisfied, as it was only the cable that I was really after, especially for the price at which I bought it
The vehicle phone charger I received was not the one pictured as for sale.  It does, however, appear to be equal in features.  I trust it will function as described.  
__________________________________
I have now used this product and find that it does not work to charge my V170 cell phone.  The car's power outlet does work.  I have since purchased the Motorola charger - more expensive - and it works perfectly.  I should have done this in the first place
This car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right
You might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind. I am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if I know what I am getting is not just a counterfeit. I think I got my money's worth
After reading reviews here & "user forum's" I decided to purchase this 
Desktop Charging Station. 
It can charge a secondary battery in the rear compartment AND can charge
the extended life batteries as well while the Q is on the charger.
The "three color" LED indicator is added benefit, w/a simple guide 
that is located underneath the unit.
The charger can not "over-charge" the battery which is an added benefit.
And, you can easily access the Q while on the charger for SMS texts, using any app., or even using the speaker phone while on the desktop charger
Motorola should include this with each Motorola Q phone as standard equipment.  This should not be an add-on
Great product - works quickly when charging my Moto V555 in the car.  Highly recommend it
I simply wanted a data cable to connect my Verizon cell phone to my Macintosh so I could transfer and synchronize data. Verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on Windows machines. This thrifty cable (&lt; $10) worked perfectly. With the Mac-friendly DataPilot software
This was a WHOLE lot cheaper than the Verizon dealer wanted for this product.  My only disappointment was that it didn't have clear instructions, which was LG's fault
cover fits great and for the price i could not find anything better, was at the local mall and saw a cover that was the same for around $17. i would recommend this case
I just bought this case a few weeks ago, and it's holding up very well. It hasn't broken or scratched yet. Plus, it makes my phone looks a lot better. Well I hope this thing will last for many months down the tough road. Ciao
I would like to buy two or more shells, do you offer differents colors to choose from? wich colors are there? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee. Please answere ASAP
the case looks great, and it is very slim fitting so the phone doesnt look bulk
This was delivered as an OEM product exactly as expected.  It came on time, and was very reasonably priced.  I will do business with Webtreo again
Very good clip-type phone holder.  Came as advertised and quickly.
I bought one of these extended batteries on e-bay and was really sorry.  It didn't hold a charge.  I was reluctant to try again, but I was glad I did.  This time I got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery
I am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life. I had to charge my old battery everyday. I only have to charge the new battery every 2 - 3 days
This product is great... I'm glad it came with the cloth, too
I have tried a dozen screen guards, some of them shine a lot, some of them are not as clear as they promise, some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble. This makes its way through all that problems. Well on the other hand it does have a catch
1. Finger print magnet
2. The price - THAT PRICE FOR ONE!!!
And yea the best part is its static not gum, and its washable.
The touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice. The onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen (easier sad than done). If anything does attach, it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer
But it does have some faults. I have had it for some time now, I got it for my 11th birthday. I have reviewed the cingular version too, even though mines verizon.
FAULTS:
Very short battery life - I have to charge it almost every day!
Camera - The picture you take can't move or it comes out all messed up.
GOOD PARTS:
Big screen - Easy to read!
Recording videos - Even though you get 15 seconds, I still use that to make funny videos with my friends.
It's style - I love the color and style! My friends are all jealous.
Overall, I think it's a great phone
Personally, I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its "functionality" you are buying the wrong phone.  I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not be as small, light, and attractive as Motorola phones, LG phones are built to last. However, if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carry in your purse/pocket and to use just as a nice looking phone, this is a great one to own.
I previously had the LG VX9800 before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c.  I had the VX9800 because when I was in college I would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes.  That phone was incredible.  However, now that I am in the working world and basically only use my phone to call people, I wanted a phone that was easier to carry around and was "cute".  Enter the Razr.  I don't recommend this phone if your phone is your life--it doesn't do much.  However, if you are just going to be using it to make calls and send the occasional text, it's wonderful.  The pink color that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeous--it's almost a purpley-pinkish lavendar color.  In my opinion, this pink is prettier than the T-Mobile magenta and much much much nicer than the Cingular pink (I am not a fan of that one at all).
In essence, if you're looking for a high-tech phone, this is not it.  If you're looking for a lightweight, attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting, this is a great buy
I just got my pink razr phone and I love it so far. i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones. Even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you can see it ,still it works well. I was scared to buy this phone because I read some of the reviews and some of them weren't saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it. Great job motorola keep up the good work
Much longer lasting than the standard battery.  Fast shipping
When I first got my Motorola Q I was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying battery in mid day.  With some setting changes and the 1700 mAh battery that is now far in the past.  For the price, it is an excellent deal.
Ji
A little fatter than the regular battery which means a very tight squeeze in my Q-holder but the extra power makes a big difference
This item is very excellent. I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protector only, but also a squeegeem, cloth and cleaning instructions. This shield fits very nicely over my phone screen
My friend from HK just got this phone and ask me to buy her an Eforcity screen protector.  She loves it!!
Younger brother just got the verizon chocolate.  He's been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up.  Its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but I digress. The screen protect works as described, it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator.  The film has some kind of electrostatic polymer, there's no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen.  Squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed.  
I would recommend
I like this case very much for my Blackberry.  It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when I'm using it as a phone.  It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse.  My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases.  (Come on guys!  Women use these items too!)  Also, the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that I've had this case.  Other than those two things, this is a great, not bulky case. 
it is small and compact, easy for travel but also good for home use
I am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone...I would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed..
I use my belt holster with all the phones i've owned, my i530 is no
exception. This belt holster feels really well made, it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard I use it. A big plus is that I can use my phone while it's in the holster
works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate and can be used to adapt your lg phone to what ever you wan
An extra Lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone. The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts.  It saves time and one last thing to worry about. The charge itself is fast too..
I have found the 750 mah Lithium Ion Battery to be dependable nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging.  It doesn't weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range. 
However, the first time you charge or recharge your Lithium battery is the most important charge of all.  You must let the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery.  The "deader" the battery on it's first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come.
Highly recommended
I love my Nextel i530.  Purchased it almost a year ago now.  I am in northern Ohio and travel many places around the state.  No matter where I have gone, and I take my phone everywhere with me, I have yet to find a place where my phone doesn't have Nextel service.  Also, very durable phone.  I live on a farm here, and we use the two-way often to communicate.  My phone in particular has been dropped several times, once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below, and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud.  Still works like new.  I am extremely happy with Nextel's service and phones.  I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also can't complain.  I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon, Alltel, Cingular, and Sprint.  Other companies have such cheap phones it seems.  It's a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged - from my experience with Sprint, they are terrible with no service anywhere, and their phones suck too
I have used the i530 for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit, or with NEXTEL's service.  To simplify your reading, here is a list of pros and cons.
Cons:  A little chunky; Lacks up to date features and tech (such as color screen, external display, etc.); Battery life is nothing to write home about.
Pros:  Durability (been dropped off a roof, still going strong); Looks (yellow model); Call quality is excellent; Good speakerphone; Digital 2-way is a great feature.
Overall, I am very satisfied with my i530.  The only issue among the cons that is of any real concern is the battery life, but this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones - perhaps due to the nature of the iDEN network on which they operate.  Even after two years, my original battery lasts more than a day with moderate use.  A pain?  Slightly, but given the advantages of NEXTEL, its worth remembering to charge up more often.  Please beware of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below - my experience with their coverage, customer service, etc. has been very positive.  Just make sure you do your homework with respect to coverage before you sign up with any wireless company.  Go with the one that gives the best coverage in the areas in which you live, work, or travel.  It's always best to actually put the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone.  Some providers are overly optimistic.  NEXTEL's maps are pretty legit, at least as far as I have discovered
	For two years now I have not had any problems with my Motorola i530 cell phone, which is serviced by Telus-Nextel.  Over all I would rate the service as good, not excellent.  Rarely I will have trouble getting service in a area where I would normally get a strong signal.  This problem will normally last for roughly under a minute before my phone is once again operational.  I'm a daily commuter  between Canada and the United States.  My phone doesn't miss a beat, it will automatically switch from Telus a Canadian server to Nextel an American server and still have the same great reception.  
	The cell phone itself is big, bulky, heavy, and ugly.  It does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or video features.  It does have a direct connect feature so you can use your phone like a walky-talky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone.  That is neat and fun.  The reception on the phone is clear and crisp, it will seldom cut out of the conversation.  Therefore I did not expect the quality of the sound of down loaded music to be so poor.
	What is most impressive is the phones durability.  This cell phone can really take a beating.  I have dropped my phone numerous times.  I have thrown my phone across a room to a friend who failed to catch it more then once.  One of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces.  On a road trip, my phone had fallen off my lap, out of the car and sat on the side of the road for three days in the rain.  I finally backtracked and relocated my phone.  I had recharged the phone and it worked as expected.  My phone has never let me down, I have always gotten service, and the battery has not died on me thus far.  The battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderate usage.
	If you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishment and do not desire all of those new phone gimmicks this phone is for you.
i have this nextel it works verry good im verry happy with it
What can I say?  It works very well - I keep this in my car so when I travel I don't have to worry about my Palm TX's batteries
This is the 5th Palm treo case I have bought in the last few years, and it is the best by far.  It holds the treo snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap.  The clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot.  It is slim and works great
I'm very happy with this case.  I was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my Treo 700p, but would allow complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it.  In other words, I didn't want something that was attached to the Treo permanently.  This did the trick.  It's simple, but looks good.  Seems to be solidly made as well
Great phone ... durable and so far dependable.  I did buy a larger battery.  There is one complaint, sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk.  I don't know if it is the service or the phone
I have the i850, but the i560 is what my wife has been using for about 3 months.  The phone is so good, my 2 year old can't destroy it! (he's tried)  There's only 3 things I don't like about it: it doesn't have a very big screen, the external screen isn't color, and it has no camera.  Other than that it's pretty much the same as the higher priced models like the i850... and holding them together I suspect that they in fact have the same electronics inside, minus the 3 things I mentioned above.  If you don't take pic's this really is the phone for you!  You can even submerge this thing in water, and it will still work without needing anything special!  It has GPS built in, and all the java apps.  It's everything the higher priced models have minus the camera and a smaller screen.  Even though the screen is smaller, it's color, and very legible
The Motorola i560 is nicely sized, easy to use, and indestructible.  These features are what to look for when looking for a new cell phone.  Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones, such as the i710, but it is the unbreakable model with outside display.  This is something new for the unbreakable model.
Size is important, especially with Nextel, because most of their early models are very big and awkward, like the i710.  The i560 is perfectly in between massive and tiny.  This is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas.  It is equipped with gripping as well which helps when it comes to using the direct connect, placing calls, and receiving calls.  The i710 has a very smooth exterior.  It is nice looking, but is harder to keep in your hand.  More damage is done to the i710 because there is no gripping.  If, however, the i560 does slip out of your hands, don't worry.  Dropping this phone is not a concern due to extreme durability.  If you are worried about scratching the outside, get a leather or plastic cover for it.
The ease of use between the i560 and the i710 is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicity; however, the big difference is in the outside display on the i560.  Without even opening the phone, you can place a call by pushing the stop butt at the top of the phone and scroll through your most recent calls.  This is a safe feature to use in the car.  Speaker phone clarity improved for the i560.  The i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word, where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspect, but an improvement is better than nothing.  
Durability for a cell phone is essential.  There is nothing worse than having to take a cell phone in for repair, or even worse, having to replace it.  As much use as most people get out of their cell phones, how it stands up to daily wear and tear is vital to satisfaction with a phone.  The i560 is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel, and is exceptionally tough.  When the i710 is dropped, it often goes to a blank screen and causes problems with reception and service.  The i560 is completely opposite.  
Overall performance, mass, and resilience of the i560 surpasses the i710.  When compared, the i560 is a better choice.
My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with Cingular, so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do.  Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons so far (after a week).
PROS (in order of coolness, best first):
1. Nextel's Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear.  
2. Any call, either DirectConnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed.  You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them.  
3. If you're concerned about radio (RF) radiation - and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore, this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you (and improves the transmission).  
4. The speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be, even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system (very impressive). There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone (full duplex).  You can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to. 
5. The phone is a little wider than some phones (like the V60), but is very light.  Yet the phone meets the tough Military specs.
6. Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my medium-sized hand. Phone has slight hourglass shape (wider at the bottom) to fit nicely into the hand.
7. Charger charges the battery FAST...MUCH faster than my V60 ever charged.
8. Phone has all the standard stuff I love and couldn't live without: voice dialing, custom rings for calls from my contact list, handsfree, long recent calls list (up to 20), ability to store number to Contacts from recent calls (without having to key the number, just have to enter the name). 
CONS (in order of annoyance, worst first):
1. The phone is almost completely made of plastic, and I've never thought plastic was as durable as metal. While Motorola makes truly awesome phones, I worry there might be an over-reliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone.
2. When the phone is in the holster, the outside display is not visible, forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see who's calling (for those that don't have a custom ring configured) or to check the time.  Very annoying, as I'm used to using my phone as a watch.
3. The icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons.  The only two parts that are clear: the battery (important) and date/time.
4. The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone (where you connect the charger, etc) make me think that someday I'm going to look down there and find it missing. It's easy enough to pop off, but sometimes takes "persuading" to put back and have it cover the slot completely (because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec).
OVERALL, I really like the phone and highly recommend it to all
The cover design is well made based on the requirements. The problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides. In my opinion, compared to all other covers, this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the case
I've had the battery for about a week now. Simply love it. I'm a heavy user of GPS Applications and Power Vision for web-surfing on the go. I used to charge the phone twice a day, now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even forget to plug it in at night and I still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day. Even when i forget to charge it hasn't died on me.
This is a great deal at $16 + shipping vs. the one sold at Sprint stores for around $60
I'm very happy with this purchase overall.  This battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone. Talk time and internet time are increased greatly.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast.  Though that is still better than the original battery.  It may just be the phone. I have no idea if it is as good as the one Sprint sells for 60 dollars.  It is definitely worth 20 bucks all day long
I just bought this battery at a Sprint Customer Service store, and I paid $64.64 with tax in California. I can buy 4 of these batteries here at Amazon. I'm going to return it today, and buy it online here. Should have checked first.
This battery is as good as they say it is. I have not ran out of power yet. 
Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900, making it less high-maintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing, headset using, and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time.  Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind.  It's been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars.  What!?  Aside from the piddling cost of this battery (which is about double the tax you'd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership), there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside.  To me, this is not insignificant, but is ignorable, as it doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing, talking, or using the buttons
The only complaint I had about my a900 was the battery life.  I am on conference calls a lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly.  With this extended battery I am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly.  Totally worth the $15, plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping
The Samsung A900 is a great phone - a Motorola Razr on steroids. (That is, it's much more durable than the Razr.) 
BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL!!!  You literally have to charge this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time.
NOT ANY MORE!  The Bargaincell price was so low, I was skeptical.   PERISH THE THOUGHT!  I got the battery on time; it was VERY well packaged.  It fit the phone PERFECTLY, as did the COVER it came with.
I plugged it in and let it charge completely.  I then used the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge!  WHOO HOO!!!!  BRAVO BARGAINCELL!
BY THE WAY - Even though this is a somewhat "thick" battery, it is  SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE: It does NOT add the "bulk" you might think, looking at its picture.  In fact, I think the phone actually looks BETTER with the larger battery.  I have a leather Bytech carry case designed for the Razr/A900.  It's a tight fit now, but I'm sure the case will stretch much like a new shoe does after it's been worn a few days.
DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY ONE OF THESE BATTERIES!!
The samsung A900 Blade is an excellent phone. I can say so many good things about it. The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid battery life. And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint. Nobody wants to charge their phone between 2-4 times a day. With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times. But that's what you get with a razor thin phone. So of course I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial. This battery is a life saver. Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found, and I did extensive searching. Also this one comes with the door which is very crucial. I've seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door. You would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery. What would you do, put a rubber band around it? Heck no. Well anyway, now that I have this battery, my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries. My A-900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little. Don't worry, you're phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all it's features without dying
I initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained about,until I applied the FIX: Palm has identified that the Treo 680 device can experience reduced battery life when the camera is used. The camera may continue to draw power from the battery when the device is in standby mode. Treo 680 users should install the Treo 680 Camera Update to address this issue.[...
I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months (Including, Cingular HTC 8125, and Nokia E62)  and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned.   The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system ( albeit, less powerful) and much more customizable and synchronization-friendly than the Symbian OS.  Its great for easy installation of software.
Pros:
- Very customizable interface, making the phone very user friendly. You can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button. 
- Palm OS is easy to use, and thus, you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone, unlike Windows Mobile, which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS, but cumbersome and difficult to use at times. 
- You can use this as a one handed phone...very important for people like me who like to drive and text/email. 
- Perfect size, weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear. 
The lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement.
-  Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop 
- Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you, which is very useful  (although limits battery life) 
Cons:
- Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones.  I have to charge my phone every night, and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet, 30 minutes of mp3 player, autoretrieve email every 30 min,  and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions.    If you have it set on auto-retrieve for your email, the battery life seems to decrease impressively.    The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently.
- You cant plug in your own headsets into the device ( like your iPod headphones)  you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm. I hate that. 
I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm, instead of from Cingular.  I got it for 350$  with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included. Also,  if you get it from Cingular, they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone.  
OVERALL:  extremely satisfied with this easy to use, highly customizable, powerful smartphone, despite a somewhat shorter battery life. 
I had a Palm TX which I loved, but didn't like having to go to WiFi sites for the web. I also had a Moto V557 phone which is the best cell phone I've ever owned.  I purchased the Treo for the best of both worlds.
I like the Treo 680, but I had to read all of the instructions, call customer service and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone.  For example, I had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button. (Which I usually missed while in a rush to answer the phone.)
I like the web because it's fast enough that I don't miss the WiFi.  I had to get used to the fact that many web sites aren't small enough for the phone, but it's excellent for using Google maps, looking up business and giving the number for easy dial (just tap the blue line), checking bank accounts, online orders, movies, weather and especially the news.  Email is good too with the Palm software. I didn't use Express or GetGood email.  I absolutely love the chat setting on the messaging.
Now, the phone is another story. I miss the ease of dialing a traditional cell.  My Bluetooth does not work well with the 680. People typically tell me that they can't hear me so I now use a corded ear bud.  The Bluetooth doesn't work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately.  You can't insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions.  There is no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial a number.  You have to leave the phone dialing page and return to redial.  The phone dials slowly if there are other programs running. And lastly, you can't check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone. You have to hang up with the person, unlock the phone, check the calendar and call them back.
The battery life is poor, but I keep a charger in the car which helps a great deal.
All in all, I love my Treo 680. I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommend. They are: Launcher X(excellent), Mobil Write, Treo Voice Dialing, The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows.
I also recommend that you keep you Treo locked with a security password.  I have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this $400 phone
When I first got my phone, I was quite excited.  It had more memory than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated.  From my research, I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours.
1)I had to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th.  This patch can be found on Palm support site.
2) I needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours.
Once I did these two things, my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge, and I've set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive.  This is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive.
I've had no problems with any of my SD cards or mini-SD cards.  The increase internal memory also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo.  I've heard the various complaints, but you have to work through some of them.  it is a great phone
Upgrading from the Treo 650, it is true that there isn't much new. Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and non-megapixel camera leave one frustrated. But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market, particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee.
So I accept the current Palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries. Not elegant, but it works. That doesn't mean that I won't tell Palm "Guys get your act together and come out with something far better!
I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didn't want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear. I took a chance on this headset even though I read a review saying that it didn't sync up well with the VX8300. I couldn't be more happy. Even though it is small(about 1-1/2") the buttons are still large enough to use with ease. It also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works well with my VX8300.
the headset is great, works really well with my samsung phone...the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear, but its really great and i would buy it agai
Well I read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here, but I decided to take the plunge and go for it.  Well I'm glad I did.  All I can say is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the get-go.  It has its flaws but what phone doesn't?  The question is whether you're going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you.  Most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me.  Let's talk about the pros and cons:
Pros:
1. Call quality is excellent. No static what so ever.  No dropped calls.  My area has good T-mobile coverage so I can't complain.  As a phone it does what it's supposed to do.  Make good quality calls.  It also pairs with my bluetooth headset (Plantronics 510) really well.  Speaker phone is of good quality too.
2. Internet works great. I have the $5.99 plan and yes EDGE isn't the fastest but it gets the job done.  It doesn't matter where I'm at I can check my email, finds restaurants or directions, or just surf the web when I'm bored.  It really came in handy when I was out on vacation and lost.  WiFi works well too.  Didn't want to fork out the money for hotspots though.
3. The camera at 1.3 megapixels is decent quality.  No it's not going to replace my regular camera but I found it really handy when I forgot to take my camera to my friend's wedding, but was still able to take quality pictures.  I haven't tried videos yet though.
4. Mp3/Video player: Now the speakers on this phone aren't the greatest so I wouldn't use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headset it sounds pretty good.  I bought a 2GB microSD card bought here at Amazon and now I can hold a ton music and movies.  Videos looks pretty nice I'd have to admit.  This thing is my travelinig entertainment center.  I even found a way to play original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying Mike Tyson's Punchout like back in the old days.
5. Calendar/schedule: I had a PDA but for some reason I'm more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedule on this thing than I did with my Pocket PC.  Probably because of convenience reasons.
6. Smartphone applications: I'm in the medical field and I keep all my medical applications on this phone.  I can quickly look up drug references or research diseases.  I really thought I'd need a touchscreen in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus, I don't find that it's all that necessary and still navigate pretty well. I just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps, but it's more than adequate. And I'm not sure why people don't think there are a lot of programs for the smartphone.  Programs written for WM5 are compatable with PPC as well as smartphones equally. [...].
7. Appearance: Everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do I.  It looks great and feels great.  I saw this side by side with the Motorola Q and the Q just looked so much bulkier and...well... not as nice.  The rubber backing feels awesome.
8. Battery: For all that I use this phone for it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spare which is all I can really ask for.  I wouldn't go 2 days without charging the battery though. You should charge it every night.
Cons:
1. Windows Mobile 5: Mighty Microsoft needs to write a cleaner program. However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will be free to download for T-Mobile customer soon so hopefully that'll take care of some of the problems.  I swear just to turn on the bluetooth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate WM5.
2. Volume strip: Yeah like everyone says it sucks.  I disabled mine.  Adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best.  Luckily my music/video programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume so it's not such an issue for me.
3. Alarm clock: Now I don't use this all that much but I see what everyone says about it and yeah it's a pretty idiotic written program.  However rather than writing half a page on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now goes on.
Summary: So I use this device to make quality phone calls, surf the web, check email, play games, listen to music, watch movies, monitor my schedule, check my medical references, and take decent quality pictures.  All this thing needs now is a laser beam that will cut through metal and it'd be the greatest gadget known to man
I was carrying a PDA and a Razr cell phone. When I got this phone I gave my PDA to my brother and my Razr to my daughter. I love the full contact list with addresses, all the phone numbers and notes that are in my Outlook and it syncs with Outlook. The calendar is really nice and that too syncs with Outlook. I don't try to use it for browsing the internet, but I do use T-mobiles T-zones to collect all my email from all my various email address types. It took some learning to find the easiest way to get to everything, but it's there is you look, called and received numbers with one key press, extremely easy contact look up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a push or two away. It has EVERYTHING that any cell phone has and works as well or better and easier. The speaker phone is great and one touch (or speed) dialing is great. I can store hundreds of phone numbers at numbers I choose, then use the spot number to make a call instead of looking up numbers (ie: Lee's cell is spot 5, home spot 15, office spot 25) I found a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phone. Coverage with T-mobile is as good as any. Some areas I have service where friends with other providers don't and some areas they have service I don't. All in all, I find that I have service across the country without much trouble and I drive. If you have T-mobile cell service, their t-zones for email and many other internet based services is only $5 and WiFi service is only $20 (monthly), can't beat that. The full keyboard makes text messaging and keeping notes MUCH easier and more fun. It's not a full PDA, but it does everything I did with my PDA. It's way more than a phone, really small and thin, easy to carry, easy to lock and unlock the keyboard. It takes nice pictures for emergencies if I don't have my camera and it uses a mini SD card, which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos. Personally, I can't think of a negative thing about it. It's not a laptop computer, but I think it's the best cell phone on the market. My cousin has the blackberry and he's jealous of me and my Dash
I've had multiple PDA's that have crashed and multiple phones in the past.  I had a great Nokia phone, but wanted to combine into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago.  So far, I've had no issues with service.  Been able to make and receive phone calls, call clarity is excellent and with TMobile, I have service in my office unlike other co-workers phones.  Everyone is jealous - their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking.  I really enjoy having the email and internet feature.  The only issue I've had at all is with the volume control - when I'm surfing the net or playing ball breaker, I hold the phone and often hit the volume control.  Everything else works as described and I'm very happy with my choice.
When I was looking to combine my phones, I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews, I picked this one.  I'm very happy I did.
[...
This is my first SmartPhone and I've had a lot of fun with it so far.  For being so small, the keys are remarkably easy to use.  I often connect it to my laptop via a USB cable.  If you have Windows XP along with MS ActiveSync 4.2.0, your PC/laptop will recognize it as a network device.  A little bonus app on the Dash lets you share the Internet connection (granted you have the data plan) at no extra cost.
If you get the add-on micro SD card (about $80), you'll have no need to buy an iPod.  Windows Media Player (which comes standard) works just as well.
It has a built in 802.11b (or g?) card.  When I'm in range of wi-fi, I can use Skype and save my minutes.  I hope T-Mobile doesn't read this since they'll probably patch that loophole :)
A few of the cons:
-There is no scroll wheel like on the Blackberry.
-The battery charge doesn't last longer than a day or so if you've got data push to Outlook enabled.  If I forget to charge it at night, I'm SOL.
-The volume strip on the righthand side drives me nuts.  I'm constantly hitting it by mistake.  When I do, an annoying popup interrupts whatever I'm doing.  You can disable the volume strip, but it's kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player.  A simple classic volume dial on the side would be a huge improvement.  The strip never seems to work right when I really intend to adjust the volume.
-The keyboard is nice, but a touch screen would be better for certain apps.  There's no way to cut-and-paste
I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable. I put a 1 gig memory card in it. Right now, I have a 140,000 word dictionary on it, the NIV bible, Star Wars, many videos of my son, about 100 wma songs, and a ton of pictures. It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts, appts, tasks, and emails are always up to date. It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset. It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The camera takes decent pictures and video. One of the best features is the battery life. For all it does it lasts an incredibly long time. I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price. I like it waaaay better than the treo, blackberries, Q, or any other qwerty device. It's glued to my hip and I use it all the time. I love it!!
A very good product. For traveling people with GPRS Internet access.  The charger is good when you are away of power.
The MPT version is Ok but more value is for seem editing (for professional and expert users only)
The headset works fine, people who I talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well, but I doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time, also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset
After trying this phone out a few days here are my personal results
Pros
1. What attracted me to this phone were the fitness features, flip phone design and the rugged design. So far I like the pedometer/running tools. You have to calibrate it manually if you want the best results, but right out of the box it's been okay so far. 
2. I've had other mp3 cell phones (LG VX8500 Chocolate, Samsung SCH-A930, Motorola SLVR L7) and this one blows all of the others out in this category. Granted this is not going to contend with the iPod but for a cell phone the Walkman abilities are impressive.
3. User Interface. By far the cleanest and most intuitive I've used. But then I guess almost anything is an upgrade over the Verizon OS.
Cons
1. I can't stand the armband that came with this. The length of the headphones cord is way too long for running, at least for me personally. It's taken me a few times to figure out something comfortable in terms of cord management.
2. Button layout. My hands aren't big by any means but I still have trouble with some of the dedicated buttons (Walkman, Internet, Shortcuts, Power On/Off). 
3. 2 Megapixel camera. I said I don't use the camera feature often and i'm glad I don't for this camera. This has the be the most stripped down, barebones 2 megapixel camera I have used. 
Overall I must say that I am satisfied with my purchase; I'm still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phone. I had the choice between this and the W810i for the same price at the Sony Store and I opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and I must say that these two features haven't let me down yet, otherwise I would've gone for the W810
So I welcome myself to the more powerful world of the Cell Phones.  I've been a fan of Sony Ericsson's phones after I've seen what they really do and when I had the Z500a long time back when I won the phone during hurricane season, I thought the phone was great.  My only thoughts were that despite the phone being a Flip Phone and having a "Music Player" that the phone only had 15MB of space to begin with and to top it off, its camera wasn't great.  Thanks Sony for your answer.
I have already made a few quick station buttons on the W710 and the best part is that I feel original with the fact that I'm the only one that has it in my school and among my friends.  Most people I've seen the only chance they have is getting the W810 and while that phone looks ok, the W710 just fits me right.  The phone's color scheme, the style of the phone, the phone's technogeekness (for those of us who love technology), and the fact that many people (namely the girls) find it a cute phone (Don't know weather that is good or not, but at least it attracts some attention).  The fact that the phone's user interface is for the most part the same as every phone from SE, it makes it that much easier to learn the phone's buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old Z500.  With 2GB of expanded memory that I put in it and the phone's already 17MB of internal space, the phone has many possibilities!  And the last part before I go is that with the fact its an Active phone, you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day, check your training, and more! It even gives you rewards for being active.
So for those needing a nice looking phone, want walkman power for mp3's and FM Radio, knowing your fitness activity, this is the phone for you
Note:  I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710i's features work in comparison. I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function.  My son's Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not. Review is based on 1 week of usage.
I've also purchased the z710i for my son and will review that one later.
Strengths: 
*Improved picture quality of 2.0 megapixels vs. 1.3
*Excellent voice quality with headsets (wired or bluetooth)
*Text, SMS, MMS
*shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features
*Battery life is outstanding
*mp3 player
*RSS reader
*Bluetooth synchronization of files
*Ability to set up phone in non-english languages
*Ability to buy an international SIM card to avoid extra fees
*Sync cord charges the battery
*Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable (if you don't have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big $$$)
*FM radio - reception is so-so in the downtown area
*standard or flight mode option to use while on airplane
*Edge technology - my p10i did not have this.  I can download email extremely quickly now!!!
*step counter & calories expended
Neutral: 
*The international charger with an adapter for US outlets.  It is very wobbly in the outlet.  I'll invest in a US version.
*Inability to sync with any computer using Windows Vista (I'm sure a workaround is coming)
*I haven't used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounter's accuracy.
*Others have warned about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna, I haven't had a problem with this.
*Over-the-ear earbuds don't fall out!
Weaknesses: 
*Since I have other Sony phones, I am disappointed that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger.  Translation, you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones. 
*There is no way to charge the phone and use the wired headset. You either listen to the radio or charge the phone.
* You can not use the standard over-the-counter headsets because there is no outlet for it.
*Need to switch settings to view more than one email account
*Yet another memory card format (micro)another adapter needed
*Memory card only 512mb (can purchase 1 or 2gb)
*picture caller id only works after you open the phone (edit March 21,2007 - if you have answer on open set)
I purchased my W710i from an internet company for $254.00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days. I'm unsure if I can provide their name here.
Overall: Sony has always produced quality products. I love this phone and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone. I do miss using my styllus.  If you don't need the bells and whistles of a smartphone, go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender.
If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I would even though I haven't tried all of the features of this phone.  Buy it without hesitation!
ADDENDUM March 5, 2007
I dropped the phone on a tiled bathroom floor.  When it hit, the clip, battery cover and battery scattered in different directions on the floor.  Amazingly, the phone still operates.  The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone.  A mark like that could happen in my purse!
I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again!
The mp3 player is simple to use, accessible while the phone is closed, and sounds great.  You can use any headsets or earbuds you prefer, and the radio makes it the device of choice for gym-rats or runners alike.  Sturdy, fairly easy to figure out, and fine reception.  A great phone if you don't need "smartphone" features
Sony Ericsson W710i is a very nice cell phone, 850/900/1800/1900 GSM, pedometer, bluetooth, gprs, IR, 2Mpix camera, mp3 player (512 MB included) and so on. This baby is loaded
The original battery never lasted an entire day if I talked very much.  With this replacement battery, I never run out of power anymore.  I do charge it every night. The battery is a little bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip.  The new battery comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly
I received my phone and everything was good.  When I looked at my bill Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular.  So Cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of $30.  I called and had it removed
I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer. I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned. The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didn't intend but it's really not that big of a deal; I just need to re-train my hands. I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality. The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
This phone is incredible, and I'm so happy I bought it through Amazon...very good deal and smooth transaction! I definitely recommend getting this phone. Here's my run-down of it:
Pros:
Excellent voice quality
Excellent sound quality
Great reception...even in places that were "dead zones" with my other phones.
Very compact and oh so sexy sleek
Decent battery life (MUCH better than RAZR)
Easy to follow menu
Cons:
Front side is a fingerprint magnet from hell
Small screen
No warranty available with Cingular
Only a few backgrounds & ringtones to choose from without downloading your own
I also bought the data cable package through Amazon, and it worked beautifully from the first try.
I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations. I will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews...
Music portability, awesome. With the cable that came with my girlfriend's V3i I have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone. There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not transfer, blah blah blah, but there have been only very few songs with any problem. I have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2GB mico card I bought and it has been great. The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for the size. Playlists will also continue to play when the phone is closed, which I found a very nice and convenient touch. 
I re-upped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal reception, which is nothing to sneeze at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR, so I didn't have some POS crap phone prior to the KRZR. As with RAZRs, you have to be careful not to hit the internet button (i wish you could lock keys like on Nokia), but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that. Overall a great phone. I wish Motorola provided you with a disk full of programs INCLUDED with the phone like I was able to get with my Nokia 7610, but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself. Some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on RAZRs and KRZRS, but for an average size guy with average sized hands, this has not been a problem at all. SO FAR, SO VERY GOOD
I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wireless's "New Every Two" program.  My main gripe with the phone is that, unlike my former phone (Motorola V265), it cannot be set to display the time in the 24-hour format (I do not use am/pm).  Otherwise, the screen is nice and bright, it's easy to use, it's much less bulky than my former phone, and the voice activation is easier
I switched to this phone from Verizon e815. Some of the details I find different:
Pros:
Sleek design
Good battery life
Compact
2MP camera
Cons:
Choppy voice sometimes hard to listen
Screen and buttons little small
Works for me as I don't use the phone for internet/email or use lot other features
Great new phone here. Advanced video captures, decent zoom and playback ability. Great for travel, with excellent sounding MP3 player integrated, Bluetooth ready, and big hard drive for tunes. Real good looking design as well. So far so good
For the price... this cover is great. It's thin, easy to dial through and see through, easy to get it on and off. No complaints. I just wish I had it sooner... before i dropped the phone and cracked the screen. I HAVE dropped it since getting this cover and it was just fine
I've used this model headset for 6 months, and the sound quality is great. I drive a truck for a living, and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck. The "windstop" technology works good. I wear it about 6-7 hours a day. The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort. Only problem is it disconnects sometimes at "rest". It beeps when it disconnects, and reconnects automatically, usually within a minute or two. Would (and have) recommended to friends
I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product, but that's not to say that that the product is not without some flaws.  The reception, clarity, and battery life is quite good.  Also, my hearing isn't the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and don't have to strain to hear.  My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit.  I've gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on, but it's still very annoying at times.  Even with this slight annoyance, I would definitely buy this product agai
I just got the cable and the software for my Motorall V600 and it's very easy to use. I just did a backup of all my contacts, pics and music ;
Is Good, protecs every corner of your phone, the keyboard and the screen! Its very good! 100% Recomendation
Good Price. Good color selection.  I liked it.  Better yet, my mom loved it
I really like the fit and function of this Cingular 8125 case. All the holes are in the correct location and the belt clip is comfortable (no sharp edges to irritate). I ordered 2 other cases elsewhere that did not fit properly and I sent them back. This one is a keeper
The charger works great and charges quickly. Shipping was also quick (3-4 days) My only complaint is that sometime it is hard to get into the phone and the cord is only about 3 feet long, wish it was longer.
Bought this for my new Samsung Blackjack. Appears to be a genuine Samsung accessory. Works well, what more is there to say
Soft leather, attractive look, and very easy to use.  Over-the-top strap easily secures blackberry in place.  Blackberry can easily be slid in and out of the holster.  I purchased this with my brand new blackberry (8703e) and have not observed a single scuff or scratch on the device after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holster.
The only potential negative is the plastic belt clip starts to dig into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time.
I would definately recommend this item
This is the prettiest one I think! There are other pinks but they are tacky. This mauve is the perfect pink for my taste. Don't ever discontinue this item. These are great
I really like this case. It keeps my phone from getting scratched up and it's really cute. Good price
Received the product on time and its working fine. but its a bit harsh on the ears
Although the i607 (BlackJack) was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectly. The earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button to answer a call. Even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly
good product for how cheap i got it for absolutely nothing wrong with it.  THANK
Product was what was offered and came quickly. No hassle, great seller and amazing price
I travel a lot so something like this I would use to replace all my other USB cables.  Its compact and easy to store away.  I forget which seller I purchase from but its small lightweight and shoudl ship quick
Not looking to spend the cash for Bluetooth, but need something to work? This is it. With the extra button you can answer, put a call on hold, or hang up without fumbling for your phone. Very happy with the purchase
This headset is actually really comfortable.  I really don't opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly.  The sound quality is really good and people on the other end can hear me quite well.  Great product and great price
I had ordered this case just for my wife and it fit like a glove. We both have Sprints Katana and you cannot find a better case at its price. A definate buy
I bought this for my Sanyo Katana phone, which is a bit thicker than the Razr. The fit is snug, but not too tight. My only problem is that due to the design, I sometimes accidentally push the buttons on the side of the Katana when I take it out of the case
I love this phone cover, it looks amazing, I am concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached
This cover is what my "baby blackberry" needed to be protected and safe
It's just as advertised. The cradle has 2 cords, a 110v power cord that's just for charging the spare battery and a usb cord for charging/syncing the 8125. Use it every day
I just bought this headset for use with an LG VX-8300. The stereo headset lets you listen to music and talk on the phone (has microphone built in). 
Works fine
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  
As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow
Srudy phone during all scenarios. MP3 player is great, no compatibility problems. The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone. The camera is more than decent, (much like the 1.0-2.0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past) No problems what so ever, the design is rather smart and simple, without the lack of elegance. The flip-phone factor lets you talk comfortably, and safely with the antena safely away form your brain. The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches. Tiny design details that make it a Sony product. AMAZING battery life, surprising for an MP3 phone
Hey this is a great phone. I have had it for a week now and it works flawlessly. I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phone before but I am really happy. The Camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great reception. Definetly a phone to pick up if you are looking for a new one
This phone form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Micro(tm) (M2(tm)) NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone. It also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand.. almost a hollow feel. But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera. It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated. The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger. The way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception...so you just have to remember that when talking to someone. The inside screen is really really bright! I turned it all the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell. The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too, especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music
this is the 2nd SE phone after T637, and this phone is just better
using it with T-Mobile, it works pretty well as phone and modem
voice: the strongest part, the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years, the speakerphone is OK, not so loud
reception: another strongest part, with T-Mobile, it can get some weak signal when all other don't get signal at all; however, the antenna is located at the top back (where the loop is), touching this part will lose reception
operation: typical SE style, pretty easy for SE users, 3 dedicated buttons: web, messaging, task
cam: excellent, even though it doesn't have auto-focus like K750 and K790, it looks pretty good, even it's better than nokia 6270
bt: very easy to use and pair, with pc suite installed, file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake, the transfer speed is 300-400kB, this is the maximum of bt 2.0 speed
screen: the main screen is pretty bright, even I have to set the brightness down, animated standby screen is simply cool; external screen, however, is monochrome (it maybe a plus when using outdoors, the main is barely viewable under sunlight), it display info only, it's a kinda inconveient when doing self-pic
audio player: I seldom use it because it doesn't support ogg vorbis, which I mainly use, streaming audio supports real only, no shoutcast
conclusion: this phone is a pretty good phone for the price, quad-band is a must for Cingular users, fast EDGE modem for web and tethering
score: I give it 95/100, there're some cons
rare memory card (M2), and it's not hot-pluggable
lack of ogg vorbis and shoutcast support
no default USB mode (always asks when plug in, kinda annoying
Ordered 2 cables from DLN.  They shipped quickly, keep me updated and the cables arrived well packaged.  They are good quality and work well.  I like that it charges the phone as you Sync up.
Highly recommended - and at such a good price
Cable is cheap, works perfectly, and arrived quickly. All you have to do is download the software from the samsung website and plug it in
When I ordered this item I already knew it didn't come with the driver/software cd but minutes after I ordered it DLN sent me an email telling me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me the link. That was nice of them... i'm kind of bummed that that charge feature doesn't work on my phone (D807) but that's just an issue with my phone I guess and nothing with the product.
I like this for more than one reason...so read on,
Reason #1 - It keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data, trust me this helps, when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone. 
Reason #2 - Only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred, so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car.
You will have to use windows media player to sync this phone (Samsung Sync SGH-A707) in order to transfer files. MP3 and WMV/WMA formats work with this phone, i do not know whether other formats work or not.
Let me explain in brief how to sync this phone with windows media player. Connect one end of the cable to your phone first and the USB end to your computer USB port (Preferably USB 2.0). If you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open My Computer on your computer. Now open Windows media player, you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu. From left to right you will be able to see in this order - Now Playing, Library, Rip, Burn, Sync, and Guide. Click on Sync. Make sure your Cell phone is connected, now you will see two halves in the same window, left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it goes (your cell phone name apears on the top), usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file, this takes a while. Also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card, as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory.
Once you are well versed with what your phone can play, i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB reader/writer as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer, this saves you a chunk of time and battery power.
This cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere.  I received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an email to let me know where to download the appropriate program free from the Samsung website.  Works great
I ordered this USB cable for my Samsung SYNC and it came fast. While there is no software provided I quickly found out it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could add music to my phone. After searching I found that Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for FREE! If you want to fully utilize your Sync's camera and MP3 capabilities I highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to Samsung's site for the free software
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color

If you own a Q, you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible.  This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery, which is great. So I can charge my phone with the standard battery, and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot. Never having to worry about battery life again. Also, it makes a wonderful stand for the phone, and when hooked to the USB cable, you get data conectivity too.  Only downside, it won't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged.
Many people are having issues with the 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm adapters and Treos.  This adapter works FINE in my Treo 650. 
The plugs fit fine (I got the 2 pack) and I get STEREO sound through both headphones. 
If you do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will NOT get stereo sound. My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony (isolation) headphones work fine with this adapter. 
Maybe I'm just lucky, but for this low price, this adapter is fine. If you want sterling sound you shouldn't be listening to mp3 anyway. I can hear the limitations of my files on the treo, so it's clearly good enough
This is the kind of thing you don't care about unless it malfunctions.
I've had no problems at all with it. It seems sturdily built, and unlikely to break easily. The right-angle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device (A problem with straight plugs). It doesn't seem to have been made as cheaply as possible, but instead made well
I wondered if the "snap on" concept would feel and look secure.  It DOES.  It's rock solid and looks like it's part of the phone.  Additionally, the extra protection it provides to the little screen is wonderful.  I'd love to buy more colors when/if they become available
I am very surprised how well this case fit my Razr V3M. It fits very well and looks very nice.
Great for the price vs buying it from your cell phone company
The cable works great with my SGH-707 but the cd did not have the right driver.  However, you can download the correct driver from samsung.com.  I recomend to buy the cable and then download the driver for your phone
The cable was perfect -- exactly what I needed, but it took way too long, over ten days, to get here
Holds the phone in an attractive, snug, leather case!  Clips to belt and holds tight.  Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical, I don't have trouble catching it on things.  I've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car.  The phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap.  This case works great and eliminates that problem!  The perfect solution
This case is made for an L6. The L2 uses the same case, so they both fit within this rubber case. However, the keys are laid out differently on the L6 - so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys. I didn't give it a low rating, because it's well built and is actually a really great product - just wanted to give  other L2 owners a warning. It works well, but it's just a little funky on an L2, but totally usable. For the price, you just can't beat it - and it's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket
This was better than we thought it would be.  Even though the keys are covered, it is still pretty tactile.  Would have liked something to protect the screen.  Overall, great protection for the price.  Looks better in-hand than the pictures on-line
After about a year, the ear support on this Bluetooth headset broke.  Bad news.  Good news: it has a 2 year warranty and Logitech is replacing it with a Mobile Traveller model since the Mobile Freedom is no longer made.  Contact Logitech Tech Support / Audio by phone (can't be done over the web).  It's nice to see a company stand behind their products.  Way to go, Logitech
Works great, its a bit bigger than some headsets, but in this case I feel thats a good thing, the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you don't get a feedback loop where the person you're talking to hears themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker.  The only complaint would be I wish the volume went up just a bit more, it can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly.  One note to anyone buying one...  the hole to plug the charger into is under the thing that holds it onto your ear, it rotates out of the way.  It took me awhile to find it when I first got it
To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either:
a. Feedback loop:  Where the other person hears themself speak
b. Ambient noise:  The other end hears everything around you, especially in a car
In minimizing these, the Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best.  I've tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without extraneous noises.
As for me, I hear everyone fine on all the headsets, but a conversation is a two-way street and if you've ever used a headset, I'm sure you're tired of hearing, "Take me off that stupid thing!"
The negatives with this headset are far outweighed by the call clarity.  Yes, it's big and ugly, but your friends will thank you.
The other negative to be aware of (although I assume this is more due to the age of my headset as it's only recently started doing this) is that I've found is that after 1 year, while the battery still holds a charge well, it sometimes drops the link to the phone when I hang up after a call and I can't get it back until I recharge the thing.  Like I said, it's getting a bit old though.
Overall, if I was going to buy a new one, I'd get this one.
As far as the other 3 tested, I'll rank them in order of call quality (best to worst).
Plantronics Discovery 655 (not too bad, but hard to keep in your ear)
Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX (more for wireless stereo headphones than for calling)
Motorola HS850 (Looks cool, but a total piece of garbage)
p.s.  If you're wondering why I have 4 headsets it's because there's nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone.  1 for the car, 1 for the home, 1 for the... well you get the picture.
I've had several gens of the candybar blackberries, 7100 nice but reception/mike was horrendous, 7130 much better, finally nailed it. Was dubious when I had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky.... but I'll give it the full thumbs up now. Slightly smaller than 7130, which oddly does make a difference, like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something. Makes my partner's Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison. Unobtrustive in yr pocket. The "pearl" trackball is just fine, like it better than roller actually. Reception, mike quality are also good, despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130. Writing is good too, the suretype continuing to be so durn accurate I sometimes forget to check. And hey, I like having the camera. So, I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone, the one that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great.... but actually... I like the Pearl better. If you need bulletproof email, PDA, and phone, this is yr baby. Slightly shorter battery life, but hasn't stranded me yet.
My first blackberry and I love it! I wanted to stop lugging around a phone AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts, calendar and task-to-do list. I wanted a phone that synched with Outlook and was a great phone.  The Pearl is definitely the BEST choice.  I didn't really care about internet, music or camera, but the cheapest $30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly - it's just great!  I bought the $40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it.  I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and it's GREAT to be able to instantly recognize who's calling from the music.  Camera is ok - not great, but ok and very nice to have for on-the-spot photos that you don't want to lug around the regular digital for.  I actually emailed a picture on the spot - very cool.  Battery life is phenomenal so far.  However, I'm not a heavy user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day. 
Only cons so far are: 1) getting used to the keypad - believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word.  I've followed other folks' advice and don't really look at the words letter by letter - i type a sentence and then look - it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word.  Still, this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user, but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim.
2) Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone - I have to reseat the battery to get the change to take effect.  Hmmm...
3) Volume when talking, even on speakerphone, is average - not terrible, but ok.  So far, my reception is fine.
4) I also wonder how long the track ball will last - I'm not a heavy user and I still use it constantly.  I think i'm going to buy the insurance plan just in case.
These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more.  Bye Bye Dell Axim.  It's true what some say - I'm a "crackberry" because playing with this thing is addictive. I'll update this review again in 3 months or so, but I don't anticipate any problems.  My only regret is I didn't hold out until a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosk.  I would honestly give this phone 4.5 out 5 stars if they let you
Top line: This is the best BlackBerry I've ever used, and among the best phones I've ever used.  I can use it at work and after hours with out compromise in functionality and style/size.
I've been (some what grudgingly) using Blackberry since the first "pager-style" 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthrough for me.  Finally, I have a corporate device that treats me like a consumer!
The good:
- Great voice dial: particularly if you are a commuter with a headset.  No need to record your voice for each address entry- just say who you want to call and it it doesn't understand you it will prompt you for more info.
- Size and appearance: Finally I don't look like a dork talking to something the size of my palm.  The phone is as small as many phone-only candy bars.
- Easy private email set-up (as with all modern BlackBerries).  Seems to have some sort of auto set-up for Mac mail and Gmail, others too I imagine
- Macintosh compatibility: I just bought "The Missing Sync" for Apple Mac OS X ($40 USD) to synchronize my address book, calendar, tasks and notes from my MacBook Pro.  Works great! The software provided by RIM is not very easy to use.
- Fantastic screen and innovative "Outlook Today" style summery screen for missed calls, latest emails etc.  Look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with the phone.
- As others have mentioned, the keyboard is very good.  Coming from a full size BB keyboard, I thought I might miss it, but the 8100's is a breeze to use.
The not as good:
- Speaker phone is functional and sound quality in general is fine.  Nothing like my Sony Ericsson though...
- I think I have a minor voice quality issue between the phone and my Motorola H700 headset (the best headset I've ever owned).  I think that it might be a compatibility issue. 
- More Mac compatibility would be appreciated - like native iSync and bluetooth support
This is my first BlackBerry device. In fact, this is the first cell phone I've had where I had a data plan setup. I gotta say I'm luving it! My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop. The browser is very robust and seems to work great. I've installed a few extra applications (google maps, bbweather, and Yahoo go to name a few) and I haven't had any problems. The applications cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful. I still have yet to try the Opera browser for the BB. The camera is so clear with and without the flash it's scary. It beats my old cameraphone hands down!
I've discovered that the moniker "CrackBerry" is so true. I'm just hooked on getting emails, surfing the web and listening to some tunes, all from the same device at the same time. I've discovered a whole community of simmilar BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of this device.
The pearl's suretype keyboard learns as I go and words it didn't get right at first it now picks up and selects as I type. I don't even need to censor the typing too often anymore. I stuck with the suretype mode and caught on to it right quick. This may be because I've never used any other type of mobile device keyboard prior to the pearl. The learning curve was but a shallow hill. 
My only complaints are that the mp3 player will not play through a wireless headset. You can trick it into doing so, but normal play is only through the speaker on the device or through the wired headset. Also the speakerphone is a bit muffled as the battery cover actually covers up the speaker! Now there are after mod kits that have an oem battery cover with a hole for the speakerphone, but come on. Finally the vibration of the phone is kind of weak. Not a big complaint but it bears mentioning.
Overall this device is great for beginners like myself. I cannot recommend it enough
I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device. Its stylish, beautiful, small, and it has some awsome features. However, since i bought it from Amazon, Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number. So I constantly had to call amazon and ask them about my order. Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didn't want to work. So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card... when it wasn't. Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL. Overall, Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy. But whatever I love shopping @ Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too. :)!!
I've had this phone for about a week now and I'm glad I waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive. Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windows-based devices, there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions. Also, I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type. Boy was I wrong about that one. OK, so for the review.
My motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first, with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the device. The Pearl fits that bill perfectly. Phone quality is excellent. Loading ringtones (a pain at first) proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research. Ringtones play very loud and clear. The music player is MUCH better than first impressions would lead you to believe. After a few hours of frustration, I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app. Again, did some research, visited a few forums, and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize. As an owner of a NANO, I was disappointed with the interface of the player. But once you go into the menu functions, you'll find much more functionality. It's not an ipod, but it works as an decent replacement. And if you're not an ipod owner, you'll likely have no complaints. Sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones. Camera is only so-so, but I don't really care about that anyway. Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera. The couple of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy. Part of why I dropped my rating from 5 stars. As far as email, I have a BB from work and they won't let me use a non-work issued device to access the network, so I have no opinion on email functionality. Organizer features (calendar, tasks, notes, etc) seem more than adequate. Much better than any of my old Pocket PC devices.
The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I haven't been able to figure out and while I'm admittingly not a techie, these should be pretty basic and intuitive. One, I would like to set one of my ringtones as the default ringer. That should be fairly simplistic but I can't figure it out. Two, I would like to change the order of the icons on some of the themes. Again, should be pretty basic, but no go. Almost forgot, can't listen to music through bluetooth. Not sure why, but this is really my only MAJOR complaint.
Only minor complaints. All in all, a pretty sweet device. And BTW, form factor and looks are simply the best out there. I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack, very happy that I went with the Pearl.
UPDATE - Figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons. Coming from a Windows mobile environment, I was expecting something along the lines of: Start-programs-etc-etc. Everyting in windows takes so many keystroks. With the Pearl, it was so easy. I was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience. I'm going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo. Otherwise, as close to a perfect device as I've used (and I've used quite a few)
This is my first BlackBerry phone and I must say it's an awesome device!  My husband has a BlackBerry through his work so I got one too.  How we can PIN each other, keep in touch via email, etc. while he is away.  The Pearl has wonderful reception, great style, great features, etc.  
I highly recommend it
I had a palm 650 for two years. It had a few issues, but generaly speaking it worked well. Unfortunately one of my big concerns was the phone size.  When I first Bought it, I did not think it woud be a big deal. But after having it for a while, it felt like I was carring a brick in my packet (If you are an smart phone user, then you know what I am talking about.) I wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size. I was debating between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearl. At first I thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palm, Q, or bjack; but I had it for 3 months now and to tell the truth,there is so many advantages on this phone I do not miss my palm at all. The pearl not only does not have the flaws that palm does, but also has the same (or more) capabilities and browsing speed. The trackball works way better than a touchscreen. So far I am very happy with my purchase that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack. The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring a phone and not a brick in my packet. Not sure about it? then do not believe me; simply check the reviews of all smarth phones online. You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other smart phones
This product was perfect, all I needed to move pictures from my phone to my pc.  Highly recommended.
neat cable, good connectors, but haven't established communications between PC and cellphone with cable yet
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  
As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow
This is a great phone for a first phone for kids. I have had it for six months and it is the best one I have ever had. I like it so much that I don't wanna get rid of it
This phone is great! I got it for Christmas and it works like a charm! The loud speaker is excellent and the ringtones are cool. Some of the wallpapers are a bit weird but they have nice ones too. The ringtones are loud and you can easily hear it ringing. the LCD screen is big and the menus are easy to navigate. The buttons are a comfortable size and I love this phone. So far I haven't found any flaws at all and the phone has great battery life. I had to  keep it on for a few hours and the bars stayed the same! I highly reccomend this phone to any who like it. The phone is light weight and small and it doesn't get in the way! I love this phone and have encouraged someone to get one already. Even though it doesn't have a camera, I'd say that it is still great! As for the cons....I cannot think of any and anyone who says that you cannot hear it ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong company. Virgin Mobile is great but not designed for those people who are on their phones all day. It's not the phone's fault.
I bought this little phone 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it.  I don't use it every day, or even every week.  I got it to keep with me when I'm driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now.  It has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars.  What I like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can be easily tucked inside pockets or small bags.  It charges fully in a very short time, under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that.  It holds that charge for a very long time as I just found out recently. Driving to an appointment I was running late and needed to call to let them know.  I'd forgotten to recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail.  To my delight it turned right on and I made the call with no problems.  Can't beat that.  The Virgin prepay plan is perfect for users like me and ends up costing about $6 a month.  Tell me there's something better and I'll say prove it.  I looked long and hard to find the best possibility and this was it.  I think it still is.  For a nice, dependable "insurance" type phone, I couldn't be more pleased and genuinely recommend it.
This phone is great!  It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the  low ringtone problem by searching for "audiovox 8610 hack" over the internet.
You can purchase a cable on ebay and d/l some free softwares over the net. Then you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free.  Of course you have to be computer-savey to do so.  So don't do it unless you know what you're doing.
The phone allows 20 seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone.  The cool thing is that each ringtone can be attached to a phone number in the phonebook so you know who's calling by the ring.
I downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from the net and mix 'n match them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones.  
example:  3 stooges sound +  bell ring + whistle +  homer "doh" + wolf howl - all in one 20 second ringtone.
I also made some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well.  
I noticed some songs and sound-effects are louder than others.  Thus I only keep the loudest  ringtone and they're very loud!  I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the ring in my pocket and backpack.
Overall, this phone is always on sale at places like Target. If you can make your own ringtone and download it into the phone, you can have all the free custom ringtones you could ever dream of
I have to admit, if you want more from prepaid, Virgin Mobile is a rip off. But if you're only going to use your phone once in a while, then it's alright. I bought my Audiovox about a year or two ago and it was a good investment. Sleek phone, outer dsiplay, the calls were good quality and I never would get dropped calls. Furthermore, the color display is great and the battery life is amazing. 
The phone has all the basic features, looks great, and is practical for anyone who's not looking for anything outrageous like cameras or Mp3. I have also say that despite the service Vmobile has good phones.
But now that I'm needing my phone more and more I'm ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the whole 25 cents a minute and 10 cents after that is too expensive. I have to agree with the other reviews. And for their new "promotions" those hardly last and are only for new customers..so much for customer service. The ringtones are a little pricey, but still reasonable; test messaging is available at 10 cents, good price. 
If you want to get more features, minutes, whatever, I say look into other prepaid offers like net10, tracphone or T-mobile. You get more prepaid with t-mobile but the phones with good stuff will cost you a bit more
hey...im also 14 yrs old and i've owned this phone for about 2 months....i absolutely luv this fone...i originally wanted the tmobile sidekick. but i couldn't switch my carrier and it was waayyy expensive...so i looked for a fone that is great for texting and i wouldnt have to pay alot for texting...and i found this one !!!!...the only thing is it doesn't have an mp3 player nor a camcorder...also, it is a bit bulky and it doesn't have as much features as the enV...but i have it for what i wanted it for....TEXTING...this fone has instant messaging and multimedia messaging..virgin mobiles service is good, but i have to be honest i do not use this fone to talk, but only to text...so i can't tell u how the talking service is...my parents totally luv virgin mobile for teens...u don't have to be a teenager to have this fone, but this fone is ideal for a "text-crazed teenager"..BUY THIS FONE !!!
*** i jus found out that kyocera has a new upcoming fone...its lyke the 2nd version to the switchback...its called the kyocera m1000...so look it up and see wat its about...it looks just lyke the "enV
I bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago, so I got a good deal on it. Well, as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard. Other than that I have had no problems, call reception is great. The camera on this phone isn't the greatest but I don't need it to be high end for the basic fun pics I take. If you're looking to get zoom in, larger, clearer pictures this isn't the phone for you. The camera screens can be a bit confusing but I've learned to deal with it & my pics come out as I like. A strange feature is the speakerphone, while it is quite loud & clear, Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound. Aside from these things, I love my switchback. The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small. 
As far as plans are concerned I don't have any problems w/ over charges since I have the 18 cents/min plan. It's good to know that the monthly plans aren't recommended though. A bonus to the per minute plans is the Sugar Mama service, where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips. Good for purchasing games or ringtones w/o using up your top-up money.
And this cell isn't only for the young crowd, I'm an over 25 mom. I got this phone b/c other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones & those that do require addt'l internet service plans (like Blackberry's, Black Jack & Palm TREO's). I only wanted to easily send txts & have it in one compact phone. This was ideal for me
Ok. I can say I have been a realtor, a nurse,an HR person, a mom. That means a heavy phone user- since 1990. My first phone was the old motorola brick analog. One of the greatest and biggest phones ever. I remember my first digital phone, and first pnone with games. I have had a total of 5 phones, motorola, nokia, ericson, panasonic. This kyocera is the best. I don't want a treo palm because I already travel with a lap top. What I want is a text phone that is small and easy to use. This querty key board rocks. The menu is just like a computer and easy to make selections. The more features you need on the phone, the more you want a qwerty key board. Get this phone and be happy. Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it. Very sturdy little phone, and the antena is the loop so it won't poke you. Comes with  a very easy to read guide book so start up is easy. I paid $199 for this phone in my region and it is worth every penny
I have a Motorola V220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month.  The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally, which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet.  It's fairly light weight and made of plastic, but seems durable enough.  A small red LED lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet, regardless of whether you're charging your phone or not.  I debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price
I purchase this phone for both my wife and I, and we both love them. Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time to learn to navigate, but is very versatile and functional. Reception and call quality are great, and pairing with a bluetooth headset was quick and painless. The screen is bright and crisp. There is no 3g in my area, but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing. Media player works well. Battery life is good with 3g turned off. This phone comes with both a standard and extended battery. With pretty heavy usage, I still have 1/2 battery power at night. 3g is said to really suck the power, though. Lots and lots of 3rd party software available to make this phone do pretty much whatever you want
I've been using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it. Sure there are things I would change, but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes. 
Cons: 
* The keyboard buttons are really small, but then I'm not sure how you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger. And I wouldn't want the phone to get any bigger. 
* If you ever see an ad that has a number like this - "1-800-Big-Deal" good luck on figuring out the alpha-to-numeric translation. Haha. I had that issue not long ago. However, I think all smartphones have that issue.
* Lacks voice dialing via bluetooth headset. This one is big for me. I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr and really miss this feature.
Pros:
The list would be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone. So here are a few:
* Browser support is awesome! I can view everything, even Flash apps!
* VPN support. If you are corporate, 'nuff said. This rocks.
* Easy bluetooth setup and management.
* Perfect size for a Smartphone. Not too wide and very thin.
* Glass screen (doesn't scratch) and screen resolution is unbelievable.
* Quick toggle scroll button on side is a life saver.
* Extended life battery comes with the phone. 
* Easy side access to SD card. No having to slide the battery off to remove or replace.
There are a ton of great things about this phone. I hear the iPhone is supposed to be the real deal, but until I see for myself, I'm sticking with this beauty. Buy one. You won't be sorry. I got mine for $75 with a $75 rebate. Free? Can't go wrong which ever way you look at it. :)
This phone is a great corporate phone.  It is the best windows mobile phone currently available, in my oppinion. 
They overlooked a few features:  
-There is no LCD light to tell you its charging status - instead the screen has to be on all the time.  
-There is no way to know when the num lock key is on - so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up.
-In order to unlock the phone, you have to press the on/off button at the top of the phone, which is not in a very convenient location.
-The track wheel feels pretty cheep
this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality.  Syncs to Windows PC and MS Office with ease.  Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery.  Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer.  Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome.  Nice to see this feature return.  When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature, then it was optional, then it was gone.  Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player.  Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating.  Many videos will convert and then not display.  Music is no problem.  Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play.  Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.  Since this is a MS Smartphone, there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone.  Be aware of the aspect ratio, this is a landscape display and not portrait.  If you get games or applications for it be  sure of the aspect ratio.  This is a 240H by 320W display.  Size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness. 
The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing.
Niggles:
1. Camera is slow and not very clear, but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either.
2. need more ring tones. The ones that come with this phone are lame at best.  Download or create some of your own.
3. Need more menu choices.  The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to get around.
4. Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe I should not list this complaint)
Product is ok, don't think it'd protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up.  But it is aesthetically appealing, will protect from small scuffs and scrathes
I bought the item form Eforcity. It is unbelievably inexpensive for how well it works. Since it let me use my headset for my cell phone
I was concerned with the 1 star review so I ordered from desirepro (who had a higher rating) instead of Eforcity. I received my order promptly and it works well
I used the Seidio rubberized case before this. It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pocket. This case is about 1/2 inch wider and thicker, but it protects the phone on all sides except the top. The phone slips in and out effortlessly. It looks great, and the magnet puts it to sleep, which is nice. Even though it is a bit more bulky I can't go back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks. I just use a screen protector, but many use Best Skins Ever with it no problem. It's also pretty cheap ($15). Less than the Seidio and other pouches out there.
You can pretty much do anything you would like with this product!! The only draw back that i could find is that it doesnt charge while you have it plugged in. Other then that, you can manager anything you would like
after talking to cingular i found out that i would have to spend $40 to get a cable to connect my samsung d807 to my laptop...but the only package they had included headphones...which i did not want...i foud this cable on amazon and saved $30...you can download the software needed from [...] and i can manage anything on my phone that i wan
Had heard other replacement styluses didn't quit fit properly.  These fit my Cingular 8125 perfectly
These replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus
Works just fine! Delivery was earlier than predicted. I am well satisfied. I looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a simple thing but they didn't have them. I was told "they can order one". I thought to myself.......so what, so can I. This was much easier. I ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right to my door----no muss, no fuss. This is the way to buy such items! Thanks for a great job
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  
As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow
Compared to the "face out" belt clip I had previously, this "face in" version has proved to be a bit more stable and sturdy so far.  Hopefully, it will remain so.  For the price, it's not too hard to appreciate. 
You can't beat this price. This holder works great. You must remove your phone before answering it. Make sure you put the phone in with the camera facing the clip. I put it in backwards at first. The phone won't stay in that way
This is a great holster, really cheap price, I ordered a couple this time because it's only fault is that it will break pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hit it on the arm of a chair, but for the money it's great
This is a great cover to the Sansa MP3 player.  It is heavy duty rubber that is thin where it can be and thicker in all the necessary places.  It has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the Sansa screen from scratching or shattering.  You'd be silly not to purchase this $20 case to protect your $150+ investment.
The one downside I can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allow the player to sit in most cradles, docks, or speakers.  It is not difficult to put the case on, but it would be frustrating to take it on and off often.  Just something to consider if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often.  The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the toughskin on
I gave this four stars because the `jacket' adds significant bulk and weight to the Sansa product. What was once a slim, sleek product is now a rather large, rubberized item. On the plus side, this jacket definitely protects the MP3; it is very solid, and covers the item completely and securely. They included a belt clip, and a screen cover that is very hard and will not be easily scratched. The buttons around the wheel are far easier to press now. I wish there were other color choices, but over all I'm very pleased with the product. Before it was covered I was reluctant to put in my purse or pocket for fear of breakage and scratches to the screen, but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go. Highly recommended product
The Sansa e200 is good for all of the things it will do considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the Ipod Nano.  Unlike, the Nano it will play video and comes with its own video conversion software.  Further, unlike the Nano, the Sansa has a built in FM tuner and FM recorder which can be nice.  Finally, the sansa has a voice recorder which I do not have a personal use for but just goes to show how feature rich this mp3 player is.
On the negative side:
The Sansa, which will accept upto a 2gig MicroSD memory card, but turns on slowly when a memory card is placed in the expansion slot.
I like to listen to audio books and the Sansa does not have the ability to bookmark.  This makes listening to audio books very difficult.
Overall, the Sansa is a very feature rich player with a great battery life   with only a few shortcomings
I bought this case for use at work. I work in a semi-dusty shop environment. I'm always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well. I don't have to worry about the screen getting scratched (The screen on the Sansa e2oo series scratches very easily) with the hard plastic screen protector. I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and co-workers.
While I thankfully haven't had to test the protective qualities of this product, it appears it will do the job nicely. The only thing I would change is to give it a fixed belt clip
Great case, protects my Sansa well, even makes the buttons easier to push. Decent Sansa products are hard to find, thank you Speck
great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user.  strong and looks good.  It even comes with a clear plastic screen saver.
I am very happy with this product
This is a must for anyone that is 'mobile'.  I am never home.  Always at Starbucks or Libraries studying and this added safety is necessary to protecting the player
I really like this protective cover.  It is very well made, and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall.  The funny thing is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it.  Before I bought the ToughSkin, the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped.  Now that it is in the case, it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure.  It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it.  The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well.  The only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect.  Overall, this is an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend
This cover is the best you can get for your Sansa E series player. It increases the size a little but the durability is worth it. The belt clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too. I purchased an armband but this is much better.  It also comes with a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary item, my display began to show minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use, so if you don't buy this, at least get the little expensive stick on covers. The toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier. The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the micro-sd slot without removing the Sansa, but that is only a small issue. My advice, you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 player so spend a little more and protect it the best you can
I'm a previous owner of Body Glove Cel Phone cases (a Moto V810).
I purchased this item from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255.  My Cel fits perfectly. The case protects every part of my Cel (buttons, screens, jacks) and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case, and looks nice.
My next phone will have its body glove case too
I got this case/holster a while back after another maker's fell apart in a short time.  I was impressed with the reviews I saw here. What I would add is that the case is durable and I am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months
This case was a perfect fit for my Mot V180 phone. The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately, then snap together so they stay in place on the phone so it can't easily fall out (a problem that I'd had with a different product). The part that slips over the top of the phone has a built-in see-through window that lines up just right, so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case.
The quality of construction looks to be pretty good, too
I was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone. I wanted a holster that wasn't a sloppy generic model that didn't fit. I was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and I tried it on my Motorola V180. It fits like a glove and looks good. No complaints here. So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you, that you won't be disappointed. The added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer:
This is a great case! I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didn't line up.  Because this is a flip phone, most cases move when you open and shut the phone, covering speakers, etc.  This case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement, when you open and close the phone, doesn't affect the placement of the holes, etc. in the case.  Also, the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent. 
After reading the reviews here of this case, I thought I'd take the plunge and try it.  The cases I'd seen in stores were fairly cheesey, although they were cheaper.  This is a wonderful case.  The materials are first-rate and the fit is perfect.  I highly recommend this case
From longviewer's advice I got this case and he was right on!!!! Awesome custom fit!! Great case for the money THANK YOU !!!  Gar
This is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free Motorola V180 - Spend the money on this case to protect your phone!  I looked at many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly - really PROTECTIVE.  The V180 apparently has had a few comments on the home screen going ka-plooky - 'nuf said - I needed a better grade, clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad.  Sydney Harbour gets high marks on this feature - not flimsy dull plastic but very clear, quality stuff.  Secondly, the super-soft, matte black leather is a sweet fit - nice and snug, form-fitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching.  The cut outs are perfectly lined up too - there IS one for the speaker phone feature on the back (not mentioned in the ads).  Snap on the antenna loop and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel.  Sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product - but if you're like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life, you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases. Be nice to yourself and your phone - Go with Sydney Harbour and avoid the cheaper stuff
This device works great.  I use it on a USB Laptop to charge the Treo 650. I also use it on a wall outlet and the car.  No problems.  The cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient.  It does not come with a case, so you'll use your own bag or whatever.  The part that fits into the Treo is very secure.  It does not pop off like other chargers.  The only thing I can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged
Retractables just take up less space among all the head phone wires, chargers, and you name it junk in our console between the van seats
We were deperate for a charger.  The local stores seemed to be out of them.  And we got it overnight as requested.  Unbelieveably fast.  Thank you - thank you - thank you!
Functions the same as more expensive chargers sold in Cellphone stores.  Excellent product for the price.  I bought two...one for home and one for work
 The included software for the USB cable does not have software or drivers for the enV VX9900. Price is right for the car charger though so I am not mad
Skin was great and was shipped as described.  It really helps protect my Q. I like the texture of the skin,  feels like rubber.  Overall, it's worth buying.  It really protects my Q from scratches
Nice price point.  Good quality.  Can't complain
Great little item. Charges phone and second battery at the same time. It is nice to have it on the desk and I can use the speaker phone on my desk. No complaints about this charger at all
Belt clip is sturdy.  Velcro is velcro (it's solid, but the separation noise can be annoying when you're trying to get to your phone in a quiet setting).  Love the flexability of the side connectors, allowing quick access to the phone.  Comfortable and fairly low profile.
I have a Samsung D807
Shipper delivered this product in a timely manner and the product is of great quality
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look
Though it makes the phone a little more bulky than you might be used to at first, it quickly becomes a non-factor and though it doesn't provide quite as much extra life as I had hoped it would, it does in fact make the difference between my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry. A solid purchase
This car charger for the Blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores at a fraction of the price.  It is well made and works perfectly.  I also use it to charge my Motorola Bluetooth headset that has the same USB mini jack
I had been using this product for 2 weeks now. No problems/discomfort. Quality stuff
These cases were not available when the Pearl hit the market, we were able to get them from this merchant.  Good quality item at a great price.  Thank you
I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake.  Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potential to last a long time, something that prior holsters have failed to do. I also like the magnetic closure, which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case, without the need for finding a snap fitting.  My older Blackberries have had cases which, after use, had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the "two-handed" method for nesting my phone, one hand to move the flap out of the way, and the other to insert the phone into the case.  This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the more-preferred "one-handed" approach. Although still relatively new, my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction. 
Before I purchased my Leather Swivel case, I looked at 3rd party generic cases.  Each of these were unable to "notify" my Blackberry that it was in its holster.  With my new swivel case, as soon as I insert my Pearl, the display shuts off thereby extending battery life.  In addition, this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or not.  Also, since this is an OEM case, it was made especially for my Pearl.  When holsetered, both the USB connector,the earphone outlets and the volume control buttons are all accessible. With non-OEM cases, in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone, I might have to remove the phone from its case. 
I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no case at all.  This is probably due to its small size and your ability to just slip the phone into your shirt pocket, unlike prior Blackberry devices.  Of course, that still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratch-potential.  They should have at least provided a simple pouch, which would provide some protection.  This of course is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel case, which is the subject of THIS review.  All-in-all, I highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on your belt ... and since I'm at it, I LOVE MY PEARL
I got this for my moto e815.  You need to hunt down all the drivers and software for it on your own if you want it to work well with the e815... The quality of the cable...well... it disconnects every couple minutes or so... but that was long enough for me to do a seem edit and so now I'll use bluetooth-obex to sync and transfer... which is all I needed it for.  The charger also connected/disconnected constantly...making my phone beep every 10 seconds as it started to charge/not charge repeatedly.  If you plan to use it for this purpose I recommend hunting down Moto phone tools 3.25b, e815 modded PST 7.11, SDmodified p2k seem, and the e815 usb drivers (usbmot2000.inf, and cdm1x.inf) Good luc
Besides all the functions described above, the cable has one more function:it can be used as a charger ,too!This is really cool.The company's  service is great. For every order I put, I received the products within 3-4 days at the price of ground shipping fees
This battery has much better life than the battery that come with the Q.
I would say you can do twice as much talking, surfing, texting, etc. while charging it about as often.
There are higher Mah batteries available for the Q, but they cost $49-$59, so for $13 or so this is a pretty good deal.
The only downside (and maybe I just didn't read description well enough) is that the battery door is silver, which looks dorky on my black Q
Though still not quite enough battery for the juice-sucking Q, it is worlds better than the included battery.  I would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies
The battery Was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly. WIll do business again. The Battery Make's the Phone Last 2 days even with continued use
Great buy if you use your Q like I do, I watch movies, play NES games, listen to music, oh yeah, make call, send text messages, etc. Good investment..
This product was a great deal. These can be found other places for over $20. If you are like me and drop your phone constantly, then this is a great product for you
I really like this case!  It is easy to put on and take off.  It does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen.  It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold.  I would like for more colors.  I would really like for something to glow in the dark, so that I could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse. 
People keep asking me. Hey what kind of phone is that? Im getting the red one too, and the pink one for my sweetie.  hollar at ya boy
I have tried 4-5 of theses phones over the last 4 years.  This one works the best of all I have tried.  The latest was the Cingular 8525 (HTC makes it) and it dropped 80% of incoming calls on pickup and 20% of outgoing calls. I thinks Windows was loading a DLL - (;&lt;))) The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based SPs
I've had a Treo 650 for a long time.  I wasn't 100% sure I'd want the 680, when it was first announced, but a big nasty scratch on my 650's screen helped me decide to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.  The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better, the internal slot for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might get lost, and the covered SD card slot is very welcome, because the darned thing always popped out in my 650.  The only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button.  To reset the 680, you have to take out the battery.  That's not a big deal, since even on the 650, you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch.  What's better on the 650?  The main thing for me is that the cell phone's radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards (SDHC).  I use this phone for everything, since it's also a great Palm organizer.  In addition to that, I've installed a registered version of Pocket Tunes, so it's a very good MP3 player.  It's even compatible with PlaysForSure, if you're into that.  That's why I'm so happy to see the 8gb support.  I also use the phone to play games, like Monopoly and Scrabble, when I'm waiting on line or in a boring meeting.  I have absolutely zero complaints about this phone.
Believe it or not, i consider going from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrade. i guess the whole battery problem depends on the usage and the person. My battery problem is that i cant kill the darn thing! 
I am one of those people that depletes a battery completely before recharging it. I do it to my laptop and my iPod and the PDA i had before the BlackJack, the Tungsten 2E. Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks. Mainly because you CAN NOT create and edit word, excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook. Which i absolutley can not put up with. Even the contacts wouldn't backup! Needless to say, the Treo 680 saved me. If you do go the way of the blackjack without Outlook, look into SBSH's programs Facade and Papyrus. However, if you go with the lovely Treo check out "DialByPhoto" i think the coolest part is how you can set up a "Favorite 5" like TMobile offers but still have all the reliability of Cingular
I just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it.  It is my favorite phone i have had to date.  Some people ask me "What can that thing do"? and i respond to that what cant it do.  This phone can do anything you really want.  The features are nicely made to be used.  Especially since it has a beautiful 2.2 in touchscreen.  The display is incredible.  I can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do.  The last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance
The Pros: PDA, good mobile phone that really gets out, a camera for all those 'Kodak Moments', all packed in one for a good price
The Cons: You'll need to get a replacement longer life battery (Seidio makes one), and the browser (Blazer) has MANY problems.
I'm very happy with the purchase of this smartphone. I've wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one. You can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software, it's a nice little phone.
I haven't bought a memory card for it, so I can't report on the mp3 capabilities, but I am going in that direction. Somehow I don't think it will replace my iPod, but you never know
I've had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications, I especially love having the Goodlink email application, my family videos, mp3's, pics, and all my office documents at a touch of a finger. Yes the battery life goes quickly but I don't mind charging my treo every night.
The slick and slim design is a real eye catcher and feel great in the hand.[...]
in the one month of usage, my Treo has hung, one time, a simple reset fixed it and hasn't hung since
I bought this even though I saw a lot of negative reviews, some about battery life, some about dropped signals. So far I have had neither.
I have owned many Palm devices over the years and I will be the first one to say that Palm can make lemons, and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later, if they ever do. Not the most customer-oriented, quality-oriented company out there. But their OS is still the easiest to use in my mind, and with the myriad of apps out there you can make it do whatever you want, pretty much. 
The screen is on the smallish side compared to the TX, but it's not that bad, especially for a phone. It's pretty reliable, and I have put a lot of my old software on it. The battery is what surprised me the most; I was expecting something really bad, but so far I have never been under 50%, and I am a heavy Palm user. I don't use the phone part of it much, just a call here and there, and I turn the phone function off at night. I also bought KBLightsOff, which turns off the keyboard lights unless you are using it, which probably helps a lot. So with these two settings, battery life is close to the TX in my opinion.
I have one dead pixel, but that can happen to any electronics manufacturer. I don't like the 2.5mm jack at the bottom of the device, that's a terrible place to put it. But with an adapter I can use my good headphones and sound is good. Get pTunes Deluxe so you can use subsription music like Napster or Yahoo Music. I should receive my 8GB SDHC card tomorrow, which will turn my Treo into an iPhone killer, IMHO. And for way less than $599...
Sound level is OK, and you can get software that boosts it up if you're deaf. Speaker level is LOUD! The SMS program is great, the phone app is great and fast.
So, overall, it's a great device. I wish Palm wouldn't charge an arm and a leg for accessories, but you don't have to buy from them..
Overall, I am very happy with this product; it protects the phone without taking away from its beauty nor does it make the phone bulkier. My only compliants are that it does not come with a screen cover and it makes the phone slightly harder to slide open.
I think this would work better with a "money" type clip.  However, since Verizon doesn't carry anything like this in clear, this works
My chocolate phone is obviously valuable to me, so I want to keep it in tip top condition, this skin is incredibely sexy and allows me to use my phone with ease.
Promptly received two replacement batteries for our phones, for the price of one from the original vendor. They work great! They hold a charge, with normal use, for about two-three days, as did our original ones when we first purchased them. Would buy again, if needed
I got a bunch of these and they work perfectly.  Enjoy
Bought this to replace my three-year-old cell phone and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc.  My observations after 30 days of ownership:
1.  Setup is time consuming but unavoidable.  Patience is required.  I've had a couple of questions that I asked Cingular, only to be forwarded to Palm, only to be forwarded to Microsoft, then back to Cingular.  It seems no Customer Service department has really mastered this unit.
2.  Have to do a soft reset every once in a while.  The unit turns off the sound by itself and the only way I've found to fix it is to do a soft reset.
3.  I'm not crazy about Microsoft Outlook's calendar compared to Palm's.  I miss several Palm features, like the "Go to" and the "Today" buttons.  Outlook's calendar just isn't as easy to manuever as Palm's.
4.  Phone listening volume is low, especially when the unit is in a protective case, which puts it a little further from your ear.
5.  Love the Bluetooth option.  It's new to me and it's just great.
6.  Love being able to press a picture to make a call.  We have five kids; I have each kid's picture linked to their phone number.  Even my technology-challenged husband can call them by simply pressing their picture.  
7.  This phone talks!  A female voice announces who is calling and when your next appointment is.  The first time she spoke it about scared me to death.  The voice reminds me of the computer on Star Trek--but not as clear.  However, after getting used to her accent, she is intelligible, which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken words--amazing!
8.  The Internet connection has limited use for me.  I don't need email on the run and I could live without this and the extra monthly cost.  Most traditional Internet web sites take much too long to load and display too small a portion of the page to be useful.  It is nice to check the weather or get directions on the go.  
9.  Can't imagine watching a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen.  What's the point?
10.  Splurged on a sweet little Vaja leather case that is wonderful.  Very expensive, but a terrific luxury.
11.  Amazon's prices were the best BY FAR on this product! Saved over $300 off my local retail Cingular dealer. 
12.  Best part:  I no longer have to carry a PDA and a cell phone!  They are one and the same!  
13.  Conclusion: this phone is very smart and fun to use, although it comes with a big learning curve.  The low volume issue could be a problem for someone with bad hearing
The whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with Cingular Wireless Customer Service to port over my number from Verizon.  The Treo 750 was a snap to figure out, setting up my email took only a few minutes.  I've owned it for three weeks now and I am still discovering great phone/PDA features.  I bought a 4gb mini SD card (samsung memory) from ebay for $39.99.  Combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs.  I also bought a Shure tEC3 earbuds for $110.  They're about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2.5mm jack. 
Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750, but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it won't arrive for about a month and a half!  I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately.  Sad...
Treo 750, one of the best and coolest phone. I am in love with this phone. Because of Windows OS, it is very easy to use and understand functions. Slim and light weight. Love the touch screen function.
I ordered this phone on Sunday evening and got it on Wednesday, Amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones. 
Also I ordered two phones (Family plan), there was some problem in other phone, I requested the replacement and Amazon FIRST sent me the replacement of that phone through FREE 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone. I am so impressed with Amazon's service
I work for an University and my contract was due 2 months ago.  I decided to get this phone because my PDA was already old and I needed something that would be efficient.  I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good things to say about it.  First, it is not as heavy as the last model (650) and also looks really cool.  Second, the interface is pretty easy to use and figure it out.  The phone is Microsoft OS based (I used a palm device before) so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue.  The battery works really well and, in spite of other reviews, the life have been pretty great, even when compared with my last phone (a motorola).
In general, I thinks is a pretty good buy and you cannot beat the price when Cingular sells it for way more money than Amazon.  I'll definetively will buy from this website again
I bought my Treo 750v a couple of days ago. I got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported, like short time lived batery.
The only problem I am facing is with setting my voice mail.
The icon shown in the today page does not accept any number I will to attach to it. As a result, I was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number.
I really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by Palm with a downloadable file because, except for this problem, Treo 750 is really great
Otherwise it would have 5 stars.  Fits my Treo 680 even in the case, which is a big plus
"hi,im a satisfied costumer for the motorola i760 phone.Before all i had was a phone booth,but now that i got this phone no booth for me and evryone is sayen they want one too so im helpen.thanks for the phone.=
my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones i've ever heard. i don't know what it's called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it. the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time, including him. it's great for a business that has many locations. i only give this product four stars because i haven't tried it myself so i don't know all the features. but i hope the review i've provided helps
I came over from Cingular after trying there PTT, just not happening for me,  and I will leave it at that.
I choose this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall, ( Love Blue ) I bought this for 110.00 at a corporate store, I get a discount for the company I work for. We had a problem with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the box phone.  The clarity and ease of functionality is Fantastic, you dont have to be a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the GPS along with Telenav is fantastic, we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower I can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkie's,  hey if your going to spend the money do it right the first time.   I put the extended battery on mine and I get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge, which too me is great.  Dont change the default times for backlighting, thats whats eating the battery time up,  also dont leave a java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also.
Buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds, Moto has a phonebook manager package on there site which is FREE and is SO easy to use.   For Ringtones and wallpapers u can use WebJal, once again EASY to use.   I looked at other phones and I DONT NEED CAMERAS in a phone, the primary selling feature was the fact of large numbers and ease of use.

My husband and I just recently upgraded to this phone.We were going to got to the i560 but got a great deal on these. So far so good. I switched from an i730. What a difference! It seems lighter. It fits in my pocket better. the other always came unclipped when I stood up, falling to the ground. I like the sound quality better also. The screen is a little bigger than the i730 also. The front screen for caller ID seems a little dark and the area to charge it is a little harder to get to(that plastic still gets in the way!) Those are the only negatives so far. I really like the buttons on the i760. Since my husband is switching from an old i90 he loves it! Hope this helps with purchasing. Also if you have no service you can use these as walkie talkies. We haven't tried that yet
I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving, so I decided to upgrade my phones.  (the first 730's speaker grill came off, and i tried to glue it back on myself.  A word to the wise, don't use too much glue.)  So, I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet.  I didn't need a camera phone, since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures.  One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April, I couldn't sign back up for two years and get the $150.  I could only sign up for a year, and I had to pay $275.  I don't understand that.  
But this review is about the phone:
Cons: 
super short battery life, especially if you have the web.
instead of having a separate button for each number key, it has three big keys, with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys. unfortunately, you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center, otherwise you'll dial the number above or beneath it.  
the jury is still out on this one, but i'll list it under cons.  the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic, whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal.
pros:
huge display
a whole lot lighter than the 730
i enjoy the photo caller id.  it also shows the photo when you call that person
the sleep mode is a good addition.  if you don't use the phone for a couple of minutes, the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up.
The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front, especially since there were several colors.  This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blue.  OH well.  I'll write more the more i explore the phone. 
I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo -- it's well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable.  The material is soft to the touch but strong on protection.  I don't like the lanyard they send with the product, it's about 24" long and reminds me of shoelaces.  I prefer a smaller, more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist
I tripped and basically THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk.  With the skin on it, no harm done.  None.  This is the second skin I've owned - the first from JAVOSkin - and I like this one better than the first.  The skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use.  I didn't like the cord attaching bump on the side at first - but I did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag.  I highly recommend this product - whether or not you use the cord
The quality of the product is very good... I love the fact that I can now drop without it ending up in 3 pieces on the floor! The only thing I dont like is that its not exactly grey but not quite clear... but who cares its a great product for a great price..
Idropped my new phone at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere - in 3 places.... With this cover, it is definatly protected....I don't like the smoke color... but who really cares for the price..
This item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesn't easily clip into the phone, you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it
This holster provides good protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt.  The flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device.  It does just what you want it to do
This is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt. My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks. I would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls
I have bought and returned three of these units now. Each one has been defective, and finally I just gave up on returning the system. The DVD player constantly gives "Bad Disc" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc. The sound quality is very nice for the price, but since the player doesn't work, it's essentially useless. This is a complete rip-off at any price point
I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters
Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised!  To date, I've been denied twice.  The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode!  I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted."  Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.
The product itself is average.  I've used better and worse.  That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price
No free lunch & you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?
Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..
This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that?
Now I can't use it at all....
I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now.
Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products.
Buyers beware...
As the other reviewer found out, these cards can't be formatted to work with SD Audio.  Total waste of money
I purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, "It must be your computer." did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well.

When I purchased these batteries, I was very pleased, but that wore off after a couple of months. I don't use my camera all that often, but when I do, I expect ther batteries to have some charge. I recharge them per instructions, and they do not hold a charge any longer.I know Monster makes good products, but I am a little disappointed in this one
You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks.  If you put a textbook on it and turn the page, it collapses and or tears the page.  I wouldn't even use this for a notebook.  
We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up
Bought new around $80.  CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 months--now nap function and radio are all that works--if only I could find the damn receipt!!!
In the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
This is the worst thing I have ever owned!!!! It broke (said there were no cd's inside) after about a week! Do yourself a favor don't get this product, don't buy this brand and don't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. 
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader. 
Pros: Perfect sound, solved resampling issues
Cons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in BF2 (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless.
This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for "X-Fi popping/crackling".  Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time  Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial "hacked" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi crackling is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the "the fastest sound processor" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices. 
Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated sound. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars.
UPDATE 06/12/2006
I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work)
About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, & I've used all of them, & had their (file removal) tech help give up.
In this day & age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself.
If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care.
How important are your pictures to you?

Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event.  I still can't believe it happened.  If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
got it at walmart can't even remove a scuff. i give it -100 good thing i could return it
Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the "repair" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?
This SD would not work in my  Nikon  Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did
I bought this card for my TJ25, supposedly a supported device. But the problems with this card make it nearly useless:
- It comes with a web browser that doesn't work.
- Even if the browser DID work, it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version.
- The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora, which doesn't do anything except display text (you can't even fill in web forms with it, so webmail, searches, etc. are impossible).
- The card is designed to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail, software that comes with Internet-enabled CLIE devices... obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card. These programs are not available separately.
- The card wouldn't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors', even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either, no additional configuration required.
- While attempting to connect, the card would often stop responding, and then lock up the handheld.
Bottom line: if you want a web-enabled PDA, buy a web-enabled PDA. Don't buy this
i've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD, the sound from my system did seem to be a little better (the CD's were not skipping as much).  but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably, although not as bad as before.  ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk CD changer
I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.
I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.
To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.
I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.
For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.
Not a quality reader.
Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.
Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. "Eject" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.
Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick.
Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
Some of the worst DVDs that I have purchased. I wouldn't waste my money on any more of these POS discs. I wish I could return them to amazon, but for what I paid (it was pretty cheap), its not worth the effort.
If they weren't free, I'd give them 1 star.  Media code: MCC 01RG20.  2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008
I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution
The extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy
Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform
I wanted to replace a Lexar 1GB with this, but I'll keep looking. I used it to transfer a 700MB, 2300 file My Documents folder to a new PC. The transfer seemed pretty slow, but deleting those files from the Sandisk took *61* minutes! Back it goes

I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.  
The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.
The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.
1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.
2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making "S" sounds sound more like "H" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.
3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).
I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs. 
 I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!
I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.
I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.
The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.
Infocus says "sometimes this happens".
They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-"It is out of warranty", "sometimes this happens", "1400 hours is just what some lamps get", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.
I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.
They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.
Don't buy Infocus!!!
Good product, forget about service. I e-mailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector. That's right, it's been ONE YEAR since
my projector stopped working, I have given up on it being repaired (it was under warranty) and am now
struggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pocket. Check this company's record at 
the Better Business Bureau, it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.
Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem
The worst customer service I have ever experienced. The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said:"You got it cheaper than other brands, what else do you expect?" "Viking cheats. So what?
This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started.  The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all.  I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help.  It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.
So, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so
Beware of this product.  It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer.  I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly.  I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else
I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way
You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same. This is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there.
1 - The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built. They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about. They are fairly light weight - meaning very small magnets in them. These are 3 way speakers - for really good sound on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way!
2 - The sound input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT. Not even standard phono inputs at the back.
3 - Its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck. What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers. And in case you know some audio - 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts (log relationship). For some reason, this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver!
4 - No user adjustable equalizer, only presets possible
5 - Cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the "biamping" type of connections.
6 - The receiver sucks - even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver.
I concur with the other reviewer - Death to Sony! Shame on them for taking consumers for a ride. This company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it "Competively" with the others - meaning - fat profit margins.
...I'm so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases. They were great, a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside (that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center). Somebody could have sat on it and it would've been fine..
I mean seriously guys, is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card. There is an easier way to do it ya know. For your psp, if the game is really important to you and you can't save it. Just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off..it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again.. just push it back up..and hopefully if you did it right you'll have the game right back in the place you left it..hey it saved me 50 dollars..and it can do the same thing for yo
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is "admin". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.
The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine
This thing is JUNK!!!  Don't waste your money.  I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes, then after powering it down and back up it never did work again!  If you buy one, go through the setup and if it doesn't work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON!  Don't waste your precious time trying to get a $70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time.
Finally, Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged. However, YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES. If the product is in fact good it won't have many bad reviews, or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional. However, look up all the bad reviews for this product. They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product
I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.
My recommendation is don't buy this model!!
This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment
Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3. I have had mine for 9 months. 
I have had this MP3 since Christmas 2005. I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time. Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very "tiny" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player.
First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to
advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement
insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones
always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange
Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.
AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW &  CD RW DISKS!
Was a little hard putting it together.  You have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart.  I am not happy with this product
I have had a Canon G2 since 2002. I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem. In October 2004, I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon. I did not use it until this summer. After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed, I immediately found a few images corrupted. No matter how I tried, e.g. format the CF before use, there were alway corrupted images.
I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer?

Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.  The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas?
The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not send in Mail-in-Rebate. Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode, SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode. How can I resubmit when they already have the barcode?
In my experience with SanDisk, I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted - so you get mail-in rebate 50% of the time with SanDisk. I think mail-in-rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies. Don't trust it!
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether.  I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft.  I've since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it.
This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again.
I wish I could give this device a worse rating, somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate.
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one
It's been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was "shipped" from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order. When I contacted EMARTCRAP, all they could tell me was that it had been shipped. I am sure that flash card works great. I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete. AVOID EMARTBUY AT ALL COST. Don't settle for incompetency. Your are better off paying a higher price for better service...correction any service
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for
I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd's/dvd's.  I can't give a complete review of the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvd... and it did not repair it
How do I assign a rating? As several other people have experienced, my unit is also DOA. I received it, plugged it in, pressed 'clean', and the motor started up. I popped open the cover, put in the disc I wanted cleaned, and pressed 'clean' again. Nothing. Terrible quality control.
What's worse is the unit case is glued together -- no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer. I wasnt impressed. I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!! Many of my CDs I have replaced for $7-10 bucks on here. I wish I wouldve kept my $25
I purchased this flash card in June for my GPS memory. Loaded fine, but only lasted 3 months. Card lost all it's memory and was unable to take a new load. Very disappointed in the life of the card.
As with some of the other reviewers, mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter.  I bought a Vector brand inverter at Wal-Mart and it is much better
This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap
The product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car.  The mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it.  I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail.  I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my money is refunded
About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling.  It has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low -- well it sounded immediately .  I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs.  I hadn't tried to use it since.  Now that I'm taking another trip, I thought I'd try it out in other cars.  No luck.  The thing is dead -- doesn't do a thing when I plug it in
Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data.  Don't waste your money on this one
When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since.
I didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour?
Yes, it has a 1 year warranty: just send the unit back with a money order ($6) to cover the return postage. Of course, then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..
I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.  I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me, BUT after less than a week it the sound  started going down hill to a point where I couldn't listen anymore with it.  It is now in a landfill somewhere.  My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable.  For now just have the radio and CDs I burn
No kidding!!  The shipping charge on these batteries was over $6.00.  Amazon doesn't itemize the shipping charges on your order, so if you order multiple items, you won't know that you're being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late!
Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
These Xtreme cd cases STINKs,literally! I don't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic, but the smell is absolutely nauseous. I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away. Nope. Finally I threw it away. 
Other than the smell, quality-wise it is ok. 
In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making  it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment
I've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row.  I've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks. 
This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price
I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.
I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally.
I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up.
I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first.
The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years. It lights up just fine, and it is a reassuring led gold, but it refuses to do anything with my xd card. It worked just fine for 3-4 days, then erased about 100 photos, all of them irreplaceable. Cheap yes, but Cheap Junk.
The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).
The DVD player completely fails to recognize them.  Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....  
Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed.  More Taiwanese junk.  (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)
As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...
I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work.  This stuff is junk.  In addition, the manufacturer
never sent the rebate.  Don't buy anything from Velocity
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. 
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader. 
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks
Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please
I'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product. 
Performance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk.
I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive.  
Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product
Overall the recorder worked OK. A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons.
However, that is irrelevant now. A few weeks ago, the unit stop working. I does not turn on at all. What a waist! It is out of warranty now
Product :  	MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
We Received Your Item :  	11/03/2006
Customer Comments : 
11/13/2006 07:51 am   	When will I get my repaired or replaced item. You have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status. Please respond (by the way, Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY!).
11/13 Still waiting for an update on the M240 you received on 11/3
No where near as easy to use as my old system ,But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects.But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier
is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter
the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I did
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
I connected all the cables as instructed, but it doesn't work, the light is not on.
So I return it to Amazon
These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration !! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card. There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality.
I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration !!
Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price. SO why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !
Let's be honest.
This product ain't cheap. It's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working. 
I bought mine at cpenusa.com. Delivery was great, only took them a couple of days. However, my c-pen cable was damaged. The connector to the c-pen was, for some reason, cut in half. Without it, you can't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc.
I called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours. NO RESPONSE. I sent three e-mails to cpenusa. NO RESPONSE.
I don't care if the product itself is great(I'll never know now, will I..). If you're unable to receive support when you need 'em, you're screwed. 
If you're just interested in electronic equipments, just want to try things out and don't really care if you're on your own, go ahead and try it. Let me know how this thing really is. Otherwise, buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support
 I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!
I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.
I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.
The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.
Infocus says "sometimes this happens".
They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-"It is out of warranty", "sometimes this happens", "1400 hours is just what some lamps get", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.
I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.
They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.
Don't buy Infocus!!!
The worst customer service I have ever experienced. The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said:"You got it cheaper than other brands, what else do you expect?" "Viking cheats. So what?
This item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera, but was never delivered. Now Amazon wants me to review it, so here your are..
This is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock.  But it has one major flaw.  The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.
If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good.
Luckily, I didn't pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr. as it was given to us as a "prize." I have the original (manual) SkipDr. which worked every time, and I always end up using it instead. It has more than paid for itself in repaired CD's--$20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang.
The motorized version didn't come with any deep scratch sanding pads, which I need about 25% of the time for a badly scratched disc. Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine, and won't start turning, so I have to squeeze it together to make it work
One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel + button and it did not work straight out of the box.  I returned it.
Beyond that, setting it up takes time but is not difficult.  I am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out
This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off).
I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market. Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product.  These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible "surrounds", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable.  But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say.  Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better
I am disappointed in this product.
I was suppose to write to you from the weekend.
My two rear speakers just stop working, and also my
remote control. I have replace the batteries, but still
does not work.
I don't have any other rear speakers to try on the system.
Pleasy me what to do.
Thank you

while the verbatim has burned well in 100% of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This media did not work on my brand new asus burner, even after updating the firmware
Can capture analog video and produce cd-rom's but I expected the ability to produce DVD
I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD.  Worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi's of the four different devices I have tried.  Completely unusable.  The software is a trial version.  Instead, buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more.  Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version.  It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture.  Pinnacle's Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space, but the software is way too buggy
I got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term, risky cells.
It could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but I'm
not willing to chance it again
If these were free, i'd still would not recommend them, due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings.
It is the discs, I must assume, since my burner works fine with other brands.
Anyway, (now) I think it's best to invest a bit more and get good media..
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS
I had this card for more than 6 months, and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510. Transfers went well too. Then all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting "card error" on my computer and digital camera a week ago. My SD/USB converter couldn't find the card either. I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good. What a joke
I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore. 
This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place.  The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the "hold" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off.  The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod.  I finally just gave up on it and returned it.  I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.  I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options.  Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is "admin". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.
The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine
I ordered the 2-year service plan on May 1st, this day (July 31st), I still have not recievied it. I have contacted them a number of times, and still nothing.  Do not buy from this company
I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork. I emailed and have not received a reply
This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons.
1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub.
2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant
3. It is clunky
4. Does not comke with a power adapte
Wasted my money for this SLOW hub...
Be aware that if you want to connect your printer, scanner, ipod etc. to this device, think again
i purchased the DLO action jacket (neoprene for 20 & 40GB ipods) for my wife for use on walks, etc around town.  However, the ipod doesn't fit in properly.  The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod's doesn't.  The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn't align either so you can't press the play button.  So, since the ipod doesn't fit in the case overall, this product is useless.  pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case
I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.
My recommendation is don't buy this model!!
I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive.  Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room.  The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing.  It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand.  The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live.  This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash.  I won't miss it at all
We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice
I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable.
Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it.
As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly.
I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy..
I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste.
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money.
Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that..
It is absolutely infuriating
I have an Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected.
Pay a little more and buy an IPOD.  It interfaces with PCs and Macs equally well.
First of all, the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself.  I did get it quickly (2 or 3 days), but I had several problems with it:
(1) I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung.  Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond.  I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time.
(2) I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well.  Had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get my DVD player software to close.  On the 3rd attempt it actually did work.
(3) I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer. Each time I got a message saying "no disk".
I consider it item a waste of money
cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money
It is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them.  On the flip side once they have been opened once, they don't reclose very well
Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.
AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW &  CD RW DISKS!
I have the older, larger version of this product. However, it uses the same software. The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great, but the software is awful. There is no direct Macintosh program; rather there are templates. They were written for old versions of software and really don't work right. The Windows side includes an actual Print Shop-style program which works awfully. If you do get this, make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint
They totally misrepresent this product. It does not work with Macs. I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex, shame on you
after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement.  of course you want a hard copy, that is why you bought it. just do it.
Okay,
This is not a review of the product itself. But, I strongly
encourage you to consider not getting an N.E.W warranty. They are
really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things. 
If you had anything to do with the device not working (e.g. you dropped it, forget about it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever.) 
They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginia(of course you have to pay for the shipping!)
Lastly, they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N.E.W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N.E.W will take months to pay them for the work they did.
If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
N.E.W. will waste your time, money, and your every last nerve before repairing your product.  Eventually they will, but not without an exhausting, protracted fight
I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate.  But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker.  I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod.  
Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn't been opened.  So, when was my first clue?  Doh
I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot.  I had such a card for more than a year.  In that period, I used it in my camera.  It's filled up for several times.  Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers.  It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got "CF card error" on my camera.  Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on.  I gave the card to  other people, so I don't know how it's doing now.
After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago.  I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet.  Now I am getting consistent "CF card error" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card.  
One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card.  I can not verify though.  Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time.
===== One month later =====
I contacted with their customer support.  They gave me a number for return, and I mailed back my damaged CF card.  They sent back a new one in a week.  The new one is working fine so far.  The exchange was not difficult.  They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt.  They only verified the serial number.  That's good
I wish they had a rating for zero stars.  I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters.  That's a 24% success rate.  I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters.  Memorex has really gone downhill. 
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether.  I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft.  I've since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it.
Being a graduate student and living in an apartment, I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments.  It prints off things quite well and it is fast.  It does not, however, print 500 pages per month.  50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $20, which is high considering how often you need to buy them.
The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition. 
This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that?
Now I can't use it at all....
I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now.
Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products.
Buyers beware...
I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media, software etc.- I'd been using Ridata for some time w/ next to no coasters but figured I'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around. Big mistake. They skip, pixelate and freeze up. I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies I've done. Were it a compatibility issue I could understand, but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media. I'm going back to using my cheap disks! 
The lesson here is: " If it works, dont fix it!
I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said &quot;it IS ON!!&quot; This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD.
Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer. I wasnt impressed. I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!! Many of my CDs I have replaced for $7-10 bucks on here. I wish I wouldve kept my $25
Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again. It worked right most of the time, but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button. I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to "reset" and work correctly.  It's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working.
Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand
Hi! I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006, and was able to set the region code to "0" to watch all DVD's. 
After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks (and unplugging it), the region code has automatically set back to "1" and I cannot change it anymore! What happened?? When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings "1" and "-". Anyone who has the same problem? Thank yo
As with some of the other reviewers, mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter.  I bought a Vector brand inverter at Wal-Mart and it is much better
AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME.  THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOOD
The sound was great, but the DVD would lag every 10-15 seconds during any and all movies.  It drove me nuts. I had to return it.
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics.  I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and  A. Isaicu all talke about these problems
The Good:
When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited.  I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. 
The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen.  But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it.
The Bad:
The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard.  The "Windows Keyset" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard). 
In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M  keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little "cheap" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much.
The Ugly:
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead.  I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail.
I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH!  They are "reviewing my warranty" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit.
Conclusion:
The expression "Great Idea, Bad Execution" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good
It was a great product when it worked.  Sleek design, super user friendly, sharp image and easily unlock to all region.  Never had any problem loading or playing until last week.  Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie.  Swallowed the DVD with it.  It would've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them.  That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go.  We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash.  Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping.  This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste.  Save your time and money and buy another machine
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice
I bought these thinking they were a good deal but now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. I bought 24 of these and one year later I have four left that will take any sort of charge. The ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each. I also have several high end chargers that don't want anything to do with the ones that died. On the bright side I have several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been A+ after 2+ years
O.k., I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now.  These batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives.  I don't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is, but these didn't last being on the shelf for a little over a year.  I will never buy this brand again
To be short, the performance is less than great but OK, but I can live with that since I have dozens of them, I don't care if it runs out faster. But what I couldn't stand if that it also set my charger on fire since one of them leaked, I couldn't imagine what would happen if I didn't come to my desk in time
I bought this as a travel charger for my Blackberry. All I can say is awful, awful, awful. I followed instructions in the manual (which are pretty easy) and charged up the Solio. After waiting twice as long as required, I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it charged--big mistake. Not only did it not charge a weird red "battery" icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed.
I tried this routine several times over several days with the same result, rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous. Finally, I had enough and told the customer service for Solio that I was returning it. Not only did they never return my money (I had to call my CC company to handle it) no one ever said what the problem could be.
My advice: Stay away from this thing--it may seen cool or environmentally friendly, but it is junk a piece of over-priced junk
C. Musselman can add 2 more cards to his connector problem.  I have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna - I plan to return it all.  Avoid this product
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all. I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer. Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while. It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD. Apparently Sony didn't do proper quality testing on this product. I returned mine and after these other reviews won't be replacing it with a Sony. I hope this is a message to Sony. 
There are brands I trust and ones I don't.  Sony has always been a trusted brand.  But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken.  I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchase, but because this unit is a Sony I trusted it would be a superior product.  The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews: When playing CDs in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a CD and quitting.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changer.  I am hoping I have better luck.
I recently bought my second of these. The first had a digital tuner. You had to get used to the feel. After about a year of use, one earphone went out. The one I just bought has an analogue tuner, and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop (and around here, country) stations. The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial. I can't believe Sony is charging $40.00 for this cheap piece of junk
I bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks. But, I soon found that it does not work well. After a few uses the gears began to stick. It would no longer crush/shave ice. Stick with the smaller units
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes.
As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing. 
Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough
My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me. I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week. Then the colors started to change. Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them, such as yellow faces and hands, no proper flesh tones. 
I call HP support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured, not the purchase date. I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had. I was given a case number, but when I called HP back stating my case number, they said that this was no longer a free call. I explained it was an extension of the first call, but they refused to work with me.
I think HP warranty policy stinks, and would not purchase another HP product as long as this policy stands. 
This DVR works ok.  But when it is recording, forget about changing channels.  It is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks. 
Broadband feature is nice; but USB doesn't come cheap. Its like [...].  
A clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use....I don't think so.  I have the older models (CD & Clock Radio) and they are nice but the new model is irritating. 
 I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system.  I can't keep a system that I have to locate a remote to operate.

I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES, HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK. I AM A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR. I DEPEND ON MY RADIO TO RAISE HELP. BUT, I AM AFRAID THIS ONE WILL NOT BE DEPENDABLE. I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING;

This carrying case worked well for me until I jumped in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it, causing my iPod to fall to the pavement.  It turns out the clip isn't fastened on all that securely
for $20 bucks...After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up, I still can't get more than a -20db signal from my guitar...Save your money..
I bought one of these modules for my dell 700m. Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen. I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasn't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only! I wouldn't recommend this memory for dell 700m users. 
I wish I had read the problems and netgear.com forums before purchasing this product.
Huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily. This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP in order for it to stay visable to your computers.
Second problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare, and even at 3-5feet from the AP the unit is around 11-36mpbs.
Do not buy this product, find another company who stands behind there products. All of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in India. People on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke. Latest firmware fixes none of the problems
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again
This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over.  We thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery didn't help.  Don't buy this item.  I am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years.  While some Linksys units have worked for me, more often I have found them undependable.  In particular, the WPS54GU2 set up fine, but I almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time I printed.  Not worth the hassle
My drive FAIL after one year and a half...!!! This company really suck BIG TIME....I lost all of my data ...!!! ALL OFF IT...!!! THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR!!!  Total JUNK...!!! NEVER buy a LACIE AGAIN FOR SURE....MAXTOR EXTERNAL IS THE BEST!!
I bought this HD because my Lacie (which had lasted over 5 years) crashed on me finally. So I figured I would try a different company. Out of the box this  product looked great, although it was very large and heavy. I immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up - however that was the one and only time that it booted. I tried several more times and it wouldn't boot up. VERY VERY scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it won't boot up out of the box. I don't know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked - but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data. Going back to Lacie
I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon. Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone. I record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this. But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike. The gain was lower than the ordinary mike, it doesnt work at all without the battery, but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory. Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who'll entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain. :&lt;..
DOES NOT WORK ON VISTA.  SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with Vista upgrade (save for the Windows startup music).  I thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back.  Might have, but it says not compatible with Vista.  I guess I'll be getting a new computer.  :
are you serious?  I bought this a while ago to see if it was cool. It is a piece of junk, u can barely get any channels, and even if you do, you can barely see them and it has loud static.  dont buy it its garbage
The screen is too small. if you want to watch it in your car, you have to cover it because the back light is too week.
The item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks. I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised. once I got the tv up it is ok, and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should  for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady. I did find out there is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks. I had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when I got a replacement. Now it looks like I may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also.This whole thing with the mount and tv has been very frustrating.

These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blank media I've EVER encountered! They're made by CMC Magnetics -- well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world. But not only are they CMC Magnetics, they're the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics!
The latest KProbe *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset. The latest Nero Burning ROM *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset. The program continues, non-stop, to display "waiting for media" when I use these, and an attempt to abort hangs Windows XP SP2 the same way it hangs Kprobe.
Curiously, the media IDs on these are exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CD-R media (they're made by CMC Magnetics as well). However, at least the Philips are recognized by all my software and hardware, quite unlike the Verbatims. That's why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics. (The Philips are no prize, either, but they perform minimally well).
The *ONLY* thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling.  But what's the point of labeling discs you can't even RECOGNIZE, let alone burn?
I had the exact same problems with these media in both my Lite-On LH-201AH burner and my NEC ND-2510A burner (the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even low-quality media).
Note that Verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden. But, stupidly, they chose to go ultra-cheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp. Thus, they lost all credibility!
*AVOID THESE LIKE THE PLAGUE!*
YMMV, but my 80GB drive died after 6 months.  I found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home, but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of.  I'm glad I back up my data in more than one place
This product looks and feels very flimsy. Do not be fooled by the flashy, metallic-looking picture. The plastic shell of this device is the quality of McDonald's toys. One would think that for $300, the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting. 
The buttons are hard to press. In order to turn the device on, you have to press very firmly, which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell.
The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy, and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads  to take place; otherwise, the connection will be lost. 
I am a pre-medical student, and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product, believing that I could (for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk) scan my science textbooks in the library, including the colored diagrams, and in that way, I thought I would make back my investment, since textbooks go for at least $100 each. However, I now see that this belief was naive, to say the least. The Docupen is extremely difficult to use. The words come out distorted, like a jammed fax machine, and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDF's, the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate.
Furthermore, downloading is very slow (at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer), and since you can't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer, you will have to re-scan about 80% of pages due to stretches, smudges, blurriness, suspicious blank spots, and general illegibility.
I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product. I would have saved myself a lot of money and time.
If you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents, then this product may work okay for you, although a digital camera will probably deliver better results. If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out "paperless" with this product, you will find yourself extremely disappointed. 
Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer, it will not a good buy. The idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential, especially when coupled with a Tablet PC. However, the execution of the idea needs improvement. I hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years, at a price that is comparable to quality.
This product is a sad joke.  It's expensive of course.  The paper is just heavyweight paper that's perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves... which takes some effort (not sure if it'd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board).  But, whatever.  
However, the software is crap.  That's the appropriate term.  Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious time.  No you can't make the template show right-side up.  That's right... to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS.  I'm not kidding!  I guess you could also turn your monitor on it's side.  You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should.  But when you edit it, it'll be sideways again.  So you'll have to turn your head (or monitor) back and forth sideways.  What kind of company would sell such a product? 
And oh yeah... if you're looking for templates for the DVD Inserts?  ... nada.  They're not there! 
FYI: This does not fit the new generation 5.5 of ipods (80 GB). Another thing is that there isn't a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd
I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work
After about 3 weeks of operation, the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy.  Looking for a better option
I bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved, however I have fought with the drivers for days now. Whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work, if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes (even with the newest updates) I will be returning this product ASAP. I'm very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again! 
I only wish there was a 0 star revie
This was my second Netgear product I bought (previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed)  The idea of a network storage appeals to me.  But this drive just is not good.  
 
In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing, and be careful on the drives you buy for it.  Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday. 
 
Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well, but that is where everything started to go down hill.  Midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages (which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors) and suddenly my computer reboots.  Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well, and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot.  Tried again, same thing happens.  Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101, you need to look in to your own computer.  To quote Netgears web site, "SCSI disk drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers. Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives. Many newer computers use Promise SATA drivers."
My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers.  Back in the box the SC101 goes, and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me.  Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests, and none work.  This is where I get really frustrated, Netgear support.  I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, who ultimately told me it was my own fault and I'd have to pay to have that "cr*p", yes he said it, from my system.  I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill.  I have to pay to get this junk off my computer.  Way to support your products Netgear.  The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand, and went through huge mood swings during the call, from happy, to argumentative, to depressed, to happy again.  I was freaked that this person knew my home address!
 
All in all, this is a great concept.  After reading up on it and now experiencing it, I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market.  Maybe by a company with better customer service.  It really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
Range is very weak probably less than half a mile. Don't waste your money
everything works fine except for two flaws in Excel: on the numpad, the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key.  this is unacceptable, i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games.  logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products, but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings.  i will never buy logitech again
I live in San Francisco and have generally good radio reception.  This unit could not receive normal FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up... and I used the fancy "Dipole" antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna.
The HD part of the radio is total junk.  Sometimes the audio "skips" and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired (meaning 3 or 4 second drop-outs.)
All in all, there's nothing good about this radio.  Don't buy it.
de K0UNX.  I know radios.
I purchased the Recepter Radio HD a year ago, used it for a weekend and returned it immediately.  Even in the Denver market, with lots of very strong HD signals, this radio had trouble finding them.  I'd be listening to a strong station, and the radio would lose lock, go silent, and rebuffer before coming back to life.  This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it.  I have since purchased a Sangean HDR-1 and love it.  Read my review under the Sangean HDR-1
Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista.  Got this message: "One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it."  The mini-disk that came with it was no help.  No response from Tiger Direct.  Went to Radio Shack and got one.  It works
After one successful printing it didn't work at all. My printer is HP deskjet 712C. This cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected
What more can I say than the above?  It is flimsy, doesn't stay in adjustment, rattles around when you move, and looks cheap to boot.  Don't waste your money, this thing is junk. It would be more appropriately priced at $5.00.
Tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world.  It's just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot.  Mine broke in 2 different spots within a month..
There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives. For me I consider them annoyances but not killers. I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it. More memory is always good but the T5 isn't on the hurting side. It's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has. And even if you have a 2G card with mp3's it's not like this is what you would buy for MP3s. But as far as contact information, on the go applications etc.. I would consider this as good as any other. The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die. I haven't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die. It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to even a factory state. You will have a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top. 
There are a couple of fixes. If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make it better. Or you can remove the battery and solder it back. This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for.
Until I ran into this I would have rated this a 4/5. Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do. I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi. But it has one of the fastest processors (available at that time) in a PDA. Which was a different type of cool. The bluetooth
works well enough I haven't had any issues with it. You can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn't really that big of a deal.
But if you can't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really 
doesn't matter what cool feature it has. This has been a very expensive let down.
I don't want to buy another Palm after this experience but I am not sure what to
switch to...
First T5 lasted 6 months, then just refused to start - was replaced under warranty. This one locked up after about 3 months - was replaced again under warranty. The third T5 lasted about 5 months. It's now out of warranty and won't start or reset. No - I'm not rough on my PDAs. None of them got even as much as a scratch. Each one looked like new when it "broke". The first 2 times, Palm told me the ROM had failed. I guess it's the same problem again, but I'm not spending $169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5. Good bye Palm.
Out of the box I think it's a good PDA, so check those 4 and 5 star reviews to see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy
I bought this headset from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine.
However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are "uncomfortable as sin". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return. 
If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere..
I dont recommend these for 1st person shooter gamers.
Impossible to tell if enemy is in front or behind you.
Probably ok if direction of sound is not important to you.
Left and right work ok but not front/rear for some reason.
My hp laptop earbuds work better
The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless. On battery the radio works very well, just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost.
Invest in batteries rather than this product.
I bought this card and the Belkin Pre-N wireless router in Nov. 2006 at a BestBuy store during Thanksgiving sale. The router worked but the card did not. I called Belkin many times. Everytime they asked me to re-install the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked. I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and re-installing drivers again and again. Then finally Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement. I pointed out that I should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs. I have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th.   I wouldn't waste my time ordering this product from Amazon
THIS SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE INK CARTRIDGE I NEED. #78 TRI COLOR FOR MY HP 750
Dear Sir/Madam: Its very difficult to email you regarding things I can't find.! Or you don't sell? I am looking for HP black ink. #20 for 656C printer. Now, you tell me which ink I need? No way you can tell.!! Because you are NOT selling or what? You site is very difficult to find Ink I need
Overall I don't like it. When the screen is black between scenes and what not, their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference. Buy a different one, this one is just not up to the task
I ordered the A1500 and received the A1000. I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedback on this page. I didn't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed (as the other fellow did below). Amazon is usually pretty good, not this time, and not on this product.

I ordered the Cobra HG A1500 High Gear CB Antenna. They keep sending the Cobra HG A1000. Now I'm stuck with a antenna I did not order nor do I want.
This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad's new tracheostomy.  Problem is, it puts out TOO much mist even at the lowest setting!  We've tried everything including taping the hole, but it then goes from 'all' to 'nothing' because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through. Of course it wasn't until we started mentioning it to the various RN's that come to take care of my dad that 'everyone' using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem.  So... I've resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad's mask.  Not a great way to do it (and just asking to be seeded by bacteria), but if anyone has a better suggestion, I'm all for it, even if it means suggesting a different humidifier..
O.K., so I'm paying $300 for a set-top box with a 40Gb hard drive, but I can't use it as a DVR? Why not? Also, the only content I can play on this set-top box is content that comes through iTunes? That's right. if it isn't in your iTunes library, you can play it on the Apple TV. This means you caqn play your DVD's, you cant't play saved DVD, iMovie, or other movie files, you can't play anything unless it has been successfully;y added to your iTunes library. Also, make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV. they aren't joking about this. If you don't have one, you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen (it won't go to the edges and be borderless) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box. 
Any pros? It has to be the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item. I mean less than 5 minutes and I was set. also, I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part, it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes  just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computer was also plugged into. basically, Apple TV saw this is a direct link. I didn't think it would be that easy without having to configure something, but it was. Also the menus are very helpful and attractive. This will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability. Right now it's time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better. if this had only cost me $100 or $150 I would probably keep it, however. $300 is too much for too little
The left palm pad keep peeling, possibly from the uneven heat.
This make the protection pad a lot less useful than one would
think, which is most people buy this pack fo
Not very happy with this product.
The software on the pc side doesn't work well at all.
Won't list all my files and I can't get it to update changes or new folders.
This bugger has way to big of a foot print.
The remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies.
Hey I have a Xbox with XBMC on it. Get a clue, and copy some of it's functionality. It continues to blow away any of the media players I have purchased
I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.
  First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.  
  I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless.
  I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully.
  I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here.
  1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing.
  2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh!
This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning.
My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!!
My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks.
Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right.
One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead.
I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway.
And I was right....I should have passed on this.  It was a pain to configure, and then none of the settings would stick.  Whenever I changed the default password, it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset.  That kind of defeats the point.  Returning this item so I can get something decent.  The money saved is NOT worth it
bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product. ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything, neither did anyone answer the phones. i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it. im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help
You'll end up looking for something better.  Sound fidelity is pretty bad. 
There's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks.  It's absolute junk.  I put it into the cassette player in my car, and the sounds were completely distorted.  The voice constantly skips, and the casette sometimes clicks.  The quality of sound in my car is usually amazing, and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device.  I've tried both sides, but still no avail.  I plan on returning it if shipping doesn't cost more than the product itself
I have a DCS-900W camera that failed within a year. After that, I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced. Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that don't seem to care about the "service" that much, and usually after a couple of transfers, the line got cut off or picked up by another layman. During conversation, the line quality is very bad.
After a while, I just decided that $100 camera is not worth the time of the calls. I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau.
Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from D-Link. Once you have any problem, they just won't honor the waranty
I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons.  First, I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt.  That wasn't such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve.  But then I went to wear it for a run, and the arm-band was too small for my arm!  I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training, but nothing outrageous.  I would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users.  This is unfortunately not the case.  So if you have larger than average biceps (say 17" amd up), save your money...
i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness (&lt;100%). just scheduled an exchange LCD
After having installed the unit for 43 days, the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting.  This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit "Flying"! Very dangerous!!
Tomtom would not replace the unit, as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks! buyer beware.  See the TomTom forum for description and picture:

and other links to the base issue
I ordered this television with high hopes, knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle.  But you get what you pay for.  Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1, 2006 shipped with bad firmware.  What does this mean to you?
For me, it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on, it turned itself off and never turned back on again.  Resets, system resets, power cycling, unplugging components didn't help.  My TV was completely bricked.  A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase.  For them, the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV.  I say a "visit" because Sharp does not cover in-house technician visits for TVs under 32", a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled.
So here I am, 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it.  Instead, it sits at the authorized service center (because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either).
I'm willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4/1/2006.  Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one.  If it begins with a 501-512, 601, 602 or 603, immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp (1-800-BE-SHARP), regardless of whether or not you're experiencing these issues; you will eventually, and hopefully while Sharp's warranty is still in effect for you.
i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen, i sent it back and it has been 2-3 months & i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit
I have not been able to get this to work again. It was great for the first week, then it made my computer crash and now I cannot get it installed again. I am not sure I like that
I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase.  Boy was I wrong.  Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware, software, or other products like this one.  Now having problems with the product is one thing, but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats [...].  Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month.  My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months, I did get it to work again.  Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems.  OK, so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem, no go.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone.  
Save yourself some frustration and get something better.  iriver maybe?  Just stay away from Creative Lab products. 
I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it.  It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months.  The firmware decided to stop recognizing songs, albums titles, and eventually that there was even any music to listen to.  Now I have a 200$ dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PC.  Customer service? Don't count on it.  So if your into extensively troubleshooting, highly frustrating, pieces of junk, this is a great product. 
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - I have purchased seven, but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case, note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' -- NOT!
5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you don't need one
a virtual nightmare with set up. no help from their support staff on phones, nor online Q&A. poorest choice i ever have made in a product!!
I am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books. Item still sitting where i left it......., useless
This product has a known defect for serial numbers R641 and less (see Logitech website). I just received my Amazon Order  and it was serial number R635. It will be sent back tomorrow. Hopefully, Amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own, rather than relying on its customer base
These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out. Voices are muted, highs are muddy, and lows are non-existant. The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as "surround sound" (yeah right...) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers.
Maybe mine was broken, but I don't think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends. I connected the splitter to my sound card, a TB Montego DDL, with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo. No signal whatever. Both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card. I even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad. Still no signal.
I think you need to have either a very, very, strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one, or use a powered splitter.
Cheap and definitely nasty - they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear-cups, but after a few months light use, I lost sound through one cup then the other. In general - when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on. The batteries seemed to last pretty long though - actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself. Very disappointing, but for the price, this is hardly unexpected
I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works.  Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise.  My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them).  the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy.  I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well
It is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor.  Buying this handheld was a big mistake
I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month.  It just suddenly wouldn't turn on.  Amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days, before even getting the original back.  But the replacement model "froze up" after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund.  To quote an e-mail from Amazon regarding this product "As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than 
we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."  So, DO NOT order one!
This would be a nice printer.  If only I could get it to print!  Not to mention when I turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed.  I've tried over and over to try to print something.  I've checked my options, turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing.  If your looking for a portible printer you have other options and I suggest using them
This is just a general review, of all DVD cases. I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs. I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years, and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks, so DVD's is your only source of video entertainment. My collection grew to more than 400. I have been trying to find a good case, that hold equal number of title books as it does DVD's. But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????  Then when you look at the furniture options, everything seems to be made for function, and not style at all, they are generally pressboard P.O.S's and nothing I would want to keep in my garage.......... I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions, cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied!!!!!
This product will not fix your disc, I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problem worse.  I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor.  This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work, I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it
I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1.5 feet onto a hardwood floor.  The unit has a very cheap feel, especially for the price.  I wasn't at all surprised when it stopped working.  The PC software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap.  The touchscreen is very tedious to customize (I write software for a living, and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen).  I can't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit, given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PC to the remote.  The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touch screen.  Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications, do not buy this unit.  Aside from the touchscreen's fagility, is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small, given the size of the remote.  Did I mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months?  In short, this product is crap.  I might consider buying another one if it sold for $30 or less
Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working. 
Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.
I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution
Like other users have experienced, this unit is no longer functional after 18 months.  The wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights.  Poor product Netgear
I was given the iQue M3 for Christmas of 2005. A few months into the new year, I dropped it onto pavement, and it broke. For $99, Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit, which I consider a fair price. Unfortunately, the refurb unit couldn't play directions at full volume, so I returned it for another refurb. This unit fell off the windshield still in it's cradle, and it started making that frying sound of short circuits. I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit, they'd look at it under warranty. I had told the guy what happened, so I was pleasantly surprised; they did, in fact, replace it.
Under all circumstances, the report you get back says the returned unit was "within specifications" (or words to that effect), even though clearly not. I have no idea why. Units will be returned with new software keys to enter, and the software will begin urging you to register, even though you already have.
For some, the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled. It is a basic drive from here to there unit. It does not allow you to load way-points, Points of Interest, and the like.
Each of the units had quirks. On the first one, every time I inserted the SD card with maps, Windows player (or whatever it's called) would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes. The second one had inaudible volume. The fourth one has a problem common to the first one: The brightness resets itself randomly to zero. Yep, zero. The first one left the powered brightness full on, so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on, but this one resets them both to zero. So you may think the unit is not turning on, but it's on. You just can't see anything on the screen. If you're outside, you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting, but if it's dark, you need a flashlight.
The current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle. This means I have to do the full new user routine. Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone. After I've gone through the restart routine, the unit will then find the satellites and get me where I'm going, but I can't load destinations from contacts, as they're gone, so I have to type them all in by hand.
If the battery runs out of juice, the unit is dead. It forgets everything, and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone.
I complained about this to support at Garmin, and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it. They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost. So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data. I did learn, though, that if the battery runs down, the backup program is lost, so you can't retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives. I learned it the hard way, of course.
To restore, I pop out the detailed maps SD card, insert the backup card, navigate to the File Explorer, navigate to the SD card, open the contents of the SD card, select the latest back up, click through the restore procedure, click to OK that it has finished (just a minute or two with my small amount of data), click to restart, wait a long time for it to restart, tap to get past the owner data screen, enter the password, then pop the restore card out, reinstall the map card, wait while it reads it, then I'm good to go. I can't do it while I'm driving, of course, so if the unit resets on its own, I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where "Home" is, which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue.
The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up, which is confusing for me as I can't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am vis-a-vis the map. I'm sure this is my shortcoming, and I then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up, which I can't do while driving. It also defaults to different displays for day and night. The night display uses a dark background, and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text. So I can't read the menu selections against the dark display. And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle.
On the contacts database, the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. It also formats all numbers as US numbers. I have a few overseas numbers, and they are crammed into the (xxx) xxx-xxxx format, even though they are longer and don't start with an area code.
In the calendar, if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone, I enter them at the time they're scheduled. Then when I get there, I have the option of choosing the visited time zone, and all the times are screwed up, as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone. So I never use the visited time zone feature, and the unit assumes I'm still in my home zone wherever I may travel.
I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address, but for which I have the lat/long coordinates. I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out, which loses the road. 
On the whole, the directions part of the M3 is excellent. It gives good directions, has reasonably up to date maps, and lets you find stores, restaurants, gas stations, hotels, and the like in your area, and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations. 
On the whole, using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper. After a year of use, I can't put up with it anymore. I'll take Garmin's word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmin's fault, but I can't put up with it anymore. I'll switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isn't Windows-based and that doesn't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down, doesn't randomly do a hard reset, doesn't randomly set the brightness to zero, and doesn't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and way-points from other people's files
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have Directv with HD (5 LNB) and the signal was low. Signal was less than 60% for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD. So I bought these to amplify my satellite signal.  They actually attenuated the signal. The signal strength wasn't improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well. It didn't matter where I put them in relation to the dish and receiver.
The headphones sound great--no arguement there.  However, I was removing the plastic tips (which need to be changed every several months) and the headphones broke.  The company has only a one-year warranty so I was out-of-luck.  Again, I thought the sound was great, but for this price I would expect them to be more durable...I was hardly touching them when they broke off.
Also, the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times
Just received radio yesterday, and am returning radio today! Pluses.... adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter. Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set "numbered" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a "null" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead. Eton E-5, not bad, but certainly not worth 3 stars or above, especially, if comparing it to another similar size radio, and then comparing it to my Sony 2010. 
This item is an all around piece of garbage. After about 3 months of light use, it is stuck in 45 rpm mode. I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode. Don't buy this piece of garbage, unless you like owning garbage, in which case this is right your alley, the Garbage Alley. I wouldn't even give this to a bum, because I would feel bad about it.
did not work - never clicked
no tech support
waste of good mone
After buying this product, I opened the case after few days, as I was out of country, to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices. However every time I put it in the camera or other devices, it gives error and doesn't work. I couldn't use this memory stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receipt,I  am not sure how I can even return it back either. Basically not at all happy with the product at this time
The light makes my computer very sluggish, even when my laptop is not running off of the battery.  Browsing the internet, especially, is painfully slow, and I am on a high-speed cable connection
After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my "M" tape was providing. I opted for this "TZ" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to "narrow". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the "narrow" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another "great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so. I really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars! You have been warned
We bought this phone two years ago.  While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features (I've especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets), we've found it to be extremely unreliable.  The problems we've had are listed below:
*very short battery life for the handsets
*the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use
*the handsets go "out of range" when one takes them only a modest distance from the base (even though we have the base in the middle of our house, the handsets don't work at the ends-- and our house is not that big)
*the handsets randomly become "unregistered" from the base and have to be reset (this has only become a problem in the past month)
The issues we've had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone-- usually we'd expect such a purchase to last longer than two years
I bought this phone for the great features and because I've had good luck with other Motorola products. The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have. The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit. The only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings. Range on the handsets is only mediocre, I can't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located. Also, battery life is very limited. Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend not buying them.
Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout house because Patricia (wife) in wheelchair and on oxygen 24/7. She could beep all phones in emergency and I would hear. First- sound terrible, second- after 1 month most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls, third- phones quite often in 'searching' mode when picked up for use. Entered house to find wife unconcious and not breathing. Started CPR and reached for phone to call 911. Phone in base beside her was
SEARCHING!!!!!!! Stopped CPR and ran to another room for different brand phone and called 911. Resumed CPR. Patricia DIED in spite of my and 911 personnel's efforts. Looking for someone I hate to give these 5 phones, my last Motorola product
It didn't match the Acoustic Wave player I bought. There should have been also two outdoor speakers, as a promotion for buying both pieces.
The page, from which I ordered both pieces, was unclear, and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer.
 
I had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player. (I know I'll be refunded the price of the first changer). But by then, the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished. I received the real changer a few days later, but lost the speakers. I think Amazon owes me the speakers, which is what the bad page made me miss
In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent.
I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems
Bought 4 ! They don't work. The batteries do not last. We are trying to return them
After using these radios two months I can say that battery life is poor.A full charge doesn't hold three hours.Perhaps my batteries didn't come in good condition. I didn't use them on AAA yet... 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment, open sea or desert perhaps.Product works fine while battery las
After receiving this DRUM which was listed as having a 25,000 yield capacity, on 12/11/06....Today 1/15/07 my printer is giving me the same error message "DRUM NEAR END"   There was no indication when I purchased this product that it would be refurbished..I certainly have NOT printed 25,000 copies...
The transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do
I knew better, but I did it anyway, thinking that it would be a good compromise (we have IBM, Dell, and Toshiba laptops and a Sony Really Nice Monitor).  No modem port (not a surprise, but would have been nice), the video display is, well, you can see stuff on the monitor.  One of the USB ports isn't reliable.  I could go on, but you get the picture.  Don't bother
Every other negative review here is accurate.  The video connection is horrible.  The mouse runs on a delay of 1-2 seconds and is unacceptable.  Try the competing Kensington product instead.  It's more expensive, but it works.  I switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly - in short, as advertised and expected
I tried 3 of these DVD+Rs, none of them worked, errors in every burn. I used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly, so it is definately a problem with these DVD+Rs and not with my burner
i've come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse. the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface, and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser won't track right. i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didn't test it well enough. unless your willing to do that skip this one, it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice. i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul. but then again you do get what you pay for :
Bought it for my Nokia N80 and it doesn't work...typical! Shouldn't have bought a generic memory!! Serves me right! Anyway..
I purchased this product and couldn't get it to work on a PC, laptop, or pda (cingular 8125). Not only does it not register in any SD/MiniSD card reader, but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well. I am currently pursuing a refund
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD, (one fewer thing to carry).  Well, about six months after opening this item, I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery.  One of the contacts had broken, and the device was not working anymore.  I am disappointed, but should have expected that for the $10 I spent. 
The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews. I was never able to get the card to do anything. I tried removing and reinstalling the drivers. I tried getting assistance through the web site. I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call. I've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card
Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wear, and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface.
I just couldnt suggest anyone else spent $15 on a mousepad that isnt going to last them
I put this cover on immediately after I opened my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratch.  I've never had my iPod without the cover on it and have had it 3 weeks.  I now have an iPod covered with distracting scratches on the screen.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  THIS CASE IS JUNK
Have a second Generation ipod?  If so, this is not the product for you.  After buying my new green ipod I needed something to protect it, so I bought the "Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster."  It just didn't fit it.  I tried, but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off:  don't do this.  I sugest making sure the product detail includes the "second generation.
Do not order this item, if you want a DVD player with a 5 inch screen.  This item is not as pictured.  You will receive a small orange colored player with a 3.5 inch screen
We had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam. We would get an error message, and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while. We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program, after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor. (The tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them) We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again. The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount, and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam. Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth, and for now the unit is working. We still haven't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem. I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally. I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years, but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position. Also, HP tech support is very difficult to deal with at best. I talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible English. I am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported. HP are you listening
Easy setup, but who cares, when the end result is a very slow video.  Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movie "The Mask". When he whips his head from side to side and you see the "blur", THAT'S what you see with this webcam! Don't waste your money. I'm sending it back tomorrow!
This sucker couldn't pick up a single channel; not even one less than 10 miles away.  I live in a fairly open area
The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove.  I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time.  I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod.  In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system.  I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking
Although the RS receiver doesn't have TV reception (who cares),
it is 1/2 the price, PLL digital, 3" speaker, DX/LOC switch, and
probably much better quality..
Bought it for my wife - the pink just didn't match anything in my wardrobe...
She uses her player for the gym, and treats it somewhat rough.  This "case" doesn't protect the screen from scratches (see most other reviews), but it hasn't fallen off while she's worn it, either.  About 1/2 useful, really.
On the other hand....it was cheap, right?  Right?
The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection. It is nice that it has a clip, and it fits the mp3 player snugly, but... Would be nice if it has a clear "window" to protect the screen
According to SysInternal's Process Explorer, both HWI (hardware interrupts) and DPC (deferred procedure calls) tend to run to 3%-40% each while this card is installed; both drop to under 1% once it's removed. Both remain under 1% while using another manufacturer's (USB-based) 802.11/b WiFi adapter. I'm given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers, but I've found no useful driver update info on D-Link's web site, last I looked. That other /b adapter, BTW, gives better throughput than this /b/g card of D-Link's
Does not consistently work! I have a toshiba a15 (Win XP Pro) and sometimes this works, but usually it doesn't. Lately, it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer. It used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found, which forced me to reload the driver. But lately it's just been giving me a blue screen. I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues.
D-Link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver! Bad customer service!
I WILL NEVER BUY A D-LINK PRODUCT AGAIN!!
I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse. I do not have the original packaging otherwise I would have taken in back. The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back, I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card. After a week of use the mouse started to wig-out. Erratic movement etc. If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time I cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons. The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scroll. The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver. I thought this was because I was using a Mac, I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well. I'm going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemy
This item was not practical. It looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
Overall this item works as expected, but requires to be reset (i.e. cycle the power) once every 24-48 hours.
I will be replacing it with another model
The ends are comming off this cable doesn't meet the normal Belkin standards
We got the hdmi cables, but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website.  The cables come without any packaging, and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website.
We have not yet used the cables yet, and we're not sure whether they will work or not
Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C, the battery discharges quickly and won't take a full charge.
I've removed the driver, with no change.  The next step was to do a hard reset of the Tungsten C and I'm hoping it will take charge.
I'm taking this keyboard back for a full refund
It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC. 
I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it. 
Very disappointing
Works fine on Windows XP, but does not work well with Linux.  I've been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time, and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux.  My built in 10/100 NIC was much faster than this card would go.  Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that, of course, works with no issues.  Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box. 
I just bought these to compare to my pair of V20s, and they just suck in comparison.
The Bass is non existent in comparison, and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny. Any sort of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion. 
I'm usually a fan of Altec Lansing products, but...
These look nice and are compact, but the sound is not good, at all. The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling...
I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer.  Since most new computers use USB for serial interface, the usefulness of this unit is limited.  My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product.
I would not have bought it had I known this.  I have not used the GPS since I bought it.  It will probably be tossed out.
The serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package.  So you don't see it prior to opening the package.  Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned.
Lastly, this is one of the worst packaging jobs I have seen.  The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors.  The cut plastic is also dangerous
I have this radio and it's a POS. Remote isn't very responsive and the display is WAAaay too bright (will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person) and the user interface is terrible. The thing gets lousy reception and in general, there is a reason why this is always the lower priced iPod type radio on websites. They are trying to get rid of it because it s_cks!!!!!!
I bought this alarm clock today (April 7, 2007) at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $10.  I wish I had seen the reviews first.  I bought it because of the product name, small size and variety of options.  Unfortunately, I realized it wasn't a great buy when I brought it home...and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on.  The connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery doesn't stay in place.
   The clock light is pointless.  It's supposed to help you see the time in the dark, but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry.  Actually, the screen is blurry in most positions  even with the light off.
   As for the alarm, it's pretty quiet.  If you're a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment, this is not the clock for you.  You'll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear.
  A final note on this product: The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems...but only with the battery cover slightly open.  If I close the cover all the way, the clock shuts off.  If you want an alarm clock that will last awhile, I suggest buying something else.  You get less than you pay for with this model.
I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time
I had a 1GB Titanium Sandisk Cruzer at work fail.  I tried several times to contact Sandisk, including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response.
My wife's Cruzer just failed as well (the power light comes on, it is recognized by XP, and the light goes out, the system can't ID the device, so it's useless.  It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our house).  I've tried front side USB connections, rear connections and hub connections.  No dice.  
I'll never buy another Sandisk Cruzer.  And I was going to order another 100 for the office.  Their loss
SURE THESE FLOPPY'S ARE INEXPENSIVE...THEY ARRIVED ON TIME...THANKS AMAZON!!!!!  BUT THE PHOTO DOESN'T GIVE IT ANY CREDIT...THESE DON'T COME WITH A PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO...JUST A CRAPPY CARDBOARD BOX! COME ON GUYS....WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS, NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices (all had the same description and specs).  It worked for about 2 weeks, and then quit.  A friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette, which had come loose. Since then it has come loose twice more, so I just don't use it anymore.  When it worked, it worked fine, but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution
I just purchased this item -  now I'm planning to return it tomorrow.  One of the advertised features, the ability to store liner notes just doesn't work properly.  They just don't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in.  To me, the liner notes have value and I'm not willing to fold, spindle, or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up. The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio. I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right. 
I cannot comment on the reception as the antenna is broken!
Overall, it's a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials.
Machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing. Showed it to a repair shop, says the fuser is a toast. Replacement cost part and labor $300. Died just after one year so have to bear the expense. Poor design/quality. Beware, i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem
our MFC - 8840DN worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that couldn't be fixed by the sales technician.  Lots of waiting for a response from Brother at their call in website.  They waited out the warrenty.  Will never buy from Brother or Amazon again as a result of this
The buttons don't have that clicky button feel, so you press and you're like "did it go?"... The labels are hard to read, icons take a little figuring out. Honestly I use it for turning on/off, and if I want to do anything else I go up to the iHome to adjust it.
My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod Video.  The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb, and this case won't close around the 60gb iPod.  A secondary complaint is that, though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks, there is no protection for the screen.  It's just a hole in the case (like the hole for using the wheel), and I just require more protection for my video iPod.  A third (minor) complaint is that there's a non-removable knob on the back of the case, for attaching the belt clip, and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket.  I'm returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen, too
I live in Washington DC, so I generally get a signal when outdoors.  Using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me
Bought these to use with the XM Myfi. They are not comfortable to use. They put pressure on your ears. Now the good news, they do get decent reception, I tried them in my office in NYC which has a northern exposure and it got good reception
I, too, experienced the "Blue Screen of Death" on my laptop which has XP pro on it.  I had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting.  On another note, the install of the router was GREAT, regardless.  
I didn't get anywhere with the Tech support group and had to return everything.

This picturemate has been a total disaster.  After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow.  Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again. Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image, but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT
This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it. I don't know why I kept trying, as the purchase was made about a year ago. It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses (instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink. Mistake.) I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message, turning the printer off, turning it back on, doing that several times, and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day. 
Now it says the cartridge should be replaced, when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge (and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures, which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge. I have printed about 6.) 
The ironic thing is, the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful. The one that I printed today was perfect. But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours. This is the last time I try to use the printer, it is finally going in the trash
I purchased one (from a local store not Amazon.com), brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer (my mother-in-law's).  The resulting photograp was horrible, it had a very green tint to it.  I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer, the green tint remained.  I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual, checked/cleaned the print heads, and still the problem remained.  Given that the product is still on the market, I suspect I had a broken unit.
I did not like the LCD, it is very hard to read.  I adjusted the contrast but it did not help.  [...]
I have only had the batteries for a short time, but they are working great. I have recharged all three sets "4 per set" three times each. (that's what taks to run my Canon PowerShotS2/I2 camera)all good news.I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours.But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keep me in the field for the day. I do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches.These batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet, that's why I will be getting more. All I can really say is byem
it says it's an A/V dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv. i'm really pissed about this product.what a waste! A/V cables that sell for 20$ are incredible. they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv
I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables.  Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper.  Just ridiculous.  The Airport Express itself is fantastic, but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the mini-RCA cable, and a quick search online for the optical to mini
I dont like this mouse, i brought, and never work, its useles
Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used.  It has nearly ruined my 2001fp.  I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products.  My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out.   My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now. 
This remote controller was quite a dissapointment.  I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better.  This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model).  It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S.  Conclusion:  This would make for a nice ornament (It does look nice, and, if you are lucky you may be able to control  some devices.
I bought this product to replace a previous HP all-in-one printer I had.  This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned.  It does not like photo paper, it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced.  Do yourself a favor - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
merchandise returned to vendor by shipper as damaged in shipment. Cancelled order!!
The only good thing I can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works.  But...software installation is long and tedious (and took three times on one laptop to get to work). Installed drivers cause my PC to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes (about 30%) stop the shut-down sequence (I have to click "end" in a dialogue box).  The ink runs out (even the big black one) amazingly quickly and replacements are $54 at Costco.  It seems you gotta get ONLY HP cartridges, as third-party cartridges fail.  I'll never buy another HP printer
This unit replaced my old AIO 7410, which I LOVED. This one just feels cheap. The construction is cheap, parts are loose, and it feels like a child's toy, not an office tool. Given the choice, I would not buy another one
