The darn thing broke almost immediately.

When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!

What a flimsy piece of crap.

I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again

I bought this for $30 from Best Buy. What a waste of money!

The ear gels are comfortable at first, but after an hour or so, your ear starts to really hurt from it.

The sound quality is TERRIBLE! People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud, even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300.

What is worse, people I am talking to hear me very poorly. They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar, even when I'm just sitting in my car. People can barely hear me over the background noise racket

Beware!  The "Product Features" for this product specified
a "Call answer and end button on the headset." The device I received did not have that feature.  I selected this model because of the advertised feature.  Amazon.com's description was erroneous and misleading.  I returned the item and was charged for the return shipping.  I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product. They ignored my email.

In the online return process, there's no option that states the return was a result of Amazon.com's fault.  Basically, they falsely advertise so that you buy the product, and when you discover it's not the right one you're screwed.  I now understand all those complaints I've read about Amazon.com.  I'll take the loss this time, but I won't repeat my mistake and order from them again.  Buyer beware!

This review is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon.com's false description of the product. I couldn't use the product so sorry I couldn't give a review about it

I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have
I see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why...
I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.  
The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work.
I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase.
The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch.
To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay

I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.'

I owned two of these EarBooms. The fit was comfortable and the sound very good. However, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress

I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. However, I constantly get complaints from whoever I'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth

The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these

Apparently you need to &quot;know&quot; your technical specs -- Universal does not mean Nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with Nokia, I get the expense of sending it back. This should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site

I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work.

I purchased a brand new Samsung t809, and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone.  I went to a genuine T-Mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit.  The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit.  Clearly, a manufactuering defect by Samsung.  I contacted Samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that "the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty."  What?!  End result, I get to duct tape my battery in place.  Thanks.  If you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product.  Clearly not Samsung

I got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, I'm pretty disappointed with the phone. This is my first Samsung and, I'm pretty sure, my last one! I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I "betrayed" it. From now I wouldn't get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe Sony-Ericsson.
So here is a short list of those "little things" that make your life, with this phone (and it's combination with T-Mobile), annoying:
- the keys are not comfortable to use.
- it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time.
- putting a comma, while writing a text message, capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot)
- you can't set the camera shutter to be silent...
- you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones...
- you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address.

And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through, like it would've been in a Nokia (even in a model 5 years old!)

Oh yeah, and T-Mobile really "contributed" to the "greatness" of this phone, removing some of the features and limiting others, like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although, there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp

I can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, Samsung could produce this giant POS. It's flashy, yes. But does it deliver?? No. I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. I loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and I even liked the video feature. But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!! It's been years since I've had such lousy reception from a phone. I'm considering taking the dealer to court over this, since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. I want my money back!!

Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for.  Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business

Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone. They are incredibly cheaply made, and when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call. Essentially unusable, unless we find some trick that we have missed so far. We ordered a Sennheiser PC120 to try instead

I agree with most of the others, it worked okay for a couple of months... now, not only does it not charge my phone, but if I plug it into my phone, it immediately loses all charge!  It's also always falling out of the lighter plug.  I don't have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets

Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr, the phone complains that this an "Unauthorized Charger" and it will not charge the phone. Do not waste your time with this

Does not work with Verizon V3C. When I plug the phone in, it says "Unauthorized Charger" and refuses to charge at all. It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a "charger." I give it one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars. If I could, I would give it ZERO stars. I suppose that would be bad for business, but it is what it is. Avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing. Maybe it works in China, but not in North America

A useless piece of junk.  Worked for 3 minutes then broke.  Have since bought a Motorola-brand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk.  Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag, because you get what you pay for (or what you DONT pay for in this case).

The product description should state that it does not work with the Verizon V3C!  When plugged in, it states "Unauthorized Charger" and will not charge at all (although, if the battery is dead, it will give you enough juice to speak, but it still won't charge(?)).

I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one.  Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking

Save your money.  The eargels split in two days.  I used regular ear buds on the large size.  They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality.  If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping.  I have no use for them

I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.

I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone

As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone.

While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it.

Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.  

The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets.

I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung.

I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his

I was so excited to get my first "cool" phone. . .I've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr, I knew I wanted one.  I saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.

I have only had this phone for a month, but I am horribly disappointed.  It has horrible reception (and I know it's not the network because I tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls.  It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever.  I went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new Samsung, but I'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations.  :

T-mobile has the worst customer services. Sometimes, It is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. Since I started my plan, I had a problem reciving my bill on time. So, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. Also, when I tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two days,and It costed me an additional $4. Every time I tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. More than once, if I stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer. I had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. Also, the reception is not the best in the country. I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network, and they were getting services in places where I don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money

I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have
I see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why...
I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.  
The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work.
I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase.
The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch.
To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay

I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.'

I owned two of these EarBooms. The fit was comfortable and the sound very good. However, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress

I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. However, I constantly get complaints from whoever I'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth

The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these

Apparently you need to &quot;know&quot; your technical specs -- Universal does not mean Nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with Nokia, I get the expense of sending it back. This should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site

I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work. 
Yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one.

I purchased a brand new Samsung t809, and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone.  I went to a genuine T-Mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit.  The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit.  Clearly, a manufactuering defect by Samsung.  I contacted Samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that "the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty."  What?!  End result, I get to duct tape my battery in place.  Thanks.  If you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product.  Clearly not Samsung

I got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, I'm pretty disappointed with the phone. This is my first Samsung and, I'm pretty sure, my last one! I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I "betrayed" it. From now I wouldn't get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe Sony-Ericsson.
So here is a short list of those "little things" that make your life, with this phone (and it's combination with T-Mobile), annoying:
- the keys are not comfortable to use.
- it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time.
- putting a comma, while writing a text message, capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot)
- you can't set the camera shutter to be silent...
- you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones...
- you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address.

And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through, like it would've been in a Nokia (even in a model 5 years old!)

Oh yeah, and T-Mobile really "contributed" to the "greatness" of this phone, removing some of the features and limiting others, like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although, there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp

I can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, Samsung could produce this giant POS. It's flashy, yes. But does it deliver?? No. I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. I loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and I even liked the video feature. But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!! It's been years since I've had such lousy reception from a phone. I'm considering taking the dealer to court over this, since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. I want my money back!!

Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for.  Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business

The darn thing broke almost immediately.

When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!

What a flimsy piece of crap.

I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again

I bought this for $30 from Best Buy. What a waste of money!

The ear gels are comfortable at first, but after an hour or so, your ear starts to really hurt from it.

The sound quality is TERRIBLE! People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud, even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300.

What is worse, people I am talking to hear me very poorly. They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar, even when I'm just sitting in my car. People can barely hear me over the background noise racket

Beware!  The "Product Features" for this product specified
a "Call answer and end button on the headset." The device I received did not have that feature.  I selected this model because of the advertised feature.  Amazon.com's description was erroneous and misleading.  I returned the item and was charged for the return shipping.  I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product. They ignored my email.

In the online return process, there's no option that states the return was a result of Amazon.com's fault.  Basically, they falsely advertise so that you buy the product, and when you discover it's not the right one you're screwed.  I now understand all those complaints I've read about Amazon.com.  I'll take the loss this time, but I won't repeat my mistake and order from them again.  Buyer beware!

This review is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon.com's false description of the product. I couldn't use the product so sorry I couldn't give a review about it

Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone. They are incredibly cheaply made, and when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call. Essentially unusable, unless we find some trick that we have missed so far. We ordered a Sennheiser PC120 to try instead

I agree with most of the others, it worked okay for a couple of months... now, not only does it not charge my phone, but if I plug it into my phone, it immediately loses all charge!  It's also always falling out of the lighter plug.  I don't have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets

Does not work with Verizon V3C. When I plug the phone in, it says "Unauthorized Charger" and refuses to charge at all. It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a "charger." I give it one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars. If I could, I would give it ZERO stars. I suppose that would be bad for business, but it is what it is. Avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing. Maybe it works in China, but not in North America

A useless piece of junk.  Worked for 3 minutes then broke.  Have since bought a Motorola-brand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk.  Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag, because you get what you pay for (or what you DONT pay for in this case).

The product description should state that it does not work with the Verizon V3C!  When plugged in, it states "Unauthorized Charger" and will not charge at all (although, if the battery is dead, it will give you enough juice to speak, but it still won't charge(?)).

I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one.  Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking

Save your money.  The eargels split in two days.  I used regular ear buds on the large size.  They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality.  If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping.  I have no use for them

I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.

I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone

As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone.

While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it.

Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.  

The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets.

I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung.

I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his

I was so excited to get my first "cool" phone. . .I've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr, I knew I wanted one.  I saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.

I have only had this phone for a month, but I am horribly disappointed.  It has horrible reception (and I know it's not the network because I tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls.  It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever.  I went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new Samsung, but I'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations.  :

T-mobile has the worst customer services. Sometimes, It is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. Since I started my plan, I had a problem reciving my bill on time. So, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. Also, when I tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two days,and It costed me an additional $4. Every time I tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. More than once, if I stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer. I had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. Also, the reception is not the best in the country. I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network, and they were getting services in places where I don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money

The product itself would have worked great if they included all the pieces. Only the plug in portion came, no USB cord.  I then requested a cord and WebTreo said they would mail one to me immediately, but none came.  I emailed their customer service again and have received no response.  FYI - it works to charge your iPod too

Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril

Looks nice, protects the i860 very well.  But... I've only had it for 3 months, the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used.  The swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets.  The cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera, it has to be held down away from the lense.  Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers

I've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers, but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for.  A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go, and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire.  I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone.  It arrived, however, defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged.  Per the STI Mobile web site, I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone.  This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service.  In the first one, the rep told me that I was mistaken, and must have been sent the wrong charger.  No offer was made to replace the charger, strangely, which was included as part of the package deal.  After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger (I took the phone in to a local merchant, who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective).  At this point, the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone!  This entire process took several weeks.

In short, I guess you get what you pay for.  If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs, but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider

My Motorola C139 with Net10 crashed on me.  I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone, except they sent me this flip phone (V171).  I liked my candy bar phone and didn't want this flip piece of junk.  I was happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing, and then things quickly went downhill.  Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone, even though I had minutes available on the old phone.  

I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phone, which works awesome with no problems.  She had problems all the time with the V171.  She had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed, even the local numbers.  She also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send.  In my opinion, the V171 is completely worthless.

Overall, I am a very dissatisfied customer.  My recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service.  Go shop Cingular for all the great deals they have

I wouldn't recommend this product to any one. The phone cover really sucks. I just used this product for a month....and the clip cover peeled off....really disappointed with this purchase.

I agree on "it was too good to be true" statement for this package.
The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap !. The 
charger melted in the car after a sunny day, I couldn't even test it. Earphone quality is not good as well, giving a constant humming noise. The case is the best out of these three so far. So one out of three for 10 bucks. I am not recommending anyone to buy this item.

The case and ear bud are fine, but the car charger I was sent doesn't even fit my Nokia 6230. That was the main reason I bought this package.

This deal was too good to be true. Of course I wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least I expected them to all work. I don't know if I got a bad earbud or what, but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used.

The case I didn't need, but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed. The power adapter seems to work fine. So basically I spent $9.99 and am only using the power adapter. I guess that's a good enough deal. I think I'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud/headset though

I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala-500 and used it all about maybe 5 times.  Why such a short amount of time?  Because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in the car with the windows up and radio off.  It's a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on  the other end can hear me.  Now I keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power.  If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere.  The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone.  Think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first.  Even with the rebate I only paid $[...], but still not a bargain.  The one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone

As soon as I bought it I realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. Few days later my concerns proved them selves, every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it, untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me. There goes a $200 phone, lost because of a stupid $10 holster.  Do not buy this product, if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericsson's "ICE-26" that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. As for me I gatta get me a new phone, shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it

The skin is a great idea, but it is not practical.  It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have, so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo.  The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons, so I misfire applications.  The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster.  Do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly

I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement, however I was disappointed.  While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment, after the first day it looks like it's two years old.  If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily.  And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt.  Don't even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket.  Finally, the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover.  If you're in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover, but for the rest of us...keep shopping or buy insurance

The SkinTight cover is cool. Works pretty well with the unit, but the belt clip SUCKS! It's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa.

PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone

I was with Sprint for almost 10 years, all told. I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. Just recently, without any warning, whatsoever, they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time.  Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever.(I had only backed up about 45 of them.) I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years!!! This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! So, my advice: DON'T TRUST SPRINT!!! Again, this happened with any warning! It could happen to you too! Trust me: avoid Sprint at all costs! I should have

I got this as a gift, its too thin for me. I"m not into the credit card sized phones.  Picture quality sucks, its hard to manage it.  the menu buttons are inconviently placed, such as the My content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling.  its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone!

I bought this item to protect my new Motorola L6. 
First of all, it's a cheap piece of plastic... would break if dropped.
Second, and more important, MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK WITH IT ON! The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone, preventing any usage of the entire phone. 
BEWARE... DON'T BUY

I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewer's ear...  I figured at this price, I'd try for my wife and I.  When I first tried them on, I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on.  Even with the provided clip, these fall out and you're better off not using them.  Frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones.  Two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive.

Samsung has a great phone with the Black Jack.  Unfortunately, the headset jack is not a standard jack, but instead one unique to Samsung phones.  Therefore, you are forced to buy Samsung's headset.  Bottom line -- don't bother.  The design is horrible.  The earbuds don't stay in the ear.  What makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord.  Any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear.  I hope that Samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones.

I think this is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had.  It just doesn't seem like it's Nokia quality to me.  I would get the Samsung slider if I could do it all over again.  Battery life is subpar, slider seems cheap and breakable, speakerphone is not loud enough.  The interface is pretty smooth, but that's about it.  If you have to have a simple interface, then this might work, but otherwise I'd get the Samsung

I got this phone cause I thought it would be a nice little phone. Wrong. Yes it plays songs. Yes it is little. Too little!!!! This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers. The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK! It is hard to use. I returned the phone after only 2 DAYS! I got the Samsung T629. TOTALLY better. Does almost everything the Nokia does, but is better, looks better performs much better. If you are a teenager this phone may be good for you. The Samsung even sounds better. Get the Samsung, same price more phone

Snaps on easy but snaps off easy too.  It also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do.  This case also hinders comunications, maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line

I got this for Cyber Monday for $20 too.  I thought I couldn't go wrong for $20.  Well, I was wrong--it was twenty dollars completely wasted.  I'd feel bad giving this POS away...  I could not get the thing to stay put, the boom mike is so bottom-heavy that it won't stay close to my cheek even sitting still!  And it pokes out about 3 feet to the side of my head (it seems like it anyway) if I am moving around at all!  Almost like it was DESIGNED to get as far away from my voice as possible.  But even holding the stupid thing with my hand did not help the sound quality.  I got constant complaints that I could not be heard very well.

There are only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating.  First, I did only pay $20 for it.  Second, it's a decent quality, just piss-poor design.  And three, I liked that when I clicked the button (not due to incoming call), it automatically launched the voice dial menu, so I could really make a call without ever touching my cell phone.  I guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfr for both headset and phone. But it fails miserably at it's primary design goal, so I heartily recommend staying away from this product

Saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece, so I took it.  The installation was a little tricky at first, but once i got it paired with an LG Chocolate, it was functional.  Tested it out all over the house, and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet.  Used it driving, and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels.  Not a quality bluetooth earpiece.  Look to Motorola or Jabra for a decent one

This product alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF. You must still buy other software to use it. When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says "may require 3rd party software for various uses". I just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED. 

I would rate my experience with this seller as: Dissapointing

At least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere.

I know from experience. I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years. I think one company makes them all. They will NOT last. The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out. For some reason, it only happens with the Palm-type cables. My iPod and USB retractable cables have lasted. Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hot-synching and/or charging daily.

I bought this cable. My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable, but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place, so WATCH OUT, and treat this cable nicely. I like the retracting cable concept, but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged

FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back

This holster offer's your phone ZERO protection.  Not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster.  While it does allow the phone to swivel, thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated, I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead.

Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement.

All in all, I would NOT recommend this holster.  I'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak..

While this is a functional holster, be aware that you may -- like me - find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster.  I know, I know.  You can turn off the "answer phone when opened" option, but that is not preferred by everyone.

You may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely.

I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would be a good company. I have never been treated so rudely by customer service people in my life. In multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twice. It was a nightmare.

I ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money. I feel stolen from.

I would never do business with this company again. Huge mistake in the first place

I'm writing a review for the first time because I've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts. I ordered them on December 5th. It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again

Great concept: protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches.  The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint.  It's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off).  The protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well.  Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if I try and reposition the unit itself).  The plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged.  All in all, I am pretty disappointed... mainly because I paid over $33 for it.  It's now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust

This phone case is the worse one ever for the TREO 650. Yea the color is great but, if you just tap it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit ease.  The screen protector is not that great either.  A piece of plastic over the screen.... You have to lift it up so now you have a piece of 2 cent plastic over a five hundred dollar phone.  Not smart.  Now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screen to protect it. Quote "It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed)." Well about this statement. Insurance!!! If you invest in a five hundred dollar phone then you must have insurance on it.  So, I guess you are not hosed in the end.  Final:  I am very disappointed in the cover and recommend that you invest in another product (leather).  I bought this item hoping to have something different.  The sale price is really what it is worth.  Six bucks....  $6.00 on a $500.00 phone.... My bad.. I really should have tough about this one and this is a warning to others.  How cheesy... I tough I was getting a deal

I bought three of these at once - and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3.5mm headset for listening to music, but they didn't handle calls at all - everything is full of static, listening and talking. I just placed a call with it, and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible, but it was the adapter that was the problem, full of static and echo. I would never use these for calls

I enjoyed using this phone for some time.  It was functional, it felt solid, and it had a nice low profile look. 

However, after around a year and a half, the continued act of opening and closing the phone has caused the hinge to crack, and to gradually break off completely.  I now have to hold the phone together with my hand while I talk, which is extremely awkward.  This is especially frustrating given the rest of the phone is so well made.  Furthermore, it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my "upgrade" opportunity (in a couple of months), and right after my purchase of some extra accessories (batteries/chargers).  

Search around online for "a670 hinge" and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine.  This in itself wouldn't be a problem if Samsung would willingly replace the phone.  However, they are not claiming it as a design defect, and neither Samsung nor Verizon are offering to replace it.  Bad form for both, although perhaps Verizon isn't as much to blame.

I would avoid both Samsung and this phone because of this incident.  This phone is seemingly designed to be durable, but it frankly is not meant for the long haul, and is too pricey given its average performance.

Samsung A670 is a lame phone. Also, the battery life is not good. It didn't have many features so its just a waste of your money. The Ringtone Volume was too low. I would suggest Samsung improved this phone. I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again. I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust.

I don't know about other company, but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture.  I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3, but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic.  There is no leather on the case at all. Not only that, the cover smells like petroleum oil

This worked for only a couple days. Although the belt/pocket clip held my Treo securely, it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way. After a cople of days, the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time...after a couple more days it was useless.

Save your money on this one..

I've owned a Tracfone for 3 years.  My old Tracfone quit working, so I purchased a new one.  I've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone.  It's been a nightmare-after 4 weeks, 3 new sim cards, and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps, I've accomplished nothing.  My phone is still not activated, I still don't have my old number transfered, and I've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps.  I don't recommend TracFone

Got it home put in the sim card, add the battery and changed the phone. Once it was charged I went to activate the phone, it said "insert sim". I redid several times, called support, got the run around, becaused it did not understand my error. When I got a person, she said the same thing, after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card, the lady said they would have to send me a new phone, mind was broke. So we will see if the new one is better, next week when it comes

We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year.  Very inconsistent service.  When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was "blacklisted".  After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500.  We were told it was "like for like" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand.  If a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!

I got the phone because it was small but I didn't know I'd be sacrificing so much. The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day. I get shoddy service and while i do like the design, there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing. All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies, but it's not really the best for what you'll want to do with your cell phone.

I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards. The phone will say "Insert SIM Card" even if it is inside. It recyles, and when it does so, the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped. There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics, ringtones, and games.  You cannot change the mini display. Save your money because you might end up spending 40-50 bucks on SIM cards, and another 50 for a replacement phone.

My wife and I got two of these phones for "free" when she switched to Cingular. After two weeks, we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly. My phone was fine, but has lately been experiencing the same issues. I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas. Sometimes I'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back.

I do not recommend this phone. Even though it is/was free, it's not worth the frustration

I got this phone in January, and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls.  They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone... but it wasn't.  The one I have now isn't as bad as the first one, but it still loses service and drops calls constantly.  Don't buy this phone

This has to be the worst phone I've ever owned.  I thought Motorola StarTac (my very first phone) was bad, wait till use this phone.  I have 4 LG C1500 phones in my family plan.  2 works ok but the other two, where do I begin.  First, it keeps complaining to insert sim card although it's inserted properly.  Went to Cingular store got the new sim card, works ok for a day.  Next day, same thing.  Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones.  Now one of the two doesn't complain about the sim card but occationally it says it's not in the network although it shows full bars.  The other one still have problem with sim card.  I just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but can't talk more than a minute.  It just drops a call in the middle of conversation.  I now am trying to get a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it.  I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to go, what a nightmare...

We bought 2 phones on a family plan last October.  We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability, no bells and whistles needed.  Our major use was to communicate between each other.  We were happy for for about 5 months.  Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned.  Our phones were replaced during April. One sim card was replaced during June. Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone.  Another replacement phone is on the way to us.  The major problems have included "service not available" even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location, "unable to read", "insert card", and of course dropped calls.  Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call.  At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution.  I can not depend on it.  I would not recommend it to anyone

The construction is shoddy, very bad quality leather, made in China.

The USB cable and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone, purchased through Xcingular. The phone will NOT connect to the pc. The phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable. Uninstalled the software and tried again, with firewall shut off. Same result. Connecting a USB device should NOT be this difficult.

I bought this case to protect the best bar phone on the market, the Sony Ericsson W810I. Within 2 Days the case already started to crack and chip. I dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case. The case also scratches easily too. The only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish, but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon. 

Bottom Line: This case only protects against scratches.I was actually looking at the Clear Silicone Cases

First: The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws.  Second:  No Fixed belt clip.  Third: Only the case is black, all other parts are clear plastic.  Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each, spent 35 dollars on shipping.  Guess i got what i paid for.  Now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund

When I first got this item I was very pleased. It was so cheap and it looked great. It snaps so easily on and feels really cool. However, after about 3 weeks, the duller, not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off. Beneath it was a very shiny black coat. I was so disappointed, I took it off and went with my original cover. It looks really bad and just looks like something I've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks. I am very displeased with this item

I have a UX245.  As you can tell from the item name, this product should have been compatible with my phone.  However, when installing the cd, you are asked to pick your phone from the list.  My phone wasn't even on the list.  Then I got a message saying it woulrd corrupt my computer if I continued to download.  However--who wants to send it back for a refund when you lose shipping and the shipping was as much as the item!!!!!!!

DO NOT order from this company. The cable does not fit in the phone. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity. The cable came a few days late. When it arrived, the cable did not even fit. The software for the cable was defective. After it had finished installing, Windows XP came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system. Eforcity is awful

USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in (it works now, but has to be held in by hand).  Came with no instructions, and, if you don't have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers, you won't be able to figure this out.  The driver CD is useless more or less, since they don't send you a "product number," which is needed to access the menu on the CD.

It works, and I am able to send files to and from my phone, but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer, and a whole lot of cursing. I won't be ordering anything from them again, and if I had it to do over, I'd order the cable from a different company

I was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own.  The cable itself is O.K. but I had to locate the correct drivers on my own and it's definitely not intuitive, and definitely not plug-and-play.  Support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitor's website to locate the drivers on my own.  Also, (and with no offense intended) if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you

It took a week and half to receive it - 3 days to get confirmation for the order only, and they ship by regular mail;

then there's a single protective screen pre-cut in a plastic, it doesn't cover well the whole screen surface (it's about 1-2 mm narrower) and it's very tough, hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath, I had to take it off immediately, then once removed from place it's a waste

The case fit well, but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart. I'm very gentle with my phone, but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one. It no longer stays on so I threw it away. THe bottom is still on great, but it dosn't do me any good without a top!

I ordered a three-piece set of an earpiece, phone cover, and car charger for my Motorola i860 phone. When I get the order, the phone cover, custom supposedly, was too small for my phone. My earpiece worked temporarily, then it started shocking me, now it doesn't work. The only piece, the one I didn't need, that worked was the car charger. I'm very unsatisfied

Net10 cell phones are great, but don't buy this card.  Net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards.  I put the pin # in my phone and did not receive the minutes.  I called technical support and received 1000 minutes.  I was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that I will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days.  DON'T BUY THIS CARD

I put the multi-clip on my belt and the spring metal bent out of shape. I found another clip from another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also. The case is great but the accessories suck. Poorly made with light weight materals. Save your money

This clip came with the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone. The second day that I had the case I lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasn't able to be fixed. I am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner. I would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around at a desk. I don't know if it was just my clip, or if all of them are made poorly.

FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back

Excellent high-res LCD, but the rest of the phone was a disappointment. Poor overall interface with configuration options in non-intuitive locations. Particularly disappointing was how it handled WiFi. Each application seemed to want to be tied to a particular wireless source. So, I'd go home and try to get it on the wireless, but I'd have to bring up the app, let it spin a while, be told it couldn't connect, then I'd have to tell it to use the local WiFi. It was just clunky. The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone, and a very expensive an bulky one at that.

I can check and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to get an appication running and connected via WiFi. Much better WiFi management is a must before I'd consider this phone.

This is a serious example of one device trying to do everything, and doing nothing very well. The device is relatively nice, but I gave it two stars because a $500 price tag means it has to deliver. I bought and quickly returned the phone

I wouldn't buy this unless it's an emergency, because it's one of those chargers that reports errors, and makes your phone start beeping non-stop when it's done charging.  I don't want this because I like charging at night, the other chargers don't do this (I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall, like switching off, when the battery is fully charged..so it beeps as if it's being plugged in over and over).

When I first got it, I was trying to carefully plug it into my phone--and I didn't want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger.  It wasn't going in smoothly and it didn't match up or seem to fit inside at ALL.  So I went a day without a phone and I did more research to see why the heck they'd lie that it fit my phone.  Finally I got fed up because I couldn't find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it.

FINALLY it fit!  But I had to shove it in.. who knows if it was damaging my phone.  But it was charging so I was happy (my cell is my only phone.. so I was cut off from the world).  Then I tried getting it out and couldn't figure it out!  I had to jimmy it off, and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secure itself.  I was able to put it back on, and finally learned a routine so to speak, for taking it off, but it's cheap.  It's very cheap.

So, the charger works, but it's very hard to use and it isn't convenient at all.  I don't recommend it unless it's an emergency.  For me, it was

I guess you get what you pay for. This charger works, but apparently not quite the way Sony Ericsson would like it to. When using this charger, my SE W300i often reports charging errors. This never happened with the original SE charger (which my dog ate, hence the new one)

I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that weren't working.  It was too frustrating.

Can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well. 

There are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual.
--customisation of the front screen is do-able.
--there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  No mention in the user manual.  Stumbled across it.
--Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular.  First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  A double payment.  The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.  
--The volume was always frustrating.  I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  Volume controls are easy.  However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.  
-- I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  You're being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise.  It's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume

I must live on the edge of Cingular's (and everyone  else's) coverage area.  This phone can't hold a call at my house, and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength.  Part of the problem is the coverage area, but part is the phone, too.  I have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem.  If you live like I do in a pothole on the Information Superhighway, avoid this phone.

I'm on my 3rd v-180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it (under warranty) for another.  Unfortunately, they have the option of sending you a refurbished model, which means that they tried to fix someone else's problem phone and pawn it off on you. This one is going to get flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy, since Cingular says it's now out of warranty and I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months

I gave this one star because there is not an option for zero stars.

Problems:

General:
        1.  Sim card does not store the full information on each          contact and is therefore useless.

Phone specific:
        1. Sim card failed after less than 1 month and had to be replaced.
        2. Foolish designer attached vibrator module to flat cable connecting base piece to hinged piece.  The vibration causes the cable to delaminate and soon the vibrate doesnt work and eventually the screens fail and you have to order replacement phone.  
        3. Less contact fuctionality of any of my previous phones ie. multiple number entries.
        4. One of my 3 phones (in a 8 month span) failed after a fall of 10" onto the floor. Yes 10" ... less than a foot.
        5. I have to disassemble the phone and clean the microphone every month or so or no one can hear me talking.

We were excited to find such a good deal. The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse. The home charger never worked. The car charger works, so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package. One thing my boyfriend and I learned through this experience, is to pay for known quality and performance, in the long run you save money, hassle and time

For a good price of approximate $4.50 (as I recall) plus shipping, I ordered the Bargaincell- Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter.   It did not work.   I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back (at a cost to me) and probably received a replacement. But for the cost of the unit, it was not worth my time. I've resorted to using a standard car recharger

THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! It is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer, I wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer.  NO WAY!
the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it.  I have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work.  I dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is.  The disk has 40+ files on it, I dont know if one of the other drivers would work, but I am very frustrated

Well the only good thing one can say about the Treo 680 battery is that it's thinner. The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day. As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 4-5 hours under business use, the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are: deplorable, distressing, lamentable, unsatisfactory and unsuitable. 
I'm really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy battery with the Treo 680. But happily, there is a quick fix, buy 1-2 more batteries and keep them charged and don't leave home without them ;-

Unlike the other review, I can not recommend this at all.  The GPS regularly takes at least 10 minutes to find satellites (sometime longer), the Palm needs to be resynced (bluetooth) with the GPS at least once a month.  When it does work, its great though

I bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge (after sitting in a closet for a year). I was thrilled to get a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again. I opened it up, put it in my phone, tried to close the battery cover and it would not close. Not even close. If I forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latch, but it was actually bending the plastic of the phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment.

The battery is about 50% thicker than the standard battery for a Motorola v60. Might be great for the extra battery life, but bad if you can't get get the battery cover on your phone. I give it two stars because the battery may work fine for all I know, but it won't fit in a v60

Although it's listed under the accessories section for the V66, it is NOT for the V66.  Well, I guess it will work with just the phone, but not the extra battery.  No sense in having this if it doesn't charge the second battery.  I checked it out on the Motorola site, and in fact, it is the wrong one.  This charger is the Motorola SPN5029, which doesn't work with the V66 and 2nd battery.  The correct number is the SPN4970

Hi,

Before buying this phone from Amazon, I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new. I subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and I am using it on the T-Mobile network.

I now have a problem on the display within 2 months of purchase. I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech support, they asked me to read out my serial number. It starts with a HAGA which, they indicate, means that it has to be on the AT&T Wireless Network. According to them, I am in violation of the warranty since I am using it on the T-Mobile network. How am I know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my purchase? If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone, obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network.

Palm is taking the easy way out - they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon. Amazon, itself, does not provide any warranty.

If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions - please let me know.

Thank

This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working. When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then I called T-mobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset. Still didn't work. I called back on satuday 02/04/2006, Palm told me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or pay $25 to get a "premium exchange option" and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day. I called back on the following Wednesday palm said to wait untill Friday.Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday. I asked to be refunded my $25 because they lied on the terms, the operator said that she could not

I purchased a Treo 600 when it first came out. That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650. I was on Cingular with both phones. Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had. I'll spare you the details since they've been documented well elsewhere. I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me, I decided to cancel my service with Cingular, which renders my locked phone a $400 paperweight. I've gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS. Palm was a good company once, now they have got their heads up their #&(&^$#(. Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now???

I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years. IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited.  The device can be used for phone calls, calendars, web browsing, email, IM (ICQ, AOL, etc .. ),  internet radio stations, document editing, games, modem for the laptop... and that is just the beginning.

So why only two stars?? and why poor execution?  Very poor voice call quality, reported by many and totally unacceptable!!!  Luckily for me and some others; one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution -- open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil.  It worked, but it should never had to be necessary.

Also screens are week.  Drop on the hard service will break it.  Luckily for

I bought this for my LG Mint Chocolate VX8500.  When you go to install the driver, you're supposed to select your phone from the list.  Well, it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete, and my phone wasn't on there, which probably means that yours won't be either.  Don't waste your time on this cable and just buy the music essentials kit that is actually made for this phone

The product arrived fine and on time from AccessoryOne.  But the cable would not stay connected in the USB port on my computer.  I had to hold it just right for the cable to stay connected.  I threw this cable away and wound up buying Verizon's Music Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600.  The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver that work fine

Thanks God that the phone can survive a moderate fall.  The case pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case, its all loose after that.  Another disappointment, the circular 'knob' that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing, again you guessed it, falls.

Advantages:
1) Superior protection: I have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case.
2) All buttons accessible, though a bit difficult to get to in cases.

Disadvantages:
1) Signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case!  
2) Belt clip useless, since the case can easily open, spilling out the phone when on one's belt.  
3) Side "ok" button difficult to press, same with top two front front buttons (above "start" and "ok" buttons).

Summary: 
Usable only for protection during transportation, and does this well.
Phone should be removed from case during usage

When I recieved this item, I had mixed emotions for the product. On one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. Also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard.
However, due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials, the case is very thick and bulky - when using the belt clip, the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip, but leans at an angle.

BUT, the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 (which at such a steep price, is not something I like to drop). The problem lies with the snap-shut system that closes the case. Because the metal is so thin, it does not secure very well, and can come open pretty easily. To fix this, I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone, so that it was much harder to both open and close the case. This, for the most part, solves the problem, but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order.

My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case. This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages. This is the only reason I did not give it a one-star rating. 

I am currently looking for a soft case, preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip, rather than bother with a clip anymore.

As a final warning - BE CAREFUL if you buy this case. Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point

Let me count the ways this thing let me down:

1. You have to open it to slide out the full keyboard, making it vulnerable to damage

2. It doesn't matter whether you open the case or not. If it drops, the case falls right open anyway, spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protect the 8525 from.

3. The case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it.

4. The case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something, and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged (at least that's what happened to me).

Super disappointed in this product, in case you couldn't tell

Please please dont buy this just by seeing the photos.It looks nice and great but practically this is a piece of junk
1.it makes buttons more deep down there by making inaccessible.
2.The stylus grove is not good there by making stylus to project out and it will slip
3.the flip is improper.I mean who on earth would do such a lousy design.It opened and my fone hit the ground thrice and i cingular does'nt insure this instrument.
4.The screw.one of the worst part.It cannot sustain the weight of the total phone with the case.why the hell is screw for?
6.Once i hook up this fone to the belt i don't want that my fone would twist and turn 
7.and the worst of all,when the flip faces downwards,which happens by twist and turns,the flip opens and cell fone hits ground wowowwww such a nice design to a piece of junk and hats off to the lousy designer and I hate my self for buying this

The latch is pitiful.  The phone fits nicely but that latch is NOT secure.  With in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customer's house.  Tons of fun watching your $500 PDA hit the ground and the battery come flying out.

Phone is ok but the case is getting replaced ASAP!!

DO NOT GET THIS CASE!

Originally, I purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525.  However, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up.  Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but I have several big dents and scratches on the case.  I'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up.

The latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use, especially since you'll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen.  Also, it took a bit getting used to, to have to open the case to make a phone call.

The overall quality of this case is very good tho, because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons.

I guess its a great case if you don't wear it on your belt.  But I can't justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket.

The cover doesn't fit snug with the phone, the stitching broke after two weeks, and the release button is triggered from the bottom.  it also falls off from the clip.
Today it fell off in a parking lot, when i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car.
This is a poor quality product and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone

I've had a silicone case on my Treo 650 for a long time.  It was thin and the rubber was very grippy (great anti-slip)- once I left my Treo on top of my car (NOT recommended) and drove 10 miles, and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived!    After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it.   The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original case, so much so that it's difficult to use the 5-way navigator without it doing what I didn't want it to do.  The case is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat, unlike the original.  Boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive- since this isn't, I probably won't bother. But in my opinion, there's better products out there

These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia. With that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped. The software being aftermarket too, has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone. Despite what the descriptions say, this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time

I ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life.  After about 1-2 months of use, the thing shorted out and wouldn't work any more.  I decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured I'd give it another chance...  the thing didn't even work out of the box this time.  

I only wish I could give it Zero stars...  spend the money on a Motorola brand charger instead.

I bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a (this model is listed in the description).  First off, the CD that comes with the data cable does not have my phone model on it, making it useless.  I figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from Sony Ericsson's website.  After downloading the software and following the instructions to a TEE, I was still unable to link up my computer with my phone.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case I made an error.  All told, this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with Amazon

Chargers work great and are a great bargain.  However, the generic "LG" driver software that comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesn't have an authenticity signature.  I don't know about other computers, but mine with Windows XP (SP2) won't accept it

Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that Motorola's hardware was very good, but that their software left a lot to be desired.  Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan.  I had made the decision to switch to T-mobile and this looked like one of the best phone options.  Right off the bat I found out that the people who criticized Moto's software were right on the money.  There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone, not the least of which is the -- frankly -- idiotic way the phone book is designed.  Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone.  

As time went by I started noticing that I was missing a lot of calls.  The phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before.  During the course of the last few months (the phone is less than a year old) I've also found that it has begun crashing.  A lot.  Opening or closing it will result in a "white screen of death."  Putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging, that it is unable to charge and that it's SIM card cannot be found, after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off.  With a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off.  

At this point I am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece of junk.  I am also forced to conclude that it isn't the only model which is.  None of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a Motorola phone.  My wife's Motorola has shown its own host of problems.  People working for T-mobile at several stores I have visited have confided that they never, ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone.  In fact I've had T-mobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them, but rather to shop for an unlocked Nokia online.  So that's what I'm going to do.  

Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every night, restart it five or six times a day, and keep apologizing to my friends, family and employers for always missing their calls

I got the HS805 to call home while trucking. I was sold on the AAA battery power source, because the rechargeable ones won't last on a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlet to recharge.

However, I have to say the audio output when adjusted to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler at highway speeds. The wind and engine noise is much higher than in a car and similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft. For this reason alone, this headset is JUNK. 

The advertisements criminally overstate the talk and standby time as well. With a regular new Duracell AAA battery, I get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby. And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable battery I get only 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone. 

As for the marketing department at Motorolla, I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated function and durability. I hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people. Hint: Get a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecing society. You should be proud!

Don't waste your money. After 18+ months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life. Instead of updating to a newer phone, accompanied by a new 2-year service agreement, I opted to purchase a "new" battery. Waste of money! The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must re-charge nightly. That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery - nightly re-charge.

This battery was no better then the old battery it replaced.  When phone was new, battery life was good. Not sure what is the problem.  Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use. Vendor service was good. Or maybe just a bad battery.

I was extremly disappointed when I received this. It did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can. I had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit. When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip... that didn't fit either. I would no recommend this product to anyone, even if it does cost a dollar... with shipping cost it costs about $6.00

The first problem I encountered with this came right after I took it out of the box.

Both connectors were covered by labels, which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pull them off.  I spent about an hour just trying to get them clean enough to use.

Second problem came when I popped in the "software" disc.  It turned out to be nothing more than a readme file linking me to drivers that didn't even work.  I spent another 20-30 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked.

The cable itself worked fine after I managed to clean the connectors off, find the appropriate drivers, and download Windows Media Player.  Be aware, if you have a Chocolate with V5 firmware, you won't be able to use programs like BitPim with this cable

Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline.  Shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month??  They refuse to refund or replace.  They are a shady company and I'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same

I've had car chargers before, for other cell phones, and never experienced any problems. I was attracted to this one by the low cost, but I guess you get what you pay for. It lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether.

This product is not what its cracked up be, if looking for a screen protector, look elsewhere.  I can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad.  Waste of $10 and customer service won't respond to my email, matter of fact, email to customer service didn't ever deliver

This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen. I attempted 4 times, washing the back thoroughly between each attempt, cleaning the Cingular screen with a new lens cloth. Once specks of dust touch the adhesive they're there for good and the protector is ruined. I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid! Save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in.

I have had to exchange my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times!!!!!!  Luckily I purchased the insurance....  I'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr (this last phone only lasted a few weeks!)... This time I am asking for different phone.  The phone works fine then all of sudden one day, 1/2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the "#" is on the screen and you can't get to anything.... No phone numbers, no voicemail, no text messages, nothing!!!! It is extremely frustrating.  What is the point of a cute phone that doesn't work

i hate this phone.  i moved to miami and cannot get reception anywhere. it  cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk.  i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment, so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates.  but here's the thing:  other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem!  they actually get a couple bars of reception, whereas i always have one or none at all.  i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it... with all the same problems.  i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month.  i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price.  on top of that, people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous.  unless you never talk on it, the battery wears out in a hurry.  and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking.  i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident.  i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils.. chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one, or wasting money on a land line.  whatever you do, don't get suckered in by it's cute pink color, because underneath it's pretty exterior it's junk

I'm not a huge fan of this phone.  I got it because I needed a new phone, it was only 40 bucks and, it's pink.  


1.  The battery life on this phone is TERRIBLE.  T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.  Yesterday, after charging the phone the ENTIRE night, took it off the charger about 8am for work.  I made a 5 minute phone call, a 6 minute phone call, entered a number into my contacts, entered an event into my calendar, received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping "low battery"!!!!!

2. The ringtones are SOOOOOOO crappy.  Remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago?  That's what is here.

3. The date and time don't continuously display on the outside screen.  I don't have a clock in my office (I have a very small office and work for a non-profit) and I don't wear a watch, I'm constantly opening my phone to see the time, it's ridiculous.

4.  The battery life is TERRIBLE.


The good thing about this phone so far:

Great reception.  I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am able to speak to them before the battery goes dead.  


If you want a cute-sy phone and you speak for less than 10 minutes a day, this is a great phone.  Otherwise get something else

After my Nextel phone started acting up, I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr style and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the "In" calling was a bonus. I have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860. You can import only a couple of MP3s before the phones memory is full, unless you buy their $50 transflash card (1 gig is the largest). Then, you cannot assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either, a major disappointment for me - again missing my i860 with its 400+ ringtones that I imported from random WAV, midi and MP3 files. You cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events (you have to set a reminder for all, there is no option for no reminder). All in all, not what I grew accustomed to with my i860.  I'm already thinking the $175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the life of my 2-year contract. And that leads me to another rip-off with Verizon, they charge you an extra $35 to sign only a one-year term! Next time I'll read the fine print, and just upgrade my Nextel

well im 16 [writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account] and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink, but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it. first off, it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen, and that takes forever, the phone in general is slow. also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece. Im stuck with this phone for a while, and am not to happy with it

I am terribly disappointed with my RAZR V3c phone.  I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY positive features.  The viewing screen is so small that I can't even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size.   The battery dies about three hours after being charged even if I haven't used the phone.  It does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has Verizon service.  I am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and I can't find any way change this.  I wish I had my old Sprint phone again.

Holds the phone well for a few months untils the clips on the side loosen and break.  After that happens, the phone falls out pretty easily. (and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working)  I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a magnetic clasp.  (The replcement works great

This is a very basic holster, and often simple is best - but not this time. The good news: the 8700 slips right in and out with ease, the swivel works great, and the clip is reasonably secure. A minor issue, becuase its plastic, when the virbrate "ring" is active, it makes an annoying rattle sound. 

The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs (one on each side). Everyday use must weaken the plastic, becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case, which meant that they 8700 would not stay put. It slipped out and fell to the floor several times. I replaced the case, and a month later, the tabs on the new case broke too. 

Due to cheap build quality, I'd suggest you look at third-party case options instead of this one.

The reason I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call. I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better

I have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months.  It used to be only $6 each so it didnt matter too much (Nextel sells theirs for usually $15-$20).  This is a cheap knockoff.  But if you are looking for a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replace them, feel free to buy this item.  Now that they have raised the price to $10, I'll probably not buy this anymore and get the better one at Nextel

ahhh I see your battery is dying.  Be forewarned.  I'm betting this doesn't fix the problem.  I mean really how old is your phone?  Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired.  The Li-ion batteries usually last around 18 months (hence at 18mon a bunch of i-pod users are gonna get pissy when the i-pod doesn't work anymore and you can't change the battery.)

why hasn't yours lasted that long... oh because your phone sucks.  you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 hr on standby at first and then drop down to 4 hr on standby.

Why?  have you noticed yet how hot that phone is running?  it is cooking its internal electronics, your ear, and the battery.

when you get a new phone - the new one will only have a 90day warranty.  T-mobile will charge you for shipping.  you will spend at least an hour with them on the phone.

aren't these costs adding up for you yet

Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users, this belt clip does not fit the phone.  The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove.  Do not bother with it.  This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola phone, but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530

I purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone.  My old battery would not hold a charge anymore, so I wanted a new one.  The new one proved to be just as bad.  I don't think it's a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead.  Would not recommend ordering this if you're looking to replace an old one

I ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters. I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind, not at all like the ones shown. The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pay to send them back. I never got an e-mail about the substituation or response to my calls or e-mail to the company. I will not buy any thing else from them

the other reviewer couldn't run much power through his splitter, but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers, etc.

I wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger, so I thought great.

I can't get any power through mine at all. The little light goes on, but the radar detector doesn't go and the cell phone charger doesn't go. 

I'll probably take it apart andd see if I can rewire it. It isn't worth shipping back.

I really can't recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer

There's nothing &quot;universal&quot; about this product.  It'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones, but don't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter.  I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second.  Sadly, I'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself, and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop.  The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps, which seemed reasonable, so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most, so not only is this busted, but they lie on the package.  I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse, and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one of the springs inside couldn't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it.  I give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously.  For anything else, beware

I have had three of these during my two year contract, I am trying to baby the last one enough until the end of the two years.  Each has had the problem of powering down and re-booting without warning.  The are billed as "Mil-spec" this or that, but unless you keep it inside a purse, get ready for many trips to the Sprint store.  Motorola used to be THE name in communications, but after this and my friend's problems with the Razr's, I'm headed to Nokia

My office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract.  No person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance.  Battery life is terrible out of the box, the interface is clunky, and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance.  If everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you-- it will give you SOMETHING to complain about.  For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your Nextel/Sprint network contract

I have a business acount with 8 lines.Three of my phones are the i530s. I have had nothing but problems with these phones. I have had one repaired three times. Each time I went to repair it I had to be  on a  waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model. I would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later. Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging. I keep spending the $35 charge for swapping them. And nextel customer service is a joke. They will not admit these phones are pieces of crap. When I call I wait for an eternity througha  million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them.

My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message "network not available". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.

My wife and I both got this phone at the same time.  I chose it because it claims to be rugged, and the price was right.  Well, we have had them for around six months, and they are both not working right.  My wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case, so her i560 now wears pink.  Shortly after, it started resetting itself randomly.  She would pick it up, just to find that she needed to enter the SIM password.  Over time it started doing it more and more.  At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change, but later my phone started doing the same thing.  Now, my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day.  I absolutely cannot believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect.  Anybody can ship one bad product, but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable.  Shame on Motorola

I purchased 2 i560 phones - one for me and one for my husband.  Brand new out of the box, 1 of them had a bad microphone (you could hear the person talking, but they couldn't hear you).  Nextel & Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days - but I raised a stink and finally got it replaced (since it was broke from day 1, I didn't want a "serviced" phone).

Here we are 3 months later, 1 of the phones has a bad microphone - AGAIN, and the other phone's keypad just went bad.  We don't mistreat these phones at all - in fact, we hardly ever use them!  

Motorolla & Nextel's warranty is also worthless - we have to pay to ship our phone's to Motorolla, and we don't get them back for 15 days!

I am stuck with a 2 year contract with Nextel, the service has been horrible, and the i560 phones are lemons & junk!  I would NEVER buy a i560 phone again, or use NEXTEL - their service is terrible!  

And yes, many times the person on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking (aka - drunk)

I bought this phone at the same time I bought the i870. I've dropped my i870 a couple of times and it's fine. My husband dropped the "rugged" phone once and the antenna, which sticks out like a thumb, snapped off. 
Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan, regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards. What army? DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! (unless of course, you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months

Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530, which I loved. I was at the end of a 2 year contract, and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons.  Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well. I would have purchased one of those, except I didn't really care about a camera for my phone, and this one was reasonably priced...and I found out you get what you pay for!  The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750, i870 and even my old i530.  I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - I could hear them, but they couldn't hear me.  

A couple of times, I had the screen go to Airplane Mode, even when I hadn't touched it.  The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside, too.  My previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling, but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it.  Not a great design for this holster. Another problem is with the power supply. When charging the phone, it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly. 

Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working.  Living in California apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee.  Fortunately, we were on day 12, and after 54 minutes, one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents, I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order.  

Terrible, terrible phone.  Stay away from it.  Hoping the new one on it's way works much better!

I got this phone as part of a buy-one-get one free promotion. I changed from Cingular because I couldn't stand my bill being constantly wrong. The i560 seemed like a good choice at first. However, it is not as resilient as advertised. Within the first two months, my phone already malfunctioned. While talking to my wife on the phone, the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen. Next, all I could hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key. I was not even touching the phone. The phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off. Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phone, the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode. This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether. My wife's phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone. Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired. 

Caveat Emptor!

I bought my wife a brand-new v170 for her birthday.  She wanted an extra charger to take to work so I bought this one.  Big mistake!  It simply would not fit in the charger jack.  So basically, it's a worthless piece of plastic.  Last night when my wife was cleaning the counter, she threw it in the trash, brand-new box and all.  At $7.99 it wasn't even worth the trouble to try to return it.  Don't make the same mistake I did

I saw the other review that said it didn't work for V173, but I bought this anyway for my V170.  It also doesn't work for V170.  Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me.  I guess sometimes the products are mislabeled.

First the pros: clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screen, protecting them from wear. Fit is tight so the case takes up little additional space in my pocket.

Now cons: dirt and debris easily finds its way between the plastic and the phone. this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone. The plastic screen also attracts dust. When I tried to remove the phone for cleaning, the side of the case ripped.

All in all, I would not have bought this product again. Please avoid

I wanted to give it only one star but maybe it's a little better than the original...but I can't really tell much difference.  It still goes down by the end of the day and I don't like the bulge. Oh well, it's only $15. It was worth a chance...

I assumed that I would get a DKU-5, which is supposed to work according to the Nokia site.   However, I got a DKU-2, which does indeed connect to my phone (6016i) but is recognized by neither Win XP nor Linux.

I'm bummed...  The part number should have been properly displayed somewhere.  The packaging indicates that it is in fact Nokia part

If you are buying this to connect to a Nokia phone beware.  It is a non-Nokia part and will no easily interface with the Nokia software.  It uses a different chipset than the Nokia data interface cable, which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers.  You may be able to get it working, but I have spent about four hours and have not met with success.  I installed the drivers provided.  I installed Nokia's drivers.  I even installed the PL-2303 serial driver, but I could not make it work.  

Also note that this cable is a serial interface.  If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial port, so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed.

I would recommend against this purchase.  Spend the extra money and buy the real thing.  You'll save yourself some head aches and heart aches.

God bless you

Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer.

I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650, and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680. I have been a faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997, and for the first time, I am disappointed. Of course, I still have the friendly Palm OS, tailor made for smart phones. I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15,000 records stored in the Treo's four main applications. But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations, and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands (contrary to the 650, buttons are too close to each other). Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired, especially compared with the 650 after firmware update. Finally, I use Intellisync for dual sync with both user-friendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook; the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo: Intellisync new version added a record number in the "note" field of all my records ! I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with  MS Office 2007 compatibility... Nokia's low blow to Palm ? It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own. If not, it's decided: I will switch to the Pearl

The good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the Treo 650's interface that were clunky, and it seems to crash less, but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience -- so much so, that I wish I had never "upgraded" to the 680.

I 'upgraded' to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems (don't all Treo 650's suffer from that within a year's usage?) and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems. I loved my Treo 650 anyway so I expected something equivalent to the 650 but what I got was a 'smartphone' with quite a stupid battery life.  I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design (some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card) that is causing power to run right out of the phone, in a sharp decline, even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled. Add to this the fact that Palm's website's online user group is not active right now (so no users can visibly discuss this among themselves),and you don't have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward, when they recently dumped this cheaper "smartphone" on the market recently.  Palm, all I can say is pretty "stupid" and wonder if this was your last hurrah before exiting the "smartphone" market?

I've used the Palm OS going on 10 years now.  When my Treo 270 died, I bought a used 270 on Ebay.  Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon.  

I called Palm "tech support" on issues I had with it (dial up networking didn't work on internal browser with T-Mobile).  Forgive me for saying it, but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be.  I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another (he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time- did he think I was lying to him?).   He knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor, constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time.  After a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650.

I then tried the T-Mobile MDA.  I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try.  For me it was a huge mistake-  Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive.  They expect you to study how to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface.  Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use, but c'mon- when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning- I don't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly.

Finally, I give up on Pocket PC (sold it on Ebay) and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out.  The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 (as compared to the 650) and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm.  Overall, it's a decent phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC.  Palm customer support is still useless and, as others have mentioned, the lack of a standard Mini-USB connector is simply inexcusable.  Still, I'm much happier with Palm-OS over Pocket PC.

As I use it, I see that the battery doesn't seem to last very long (just over 2 hours of talktime at the most).  I hesitantly call Palm support and get some flunkie again-  I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their "support".  I'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged.  I hate the idea of making such a compromise, but for me it's the lesser of two evils.  The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset.  They just don't care.   As clunky as my Windows MDA was, its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me (even though the MDA has a much bigger screen).

IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains-  The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people, when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo.  Most of the better designed smartphones on the market (Samsung, Motorola, HTC Wizard) are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market.  I just wish other manufacturers offered Palm-OS based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of Palm, without having to be limited to Palm's poorly designed hardware.

....maybe it's time I finally give the Blackberry a try.... :

First, let me say that I really wanted to like this device. I had patience and understanding for a while but it got me nowhere.
The main issue with this phone is its operating system: Windows Mobile 5.0.
This OS is a piece of fluff garbage. Simple things that should take a click or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just give up.

Main Gripes
-----------
Connectivity with T-Mobile is horrible: accessing the aim function doesn't work 9 times out of 10. E-mail functions are useless. I tried finding a solution for hours and the best I got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that. Internet explorer can NEVER find the page that I'm looking for and consistently tells me to try again. Even when connected to wi-fi this happens. Let me tell you also that this device does not let you choose between wi-fi and edge. If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE then it will continue to use EDGE unless you restart the phone with wi-fi enabled.

Calls
-----
Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smash the phone on a daily basis. Usually, I would press talk to dial a call and it would immediately say "Call Ended." It's as if the device doesn't even want to try.
Also, when answering a call, well trying to answer a call, it would drop it as soon as I pressed talk. What the HELL is THAT!? What good is a phone if you can't make or receive calls? Keep in mind this happens around half the time. Also keep in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY! My calls should not be dropping except for when I'm in the subway. The side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation. Not only that, but when you disable it, you have no other method of changing the volume on the device. ARGGGHHH!

Keyboard
-------
While the keyboard is basically easy to type on, the phone is buggy. First off, the t9 sucks! It will completely change the word you are typing to a word that's in its dictionary while you're typing! EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Now get this, you can't even permanently keep the t9 off. So you have to keep going into the menu to change it to normal ABC mode. While I appreciate the ability to have faster typing, isn't the whole point of a QWERTY being able to type without using t9? When you actually get to typing, sometimes, the keys will "stick" and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it. This isn't a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue.

Programs
-------
For all you techno oriented people out there (basically everyone buying this phone), the programs this device has available for download are minuscule. Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a JAVA program (which most programs are coded in) the Dash's JAVA program will not allow you to open those programs. I ALWAYS get an error stating "A Java midlet is not responding" It then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app. Neither of which solve anything.

This phone is so useless it's beyond words. I could go on and on about it's issues but I really don't care to.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE!
While T-mobile customer support is very helpful and friendly, their service/coverage is non-existent. Calls are constantly dropped, I get voice mails without the phone even ringing, and internet connectivity is never really available.
Please, do yourself a favor and wait for the iPhone.

In summary, Microsoft's software and T-Mobile's service have ruined a brilliant design (although with a couple of flaws) from HTC.

There are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to.  I will break it down to Hardware, Software and Cell Phone Service Provider.

Hardware Pro's:
A lot has been written about this aspect of the device, so I'll keep this to a minimum - The best form factor I've ever seen.  This device provides you the power of a Blackberry without the bulky hardware so I can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster.
- A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and quad-band connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset, cruise web pages and have access to email when in the US or Europe.

- The phone quality is excellent.

- The keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails.

- The battery life is great when Wi-Fi is not enabled and adequate when it is. (I've rarely struggled with a dying battery.)  Stand-by power management appears to be excellent.

- Charging of the device is very quick.

- The display, while a little small, is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size.

- The camera is pretty good and it's been really great emailing photo's to people as I'm traveling around.

[After all of the cons that you'll read below you'll wonder why I ever bought the device and why I still use it.  Well here it is:
1. T-Mobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device.
2. It has great hardware that I can use in the US and Europe, I'm just hoping that Microsoft will finally get it right. ]

Hardware Con's

- The touch sensitive volume button is the most ill-conceived feature I've ever seen.  Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level.  Even worse, when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control and randomly change the volume.

- The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device.  However, the blame could well be laid at Microsoft's door for writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications.  Either way, performance is very slow for some basic functions (see below) and I'm afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor.

Software Pro's
- Not many that really come to mind.

Software Con's 
(I hope you're sitting comfortably)

- When a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and which call to put on hold or drop/ignore.  On the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is dropped/kept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed.  The other call is dropped and not put on hold.

- When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked, if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped.  This is extremely counter intuitive.  If the user presses anything other than the "answer" key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I have depressed the "answer" key.

- The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used.  Even worse, upon selection, the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open.  Now, I have what some would call a large database of contacts, but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash.  It's simply a poorly architected database.

- The user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary (as are all dialog windows on this device.)

- One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock.  The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness.  The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged. First of all, the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off.  From the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm....if only it were that obvious.  The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example: I set the alarm for 6am; the next day the alarm goes off at 6am.  That day I set the alarm for 7am - the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am.  The next day I set the alarm for 7:30am and you guessed it, the alarm now goes off three times.  The best that I've been able to deduce (of course, this type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device) is that the user has to actively select "off" for the current setting before setting "on" for the new time.  But there is no indication of what alarms are set, so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of what's set and what isn't....the only way to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard re-boot.

- The calculator is a joke.  If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired.  A calculator watch in the '80's had more sophisticated features.  The user interface is so bad it's hard to describe it in words. 

- Microsoft truly does not understand how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that they've inflicted upon us since Windows 95.  Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menu button.  Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections.  Some features are simply hard to find, but should it really take so many menu selections to find common tools or applications?

- The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous - to put the device in "Silent" mode, but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up, for example, does not work.  Calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property.  The only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events....otherwise you get an alarm at midnight.

- So, on my Nokia phone a thousand years ago, when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I needed once landed.  The phone would then automatically connect to the provider available.  It wasn't completely automatic, but the user interaction was simple and intuitive.  Not with the Dash.  First of all T-Mobile doesn't help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming.  The feature is free so why not add a selection anyway?  All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone won't connect to the local network no matter what you do.  Now, assuming that you worked this out, you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local provider's network.  On my Blackberry this was automatic, but of course with Microsoft there are selections to make, searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice.  Assuming that you get connected at all.

- ActiveSync: This is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work.  Worse still, when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization.  It does not provide you with a fix, a hint or a path so that you don't lose data.  It does not even tell you the data that was lost.  So, I'm using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook and they can't get that right?  (OK, it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft, but come on.)  This was another primary purchasing driver for me.  I am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA - all the time.  It's the only way to keep organized.  I thought that with the same provider of all the software I'd be OK.  Also, as this feature has been around for over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry....how hard can it be?

There are probably annoying nits that I have with the software, but those are the major ones.  And they are major.

Considering this is Windows Mobile 5.0 what on earth were they doing for 1.0, 2.0, etc.?

Service Provider Pro

- T-Mobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe.  They have much better coverage over there than in the US (where I'm actually paying).

- Their package is competitive.

Service Provider Con:

- Coverage is not good enough.  I'm in San Francisco and I have dead spots in my house.

- Their back-end connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy.  At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connection and emails can't be accessed.  But you know there's nothing wrong with your connection because you've been on the browser.  Also, there was a whole day that emails were not accessible.  Because of the many issues that I'd had with email set up and maintaining a connection I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed.  When I finally called technical support they told me that their service was down - no apology, no notification, no nothing.  Certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience.  (So, why didn't I call technical support earlier?  read below...)

- Their technical support structure is terrible.  I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their "help" line.  I'm not going to go into details as it would just take too long.  Bottom line, if you have a problem with your phone say "Dash" at the prompt and then ask for Tier Three Data support.  Everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians you'll encounter have inadequate training.  If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial - DO NOT DO IT - This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device.

So, should you buy it?  Wait until Windows Mobile 6.0 comes out at least.     Maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time. Then see what else is available

My phone broke after a month or so.  After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted to blame me (did you put it in fluorescent light, did you put it in the sun, did you drop it, did you put it in your pocket and bend it, did you put it in your pocket and bump into something, did you drop it, did you break it, did you do something bad to it) they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money.

The most amusing part of the conversation went like this:  would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost $15?  When I responded that the ground would be fine she said "OK, that will be $9.95".  I had to laugh at their arrogance.

I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.  
The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes.

This item was an absolute waste of money and I'm all the more irritated for having purchased it.  Upon attempting to merely insert the device, the outer case of the dongle split open.  What I discovered?  That cute little 'antenna' doesn't actually connect to anything!  It's just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side!

When I finally managed to get the damn thing running (the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pair/connect a device) it worked fine - once.  I turned off my laptop, removed the dongle, and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all.

Do yourself a favor.  Shell out the extra 15-20-30 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2.0 bluetooth usb adapter.  Don't make this mistake

This is a terrible product. It is too big for your BlackBerry. They send it with another door for the backside because your current door won't fit over this huge battery!!

It is frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry, and Amazon, would foist this product on us.

The battery is so big that the device will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holster.

DO NOT BUY THIS IDIOTIC PRODUCT

After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased.  Here are the main issues I have found with this phone:  1) The buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. And, believe me, I do not have very large hands.  2) If you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  You will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  VERY INCONVENIENT!!  There is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) On occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  Not optimal, and I probably just got a bad phone, but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola.  NOTE:  I have no personal vendetta against Motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing

I returned this phone after one week. Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you can't assign specifice ring tones to phone number.
Ear piecs sound quality is marginal.
text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small.
The back panel display is too small and hard to read.

i think that logitech make the best accessories.  I have the camera, the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard..... so naturally this headset was a no brainer.  The reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public.

It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub.  Don't you find that strange?  Aside from that, it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone (can't remember the model).  In addition, it really hurts my ears.. not the most comfortable.... so you decide if this product works for you.

This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this one

I've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. There was no notice when it disconnected. Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.

Logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant

I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller. 

Unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. I agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. It's true. It hurts.

Sound quality is very good. People say they can hear me just fine, and I can hear them just fine.

But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. What good is that? Then when the phone rings, I don't hear it. 

Then the clip broke on this one as well. Logitech again replaced it. But how long will this one lsat? 

Do yourself a favor and skip this one

This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.As for the performance it is great. I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely  reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. Amazon needs to fix the edit system on this

I've had two of these.  Both sounded and worked well for a few months.  then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second.  When this happens, you're perfectly operating  earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery.  While it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of "memory titanum" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium I bet)   Skip by this one if you're smart.  I've been had twice

I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone (Unlocked)a month ago. I was hoping to get the color that I saw on the web page...and that's where the problem lies. 

The image shown is completely misleading.The phone that I received, was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site.
The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised. Also,the phone had 2 different color tones. At night/in the lighting at night, the top part of the phone(the part that flips open) and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray.

Needless to say, I spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange.I didn't have to pay the shipping charges. 

The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again, so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded.

I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided, but again they could not help me. Some one said it could be an item with a defect....but for me
the whole experience was  disappointing.

If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand, and the 'color' which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page...very misleading and wrong to all the customers.

Incidentally, this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it 'pink', but Amazon calls it 'mauve',though the phone and the image shown do not match. 
So stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone...all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted.

I have never met anybody that has ear-holes big enough for these! I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ear! That didnt work, so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound & talk sitting in the seat next to me. I would not reccomend these to anybody.

I don't know about you folks, but I have small ears.  Though the sound on these ear buds are good, I can't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they're too big for me, and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears.  Unfortunately, this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords. Good idea, badly designed for size differences.

Amazon rebate is a scam.  I purchased this headset on 1/23/2007, and received it on 1/25/2007.  However, the RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1/25/2007.  When it works the next day, it can not locate the offer number, nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture.  If you click on the URL link supplied by Amazon Rebate form, you will be able to find the offer by Amazon order number, however, they will disconnect you in the next step saying 'session expired'.  There is no way around, what a scam.  It's a shame for Amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers.  It's $5.99, come on

I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone (which I love) but this case is to snug for it.  The slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out. It's a cute case, I would love to use if it was just a little larger.

I am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for Apple computers. Samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac. The company I ordered the cable from is great, easy to work with, but once again it does not work on a mac. Bummer. I have repeated that it does not work on a mac multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac. I blame Samsung

I bought these adaptors to use regular head phones (3mm) with my cell phone mp-3 (LG cu500) player.  Once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound. you only can hear the music through one ear.  Whoever started the whole 2.5mm adaptor in cell phones should be put in jail.  It makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone.  I have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level.  They all have some type of flaw, the volume won't get loud enough, cord to short, poor sound, etc.

I received 2 2.5mm to 3.5mm stereo headphone adapter. One didn't work. The other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality. If you push the headphone jack(male) all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker. You have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers. And even then the quality is not good

I would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort.  The 2.5 mm jack is slightly too small, creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active.  I tried both adapters (i bought the 2-pack) in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose.  In positive news, the connection at the 3.5 mm end is nicely snug

I bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges.  Doh!  This crappy case broke within 3 weeks of use.  I only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did.  No jostling or forcing the case.  The little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time.

Do not buy this POS unless you want to throw your money out

I ordered one of these and it was dead on arrival.  Also, notice that this is not a Samsung OEM part.  If you call to ask for tech support from Samsung they will tell you they can't help you.  The only positive thing I have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless

I go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it. When i got it in the mail i found that the c.d. they burned and sent with it would not work. You had to have the product license number, which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy. i was never able to get it too work. my advvice to you is not to buy this product, but if you want to chance it you may be lucky.

Bought this because Logitech has a great reputation with other products. I used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough. I actually went back to a Jabra wired unit until recently, when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable, has good battery life, and the sound is better. I guess I prefer the in-ear style

I have two of these head sets.  One never keeps its charge, pretty much from the time I bought it.  The other seems to charge alright.  the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime.
The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic.
Also it's big and heavy compared to the motorola I own.  I highly recomend the motorola. (sorry i dont know the model number off hand

The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.

I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech

Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer.

The phone is great .. and I knew it would be.  And I am a devoted Amazon shopper.  My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans ... a concern that has proved well founded.
I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this site indicating the Pearl "shipped hot," with an active SIM, which meant for those that -- like me - were upgrading (vs. new service), their existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route.  To be fair, that did NOT happen; however, I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept.

The instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the SIM, turn on the phone, and it will work.  And, if it doesn't work, it says, don't call Cingular, call Amazon.  I followed the instructions -- phone didn't work, I called Amazon, at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS!!!

Unfortunately, I let the poor guy have it ... I told him what I truly believe, which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone - which is supposed to work out of the box -- isn't working.

So - 5 Stars for the phone itself ... awesome!  2 stars for Amazon ... they do NOT have the kinks worked out yet.  On a positive note -- I immediately called Cingular, and they resolved the problem for me on the spot (SIM was not activated / in the system)

Junk! Sent with a CD that had a USB driver but wouldn't work on two different computers. Contacted the shipper, Bargaincell, but their only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed. The email stated emphatically that they don't provide support for the product.

I bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer.  The description stated that it would work for my selected model phone, however, it does NOT!!  The software needed to download the pictures is not correct. When we called the customer services they were of no help - they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem.  Apparently I am not the only person to have this problem with the product.  Again, the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate.  It does not work

My old Audiovox phone, the 8500 was great. It fell in the toilet, though, and they didn't sell them anymore at the Virgin webstore, so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store. What a big mistake. It is awful with the poor sound quality, short battery life, horrible ringtones, and worst of all, I was unable to ever retrieve my voicemail! Hello? and it has the most horrible graphics. Does anyone want to buy it, along with all the accessories?? It is barely used...

So I looked on Ebay and found a used 8500 and bid on it, won it, and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610. I like the 8500s micro-size, simplicity, ringtones, animated graphics, etc. I must be careful not to lose it, or drop it in the toilet again, though. My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one, but I cannot get another replacement as I bought this one used.

The pay as you go works fine for me as I do not want to have a cell phone clued to my head. I use it to check my land line for messages and for brief calls. Do not buy the 8610, whatever you do

This review is more about Virgin Mobil customer service than the phone. I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1/22/2007 online thru Virgin Mobile. The phone wouldn't charge. I called customer service and explained the problem. They said did I want a charger or another phone. I replied that I could not tell if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a new kit.  I received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldn't charge.
 I called customer service and explained the issue and it must be the charger at fault. The rep said they would not send a new charger, that I would have to purchase one. 
 I said this didn't make any sense, according to the offer I could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charge  I need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to get a charger?  The support rep said yes and that I had to make up my mind - either return the phone or purchase a charger. 
 I asked to speak to a supervisor. The customer support rep kept going off line (to talk to someone?) but refused or couldn't get a supervisor to talk to me.  She then asked for the ESN number of the phone. When I said I didn't know what an 'ESN' number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the 
phone. I'm not clear why she needed this, since I haven't activated the phone and I already referenced the order (vmu) number.  At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep (obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile) and  at least she was trying to track down some info - or so I thought - she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldn't handle my order - that I would have to call back.  I called back, had to work my way thru the answering system and got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike.  Mike  explained that they couldn't send a charger (none in stock) and that I would have to send the entire phone back - which is what I am now doing - 60+ minutes after the initial call. 

I have to say that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive. They customer service staff is  obviously  poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions.  The interfaces with support are youth geared - not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally.  I am sending the phone back for a refund and re-considering the provider for pay-as-you-go service.   01/26/2007.

I have had this phone for about six months.  I replaced a Kyocera that I disliked because it was so big, but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems.  The menus are very poorly designed, they are difficult to navigate and it's hard to do anything.  The ringer speaker is inside the phone, so when it's closed, it's almost impossible to hear.  I almost never hear it ring.  I usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on, but if you turn the phone off, the vibrate gets turned off, so you have to remember to turn that back on!  I hate this phone, and will be replacing it soon.

 I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VM's warranty was up and i had just purchased a $20 phone card + had airtime credits which were not refundable.
  Now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment.My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches what-so-ever so i was pretty upset.After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they weren't going to do anything to help.
 
     I was offered a replacement slider at $20.Obviously I didn't want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610.By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN (when i called to activate the phone)they have the nerve to tell me that I could've purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of $24.99 because the slider died.The f!@%ng idiots!HELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONER???and after i spent $50 + tax.sheesh!

  Anyway back to the phone review..the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here.Its so low that if its in my purse i can't even hear it! WTF??? Also the battery life sucks, no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half.It also doesnt get good service with the VM/Sprint network, my slider had xcellent service w/it despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls.
   
   So I've had it 5 days and I'm considering attempting to bring it back where I purchased it from.However i don't want to buy an expensive phone from VM because I'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them.
  The way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell + they are expensive.I am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise.Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customer but not anymore.

The phone may be fine but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile service never really worked. Perhaps it was the phones fault I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account. Overall their customer service is AWFUL. Days of waiting and receiving no information. I had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right. I spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed. Now I have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service. I plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone. Its garbage.
I went with the T-Mobile Sidekick and already am way happier

This phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap. Its useless, the software on it is very cheap and childish. Not professional at all, the camera is pitiful, and the keys are too small for anyone who doesn't have 10yr old hands. Just because it has a qwerty keyboard; that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash. Purchase a different phone this one is not worth it

 Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline.  Shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month??  They refuse to refund or replace.  They are a shady company and I'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same

I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes. 

The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.

* Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.

* Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B

* Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.

* Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.

* No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.

* Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great. 

* Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and "A" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??

* Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.

In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you.

After owning 3 Blackberry's over the years, I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering. 

If you're thinking about a Blackjack, I encourage you to be aware that, for one, the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys, and, that you may well be on your own when it comes to service. I feel that it's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not, the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right.

I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and it's nice to have one charging while I'm using the other--you don't have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone.  So I also bought one of Boxwave's batteries for the 8525.

Well, the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine, but it refuses to charge the battery that came with my 8525.  This really limits its usability as an off-line charging device.

The cradle itself plugs into the USB port on the phone, which was not designed with cradling in mind, so it's not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle.  Since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone (who's idea was that anyway?) it almost always gets pressed while I'm wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle.  This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station.

Anyway, just my opinion, but it's actually easier to connect the standard USB charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle, so I'd recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard USB charger.

If you really want to do all charging off-line you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one

This case actually scratches and destroys your pearl. The inside is very rough and uneven; pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone. The phone doesn't provide any protection on top. I really regret buying this ... my phone is all scratched. Get a soft case that stays on permanently. Pass this one up

When I first received the items they didn't work and them I returned and had to spend more money and they still don't work.  I even had the computer specialist at work try and they couldn't even get them to work.  I sent them a e-mail to receive my money back, because I didn't want to keep spending money to send items back that don't work back.  Who would have guessed, but they never replied.  Thanks for waisting my time and money.  I will never buy any from you again and will inform others to beware

Do NOT purchase this "Flexi-Skin. What a waste of 20 bucks!!  The skin hinders the camera's functionality.  A very small portion of the "Flexi-Skin" blocks the camera lens, thereby messing up the photos. I had to trim a portion of the skin away in order to take unobstructed pictures.  Next, it makes your otherwise super-pimp phone look like a bulky piece of junk, more akin to a Zach-Morris style Nokia from 1993..................Additionally,  The Flexi-Skin actually TRAPS dust and other particles between the skin and the phone.    This item blows in both functionality and aesthetics, don't waste you money! ! !

I ordered this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phone. I was so happy to see the package to arrive since using my finger or a pen is not an optimal way to work with this device. 

Sadly these replacement parts do not match the factory specifications. These styluses do not fit into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out further than the manufacturer designed. This makes it easy for the stylus to fall out and does not create a smooth and clean design / look for the phone with the replacement installed.

If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase. The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised.

I am disappointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus.

This has all of the features of the headset that came with my phone, and it was much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from T-mobile.

Brand new, and I had to jiggle the cable near the plug to get it to work. In order to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart, which could have broken the wires if I weren't careful, and may tear further through wearing it. 

The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces; this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple. 

There are several places which I'm worried will break soon through normal wear and tear. The ear pieces are hard plastic, and look like they'll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time. The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music. Also be warned that shipping was listed as $5 for a $7 item, when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 2-3 stamps.

The cable is barely 3 feet long from mike to plug, so I don't recommend it for tall people.

It will do until I can find better, but that's the best I can sa

Says the USB Data Cable works on a VX8600. No driver was included, and no drivers are available on-line for this.  None of the drivers that came with the package worked, either.

As for their return policy, after a couple e-mail exchanges they just sent me an address; they did not comment on paying for shipping or giving me any compensation.  I don't want to wrap something up that I already paid shipping for when it was already an inexpensive item.  Time is money

I guess you get what you pay for, so I wasn't totally surprised that the battery didn't work.  What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a new one, they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paid for it.  Don't do business with these guys, and don't buy this battery

I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4" x 1 3/4" x 0.5", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into.

Considering that the seller enters the "product dimensions" as 4 ounces instead of the measurments, one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake.

I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly

The cable is really junk.  All I want is a cable to sync my phone and update software.  It won't do it.  Half of the time the computer fails to recognize the phone is connected.  A motorola brand data-only cable works just fine.  I was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened.  The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers.  Problem is, the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connecting/disconnecting as mentioned above.  Save money and buy the OEM part.
Moto cord $30 with software
This cord $10 + $30 for moto cord when you realize it's junk.  
Be smarter than me and heed the warnings

I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the original Palm Pilot and have loved them (I think I had three different models over the years). I wanted a smart phone so I could check my email so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm product and so I could stay with my current mobile provider, Cingular. Now I am counting the days until my 2 year commitment ends so I can punt this awful, awful product. I may even bite the bullet and pay off my commitment early just so I can get rid of it.

The battery problem is huge. You must remember to stick this in a charger whenever you can. If you forget and leave it in your pocket overnight then it will be dead the next day. I have turned off every thing I can find that sucks power and it still drains amazingly fast. It won't even last a day if you make very many calls.

The reception is terrible. I've had a Cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of So. California (except for my house of course). With this phone I think you have to be right underneath an antenna to get a signal. I was on a conference call yesterday and got dropped twice. I am envious everytime I get in an elevator with someone who can talk on their cell phone because mine will freeze up any time I try that. 

Yes, it freezes up often. The only way I have found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery and let it do a hard reboot.

The versa mail program that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with. You must leave your work computer on to check the corporate mail. That means if I am traveling with my computer, the phone's corporate mail program will not work. It often will not sync anyway. 

I don't think the browser that comes with the phone will work with Java, so I cannot check my Yahoo mail either. I tried going back and forth to the pre-Java version of Yahoo and that is too much of a pain.

I get all kinds of weird messages with the phone. I haven't ever been able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software, something that never happened when I upgraded before.

Yes, there is a manual that is huge. It is hard to use on line so I guess I need to bite the bullet and print out the whole thing and then take a week of vacation to read it and see if I can make any of these neat functions that I read about work.

Hardly a week goes by that I don't actively think how much I hate this phone. I actually signed on to Amazon today just to write this because the phone wasn't working properly today. What a piece of junk!

I've had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular.  I've gone through 4 phones - the same thing over and over.  Never did they (or I) put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD card (although right now it's working, and the card is not in it - go figure!).  So, I guess the options are not download things, but have the phone work, or download things onto my SD card, and not have a phone

I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years. Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price, I thought my fulfilled contract (I am on month to month now) meant I could qualify for a "new account" and keep my number. No such luck. After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly, I had to return it. It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75% lower than a loyal 13 year customer! I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750

I ordered this phone on 3/28/07. It shipped via FEDEX on 3/29/07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3/2/07. The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for. This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving.  FEDEX's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded.  For the $100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store.

I got rid of the bulky i355s at the end of our contract and bought two of these for our account.  We had to return the first phone (line1) within days of getting it as it would randomly shut off (crash), and other times the volume would fluctuate on its own.  Exchanging it was an ordeal with Sprint - they charged me for the replacement phone and still haven't credited my account after two billing cycles.  A few months later and now the second phone (line2) is crashing.  I'll make a call and hang up - and it shuts off.  Other times it will shut off in the middle of the call.  The other night I went to charge it and it said invalid battery - so I took the battery out and put it back in.  Then it said "invalid charger."  I might go back to the i355, it was rugged, reliable (but large) phone.  I guess I'll have to haggle with Motorola about getting this one fixed/replaced

I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.

$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume

I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy

The sound is great, and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others.  The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear -- this is a first (and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them).

My perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine.
I use the headset all day without any discomfort. I higly recommend it over the other types of headset

i helped develop the danger hiptop (aka "t-mobile sidekick) and hated holding its brick-like nature to my head ... i wanted a good headset ...

the only problem is i *hate* earbuds, so i wasn't looking forward to shopping for/buying one.  i went to the local super-electronics store, and abusing their return policy, bought one of every headset they had to try -- 23 headsets to be exact ... i picked up the jabra only to be a complete-ist, figuring there was no way i'd buy its star-trek-bugs-crawling-in-chekov's-ear styling.

but after trying them all, the jabra was *easily* the best feeling and best fitting.  

in a nutshell, here are the things i like about this unit in particular:

* it comes with 6 different fittings (3 sizes for the right and the left), so you get a chance to get a *much* closer fit than some generic ear piece.

* contrary to what others have said here, the ear pieces stay *very* snug in your ear (if they don't, you're not fitting them correctly).

* i wear glasses, so i can't tolerate over-the-ear headsets.  this, of course, is great in that way.

* i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic ear-only jabra because it:

  1. let's people know you're talking on the phone, and less likely to interrupt you while you're talking.

  2. i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise.

* it's small and easy to wrap up into my cell case.


also in the newest version, they've adding a securing "lip" to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece (this definitely was a problem before).

to top it all off, jabra's support is excellent.  i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me *three* replacements, free of charge, along with a ball point pen for my "troubles."

at 10 bucks, these things are a steal ... using one with my hiptop is a joy -- it means i can still contruct sms's, type in emails, add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone.  if you have a data device of any kind, this will make your phone experience twice as good.

a truly great product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right.  what more could you want?

thanks for reading

I think this is a pretty good earpiece...  granted, I've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's Nokia), but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort.  Where my friend's would fall out of my ear, this one (once I got it figured out) never comes loose.    Second, listening to people on my friend's, I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well, and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when I'm not using the earpiece.  Finally, when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece, she sounds distant and muffled; I've had no complaints from the people I'm talking to using the Jabra, and, in fact, my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I don't.

The ear gels are a bit hard to get used to.  They are oddly shaped (as you can see in the picture), and there are six of them total-- three of them for each ear.  Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels, while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces they've used and that they fit perfectly...  I can honesly say I've had both experiences.  When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head: *very* frustrating.  I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could, I tried holding it in place with my hand, but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands-free earpiece.  Nothing seemed to work.  I was thinking of returning it.  I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I-95.  And then one day, somehow, I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear-- with the little poky-out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal (not the fold on the top of your ear; if you do that it'll just pop out again)-- and then *voila* it stays put.  Matter o' fact, it'll stay put so well that it'll be a little bit difficult-- even *painful*-- to get out again.
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes, different patience levels, and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own.  But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out, I was golden.  I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it.
Admittedly, it is a bit difficult to get into your ear-- I'd say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly (before you're good and practiced at it), which may not sound like a lot, but it's long enough to not recognize somebody's voice or hear the first sentence they say, or whatever.  A *very mild* frustration.  But like all things good and pleasant, it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone, slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat.  In fact, I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that it's in until I go to scratch my ear or something!

The other complaint that I saw on here was that it's not compatible with Nokia phones.  In fact, it even says right on the package that it's not compatible with Nokia.  That's funny, I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine.  They make two other models of EarBoom (one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone), both of which claim to be Nokia compatible, and *neither* of those works with my phone!  Confusing?  Yes!  The problem is it doesn't work with *all* Nokia phones.  While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with, but it didn't include mine (it included one that was, numerically speaking, very close to my model: the 3590); which piqued my curiosity.  And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them.  One of them worked, the other didn't.  The strange part of it was that we couldn't see a visible difference in the two units...  and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it (that's this one, and if you look closely at the picture you can see them), while the other one (the one marked as Nokia compatible) had three.  Hmmm...  Curious.
So my advice is to either know your phone well (as in, have the little book handy) or ask for help before purchasing.

All in all 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars on performance and comfort, but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging.

Addendum:
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end...  And living in windy Providence, this is a bit of an annoyance.
Also, for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldn't hear the person on the other end of the line (and, likewise, they couldn't hear me) unless I jiggled the little jack.  This was *very *FRUSTRATING.**  Now, for some reason, I'm not having that problem anymore.  I'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom.  Either way, it's something buyers should be aware of

So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost (yeah Amazon!), but that's not why I'm writing this review.

I'd like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom.  The eargel thingies are designed quite well, of the three different sizes for each ear you're bound to find one that fits very comfortably.  Turns out I couldn't find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side.  My wife had the exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears!  I hate jogging so can't comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed.  I'd have to imagine it'd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place.

Sound quality from the earbud is decent, but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity, especially the higher frequencies.  Normally this is not a problem, but it can sometimes make the person you're talking to sound like Isaac Hayes.  The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse, without having the voices washed over with background noise.  The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving.  There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum, while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths.

I've asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive, my voice comes through loud and clear despite the boom's apparent lack of length, reinforcing my belief that size DOESN'T matter.  In fact, I have found the mic to be very sensitive to even small sounds.  Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click.  Another example, I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed!!  Yes, the mic is that sensitive.  Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears.  Not that it's obtrusive to the other person on the phone, it's just good to be aware they can hear it all.

What more to say about such a simple device. Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product.  In fact, I just ordered another - it makes a great gift

The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says &quot;Universal 2.5mm Jack&quot;  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product

I've been using my T809 since January and mostly love it.  Three main problems:  

1) There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens.  Looks like crap when the display is inactive.  I've read that other people have this problem too.  

2) I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset (they won't stay in my ears!) and because you can't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music.

3) The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume.  If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings (too quiet) and by the time I realize I'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket, I've usually missed the call.  This sucks and I don't think there's a setting to disable this "feature".

It's close to ideal, but no cigar.  Camera's great, reception's great, easy to use.  But I'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires.

BTW, if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone, make sure you see it on the bill.  I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying.   TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance, but fortunately Amazon exchanged it.

The phone is great. You can check all the specs online and in other posts. You'll see that they're awesome.

From my experience...
Pros: 
- lots of features
- Slick phone... I do care about how my gadgets look like.
- camera resolution is pretty good.

Cons:
- hard to find a good case. I'm still looking for a good one. The one I got, my phone will slip out of it once in a while.
- If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it, fugget'boutit.... Althought it's not really the phone's fault, but BMW's (as I've read on other msg boards), it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW...

I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.

Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!?

Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena.

I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike.

Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking

These are very good and not expensive.
You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.

I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!

Anybody want to trade the extras

These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping. 

The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying

I love these eargels.  My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out.  They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds.  Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them.  (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.

I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes.

I recently got this phone and love it.  T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is.  The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown.  I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades

Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome? 

If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. 

One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage

I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service! 

This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.  

Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone

i helped develop the danger hiptop (aka "t-mobile sidekick) and hated holding its brick-like nature to my head ... i wanted a good headset ...

the only problem is i *hate* earbuds, so i wasn't looking forward to shopping for/buying one.  i went to the local super-electronics store, and abusing their return policy, bought one of every headset they had to try -- 23 headsets to be exact ... i picked up the jabra only to be a complete-ist, figuring there was no way i'd buy its star-trek-bugs-crawling-in-chekov's-ear styling.

but after trying them all, the jabra was *easily* the best feeling and best fitting.  

in a nutshell, here are the things i like about this unit in particular:

* it comes with 6 different fittings (3 sizes for the right and the left), so you get a chance to get a *much* closer fit than some generic ear piece.

* contrary to what others have said here, the ear pieces stay *very* snug in your ear (if they don't, you're not fitting them correctly).

* i wear glasses, so i can't tolerate over-the-ear headsets.  this, of course, is great in that way.

* i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic ear-only jabra because it:

  1. let's people know you're talking on the phone, and less likely to interrupt you while you're talking.

  2. i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise.

* it's small and easy to wrap up into my cell case.


also in the newest version, they've adding a securing "lip" to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece (this definitely was a problem before).

to top it all off, jabra's support is excellent.  i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me *three* replacements, free of charge, along with a ball point pen for my "troubles."

at 10 bucks, these things are a steal ... using one with my hiptop is a joy -- it means i can still contruct sms's, type in emails, add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone.  if you have a data device of any kind, this will make your phone experience twice as good.

a truly great product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right.  what more could you want?

thanks for reading

I think this is a pretty good earpiece...  granted, I've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's Nokia), but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort.  Where my friend's would fall out of my ear, this one (once I got it figured out) never comes loose.    Second, listening to people on my friend's, I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well, and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when I'm not using the earpiece.  Finally, when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece, she sounds distant and muffled; I've had no complaints from the people I'm talking to using the Jabra, and, in fact, my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I don't.

The ear gels are a bit hard to get used to.  They are oddly shaped (as you can see in the picture), and there are six of them total-- three of them for each ear.  Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels, while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces they've used and that they fit perfectly...  I can honesly say I've had both experiences.  When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head: *very* frustrating.  I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could, I tried holding it in place with my hand, but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands-free earpiece.  Nothing seemed to work.  I was thinking of returning it.  I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I-95.  And then one day, somehow, I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear-- with the little poky-out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal (not the fold on the top of your ear; if you do that it'll just pop out again)-- and then *voila* it stays put.  Matter o' fact, it'll stay put so well that it'll be a little bit difficult-- even *painful*-- to get out again.
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes, different patience levels, and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own.  But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out, I was golden.  I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it.
Admittedly, it is a bit difficult to get into your ear-- I'd say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly (before you're good and practiced at it), which may not sound like a lot, but it's long enough to not recognize somebody's voice or hear the first sentence they say, or whatever.  A *very mild* frustration.  But like all things good and pleasant, it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone, slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat.  In fact, I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that it's in until I go to scratch my ear or something!

The other complaint that I saw on here was that it's not compatible with Nokia phones.  In fact, it even says right on the package that it's not compatible with Nokia.  That's funny, I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine.  They make two other models of EarBoom (one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone), both of which claim to be Nokia compatible, and *neither* of those works with my phone!  Confusing?  Yes!  The problem is it doesn't work with *all* Nokia phones.  While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with, but it didn't include mine (it included one that was, numerically speaking, very close to my model: the 3590); which piqued my curiosity.  And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them.  One of them worked, the other didn't.  The strange part of it was that we couldn't see a visible difference in the two units...  and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it (that's this one, and if you look closely at the picture you can see them), while the other one (the one marked as Nokia compatible) had three.  Hmmm...  Curious.
So my advice is to either know your phone well (as in, have the little book handy) or ask for help before purchasing.

All in all 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars on performance and comfort, but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging.

Addendum:
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end...  And living in windy Providence, this is a bit of an annoyance.
Also, for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldn't hear the person on the other end of the line (and, likewise, they couldn't hear me) unless I jiggled the little jack.  This was *very *FRUSTRATING.**  Now, for some reason, I'm not having that problem anymore.  I'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom.  Either way, it's something buyers should be aware of

So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost (yeah Amazon!), but that's not why I'm writing this review.

I'd like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom.  The eargel thingies are designed quite well, of the three different sizes for each ear you're bound to find one that fits very comfortably.  Turns out I couldn't find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side.  My wife had the exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears!  I hate jogging so can't comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed.  I'd have to imagine it'd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place.

Sound quality from the earbud is decent, but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity, especially the higher frequencies.  Normally this is not a problem, but it can sometimes make the person you're talking to sound like Isaac Hayes.  The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse, without having the voices washed over with background noise.  The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving.  There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum, while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths.

I've asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive, my voice comes through loud and clear despite the boom's apparent lack of length, reinforcing my belief that size DOESN'T matter.  In fact, I have found the mic to be very sensitive to even small sounds.  Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click.  Another example, I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed!!  Yes, the mic is that sensitive.  Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears.  Not that it's obtrusive to the other person on the phone, it's just good to be aware they can hear it all.

What more to say about such a simple device. Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product.  In fact, I just ordered another - it makes a great gift

The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says &quot;Universal 2.5mm Jack&quot;  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product

I've been using my T809 since January and mostly love it.  Three main problems:  

1) There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens.  Looks like crap when the display is inactive.  I've read that other people have this problem too.  

2) I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset (they won't stay in my ears!) and because you can't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music.

3) The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume.  If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings (too quiet) and by the time I realize I'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket, I've usually missed the call.  This sucks and I don't think there's a setting to disable this "feature".

It's close to ideal, but no cigar.  Camera's great, reception's great, easy to use.  But I'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires.

BTW, if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone, make sure you see it on the bill.  I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying.   TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance, but fortunately Amazon exchanged it.

The phone is great. You can check all the specs online and in other posts. You'll see that they're awesome.

From my experience...
Pros: 
- lots of features
- Slick phone... I do care about how my gadgets look like.
- camera resolution is pretty good.

Cons:
- hard to find a good case. I'm still looking for a good one. The one I got, my phone will slip out of it once in a while.
- If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it, fugget'boutit.... Althought it's not really the phone's fault, but BMW's (as I've read on other msg boards), it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW...

I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.

$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume

I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy

The sound is great, and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others.  The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear -- this is a first (and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them).

I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.

Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!?

Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena.

I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike.

Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking

These are very good and not expensive.
You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.

I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!

These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping. 

The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying

I love these eargels.  My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out.  They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds.  Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them.  (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.

I recently got this phone and love it.  T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is.  The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown.  I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades

Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome? 

If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. 

One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage

I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service! 

This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.  

Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone

Love it.  Sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel.  Some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but it's still red which is nice.  I will probably get another color on it for spring.  The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different.  Also maintains all openings for data cables etc

I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking.

I keep i860 cell phone in the 'Glove all the time.  It does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone.  It fits it, after all, like a glove.

When I am taking a photo, I simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is, take the photo, and slip it back on.  

Before I used to know about this, I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way, like a wayward lock of hair.  Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary.  They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case, take photo(s), and snap it back on.  Smart.

In fact, the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half.  Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it, guys.   It's a snap!  Snaps unsnap; that is what they are for.

The glove is well named.  It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand.  I can easily pivot it around in my hand, flip it around, pick it up, and basically not expect it to skid around.  Without the 'Glove, you have a bare metal or plastic case.  Smooth looking and - well, maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars!

I like the fast release for the belt hook.  So far, it has not failed me.  I think it is at the bottom, not at the back the way some people have said, but I cannot remember for certain. I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet.

I don't use it that way much though.  The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. I easily fit it in my pocket.  With the glove on, I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily

This protects my PPC 6700 wonderfully... I've dropped it many times and this case protected it like I wanted... No scratches, nothing... Having room for the extended battery is great too, because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone

This headseat is pretty neat when you're on the road or just relaxing between work.  It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pause/play and answer/hangup features.  The comfort of the ear budds could be a little better, but the stereo sound is great

This is really cool phone and has many features. Unfortunately, you could not use some of these features in the U.S. One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price. Its price is just 429.99 on the Nokia's web page.
The phone gets 5 stars but the retailer's price gets -2 stars.

Just received it this week.  Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model, the photos are much better (both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses, but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the N90).  Also, the N73 covers all radio bands, making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae).  The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular, so depending on the city I was in, I occasionally had very spotty coverage.  The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90, and best of all, it is much more compact than the N90, fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket.  Last, there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone, protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?).  As usual, the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera, but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds.

If you don't use this phone, it costs $3/month.  Normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute, which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost.  Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when I'm in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing.  I don't use cell phones much, but if I must have one, I might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill.  For kids who think they can mangle the budget, forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo.  Once they use up the card, the only number they can dial is 911, but that's it.  Bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day.  At some point, I might not be able to live without this.

These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.

I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. THE FEATURES ARE SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THIS PHONE IS A NET 10 WIRELESS PHONE. NET 10 WIRELESS IS A SUBSIDIARY OF TRACFONE.  I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE. I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON [...] ITS A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN CALLING

I've been using this phone with the Net10 service since March, and have to say I am very happy with it.  Coverage areas have been great.
I don't use a cell phone very often, so this was the most economical way for me to go. Although the phone doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have....it gets the job done

I like this little flip phone.  The service has been good and the features are easy to use.  The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phone will last.  The flip part is a little weak, but we will have to see.  It was really easy to add minutes, and you can do it right from your Net10 phone

This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  

As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow

When I first got this, it did not look like it was big enough for my phone, but as soon as I opened the package and put my phone in it I could tell it was a perfect fit. I really like the clear window, which I did not have on my previous case, now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time

My only complaint, and consequently the 4-star rating, is that sometimes I don't hear the Blackberry or feel the vibration. Apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the OEM plastic holster

Overall, I like it.  The best part is the flip up screen protector.  I have had 2 Zire models and managed to break both screens.  My dislike is that I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting.  I have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again, to no avail.  As for the SD card issue, I remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject. To keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo, I drilled a hole in the back, right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes

I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Treo 650 so I can "stay in touch", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome!

No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Treo 650 Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product. 

A must have for anyone who owns a Treo 650. I also see they have these for the Blackberries

When I bought my Motorola V220, my Cingular Store charged top dollar for the car charger - and they were sold out. I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon.  The car charger is compatible with the V220, and it comes with case and hands-free ear bud - all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone.  The ear bud does not have the best sound - voices come across as somewhat muffled, though still audible - and the case is adequate.  I wouldn't buy this set specifically for those items, although they both work with/fit the V220.  As I see it, they were bonuses for purchasing the charger.

Five stars for the charger, three for the rest

The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy.  The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TX--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX.  For some reason, the cable won't let me charge using the USB wall-charger I got for my wife's iPod, but it does charge the TX off my computer's USB port (which is a Powerbook G4--notorious for being underpowered)

Great reception, great volume controls, easy to use... I have the blue, my husband, the black... To the reviewer who said, "too thin" - well, don't get the thin phone then... Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra (plug in) - even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones... which other phone would most likely make you buy.  We're in our late 20s/early 30s - and just dig the phone.  Fits perfect in a small purse or wallet.  

One issue DH has -- the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into (bottom of the phone) and when he is on speaker phone, he tends to hold it there, and it sometimes can make your bars go down.  That is it, and all you have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone

I really like this phone..  its cute, its little, its perfect for a young woman.  I had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't an mp3 player (i have an ipod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a pda (i have a palm tx)... its just simple and cute.

its bluetooth compatible... although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth, but i'm not sure if its the headset or the phone..

**the ringer on it is SUPER quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse.  i'm grown accustomed to "listening" for the vibrate feature instead.

i like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list.  

i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable.

sound quality is good, on both ends

i dig it.  im sure you will too

The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from Scratches, it fits like a glove , really nice , the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked  after 5 days of use, it wasn't hit or treated carelessly. I'll order some more because they are really cheap and  it's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone.Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition, the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it.

Got this to protect my Motorola L6 phone.  It fits the phone like a glove.  I also love that it protects the phone screen.  The only complaint is that the case open easily if it's dropped or handled in a rough way.  Clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that.  My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it. The case still does not have a chip or crack on it

I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and they last about six-twelve months.  I bought this one and it is much more solid of construction, shorter cord, and a better angle to the power adapter.  i bought two of these for less than the cost of one from Sprint.  My wife carries her's in her purse, while I just keep mine in my car.  This is the best car charger for the Treo and I have had Treo's for about 6 years

I recommend this phone to ANYBODY.  I absolutely love it.  I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far.  The music player is great, and I swear...the camera looks ALOT better than 1.3 mega pixel.  The handset is wonderful, and so is the headset included with it.  If you buy this phone, it WILL last you a long time.  

But yeah..so far, no problems whatsoever.  I love it. [..

I am in love...with my phone!  I know that sounds absurd, but it's true.  Originally, I had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting this one; seeing how I had already done so with the Motorola V3T.  

Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorola's V3T RAZR handsets (both for having them freeze at startup), I called customer service and told 'em I wanted this handset instead.  With a minor contract extension/handset upgrade, I was glad I made the switch to NOKIA.  I've only had it for 24 hours and I'm totally satisfied with it.  Below is a list of "pro's and con's" for you to consider:

Pros:
- Bright and visible LCD screen.
- MP3-ringtones enabled (make sure to cut your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so).
- Video ringers.
- Pretty fast charge, even while messing around with it.
- Bluetooth and infrared-enabled making for quick file transfers.
- Dialing keypad is raised for easy input.
- Date can be enabled on screen (which the V3T lacks).
- Comes with "headphone jack adapter" which enables use of any standard headphone that you may have.

Cons:
- Vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges (by default).
- Power button is somewhat small and difficult to execute.
- FM radio plays with static (this may varies by area).

As you can see, the pro's outweight the con's with this one, so give it at try.  Also, if you decide that it's not for you, return it to T-Mobile within 14 business days of your purchase and get a full refund.  As for me, I won't returning it because it's definitely a keeper!  :

I purchased this phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed. I haven't used all the functions yet (downloading music), but haven't had any problems with anything else. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros
1-Colorful/Clear Display
2-Good Volume (ringer volume is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine)
3-Easy Menu Navigation

Cons
1-No shortcut to get to main menu (have to keep pressing "back" button)
2-Battery access (it's really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and SIM card-could be a good thing though)
3-On/Off Button (it's very small-basically have to use my fingernail)

I got a chance to play with one of these last week. The external speaker is very loud, the controls are easy to use and best of all, it comes with a 1GB card. My only gripe is the slide feels a little loose; I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake. All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capability/software is a lot better than my KRZR

I purchased this Nokia 5300 Black at the T-Mobile store. It does come with 1 GB memory card and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems. Phone comes with USB cable to connect to your computer. I have a Mac so this was easy to do. You will not be able to download songs bought from iTunes but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4. You can hold up to 500 songs if they are all 3.5 minutes long and compressed to 128 kps. My music is usually remixed and/or longer than 3.5 minutes each.

I wasn't able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook but I was able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car. Apple has not approved the Nokia 5300 yet to sync. I am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new.

Overall, I love the feel of this phone, has wonderful 2 in screen, color is great, camera is cool, and it is very intuitive to use. 

I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia. However, the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned. 

Once you load up your songs, the speaker is impressive. This morning, I had the phone playing music in one part of the house, and I had to go get something at the other end of the house, and I could still hear the music perfectly.

Calling on the phone was better than expected. I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of people/background noise and I was able to carry on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my Samsung that was difficult to do this with.

The phone is quite sturdy. And I am happy to have a phone that not everyone has - a Motorola Razor. This Nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but I feel like I have a very unique phone that is more than a phone. 

Who needs an iPod mini when you can get this and your phone all in one?

I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone. There is very little to chose from at the T-Mobile store as far as accessories and Nokia.com didn't have much either.

*****

The alarm feature to wake up is cool too. You can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm. It also comes with programmable snooze. What a dream!

*****

You can make calls without even having to slide the phone to dial. As long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book, then all you have to do is look up and press the green button! 

*****

When you are playing your music, if an incoming call comes in, it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in. Once you are done with the phone call, you can resume playing your music.

*****

As I said, this phone is a gem in all areas - speaker, sturdy, colorful, I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing, call quality is great even in loud areas, and lots of little creature comforts.

Definitely consider this phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone. Else, this may not be the phone for you

I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part. The first thing you'll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is.  This is a slider phone, and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys. The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number that's not in your contacts and to text message. 

Next, we go to the features.  So we got a 1.3MP camera, camcorder, music player, 1GB microSD card, bluetooth support, and infrared port..and *drumroll please* an FM radio.  Now, the FM radio isn't satellite based, so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the U.S., just those stations local to you.

Now I will go into the good and bad things about each feature:

1.  Camera - Impressive picture quality. Yes it's only 1.3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras, but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does? 5/5

2.  Camcorder - Not all that impressive.  While you are recording, the quality seems perfect.  However, once you play it, it turns a bit distorted.  Plus, it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card. 3/5

3.  Music Player - Impressive.  The speaker is of good quality, and very loud.  However, I still could not find a way to change the order of the songs without making a playlist.  There's play, pause, next song, previous song, fast forward, and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures. The buttons must be pressed fairly hard, so your music won't start playing spontaneously in your pocket. Also, I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds. 4/5

4. FM Radio - I bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement.  Well, the truth is you don't need to buy anything extra.  Just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone, and this will serve as an 'antenna' and will allow you to hear stations. And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio, yes the sound will go to the earbuds. However, there's a 'loudspeaker' option that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker, but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in, as it serves as the 'antenna'.  This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone, you NEED to have the earbuds with you. You may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna (or you may have to move) in order to get clear reception. 3/5

Misc. Info:

Only two games to included, and both trials. (Lumines, Texas Hold'em)

You can't transfer games from another phone. You must pay and download them again.

You can't delete the pre-created profiles (those that come with the phone). You can just create your own.

In order to change the phone to vibrate, you must make a vibrating profile. Then to use it, it takes several steps, which is not hard, but inconvenient.  

The interface shows the month and date, but not the day of the week.

Only two face templates included with the phone.

That's all for now.

Overall: 4/

I've owned and discarded numerous chargers.  This one is great - the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use.  It looks pretty fragile, but so far it's held up to pretty heavy use.  Many of the other chargers I've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection - no such problems with this one

I have a baby pink Razr, and this skin looks so good over it. Also it really adds grip, so it's not as easy to drop, and the silicone stays warm in cold weather, unlike the bare metal of the razr. I would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr, they are awesome

This Razr phone cover is a great product.  Hard shell protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable.  Easy access to side buttons...protection on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover I've seen for this phone....keeps keys and screen open so no dust gets pushed up against them....overall a good product for the money

-Good quality sound.
-Accept/Hang calls.
-Volume control.

I don't think I want more. The connector is a Pop-port connector. It's showed just as big in the product's image. If you have a 2.5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image, then what the h... is wrong with you?

This is a great product.  It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it.  It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size

I had a motorola H300 before... and this is leaps and bounds better. 
The sound quality in both units are great but I'm impressed by the weight of this LG unit. It is like comparing stones to feathers (a bit exagerated but you get the point...). 
This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud, which sits snuggly in my ear. The Motorola unit didn't... which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls. That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my head a bit to keep the unit against my ear. With the new LG, I no longer have to look like I have a stiff neck while I'm driving

This product is a good deal if you know how to use it. Unfortunately, if you are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider. The Verizon V=cast product would be better because it comes with Headphones. If you already have the headphones (which cost anywhere from $20-$100) than this product will be good for you

It fits great but doesn't cover the corners of the phone... kinda the point of a case.  The seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful.  The bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip you're stuck with it sticking out in your pocket.

i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me), and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires.  and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40!  so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat, and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing.  the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it, my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device.  i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why.  it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more.  so the connector part could be a little sturdier, that's all

Use it every day, it's a nice connector that does just what it says it does.  As with all Treo/Palm connectors, you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection.  Wiggling the connector where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to work for me

I was expecting just to save the touch-screen from scratches, but these screens make the touch-screen also "feel" better.

There was no loss of brightness with the screen.

Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough.

Its a pack of 15 screens.  Have been using just the first one for the past three months, and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all I'll need to replace it

This is a good holster for my V220. It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be, so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is, it adds a little wear to that area. Other than that its a good holster for the price. And thats another one of my problems. I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall, which was highly over priced for my standards. Amazon seems like a great place to buy it, but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories, then you can find a site with free shipping for it, and its 7 bucks. Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks, but with shipping. I trust amazons shipping though. So if you want a functional holster, get this one

I have had this phone (and Virgin Mobile pay as you go service) for only a day or two, but I wanted to write this review before I forget. I'll update it if I change my mind.

Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in, it's a good ride. The phone resembles a small remote control. It's sleek and unassuming. Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screen, but it's a pleasant experience. The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation. 

It's attractive. It works. It seems a real no-brainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service. You can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuff--but you'll have to get used to the funny graphics.

The UI is totally intuitive. You interact with the menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if you've been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences. 

One thing: this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine (thirties). While it's a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing (pay as you go--for me 18c/min), there's a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel. I have Lily Tomlin's operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds; and if I should ever receive a text message, among my canned response options (that come standard with the phone) are "Hell no," "Can't talk," and "Leave me alone."

My friend has had one for a few months and loves his. He makes a good bit more money than I and sports some fancy handheld devices, so it's not just that it's so cheap and cool.

I'm a long-running Virgin customer, but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry, and so I've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier (including non-US). Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.

Let's start with the positives:

-Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.

-For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.

-Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors. 

-Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage). 

-UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.

-Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.

-Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...

-Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).

On the downside:

-Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).

-Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.

-No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.

-No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.

Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that

I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewer--if you want a phone-phone (without all the extra hoopla) this isn't a bad deal.  I "*bought" a red Slice a couple of weeks ago (take note that I'm not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear) and for my needs (emergencies, quick calls to family from the grocery store) it's just right.  

Good points:

I got mine for "*free" with Reward Zone points at Best Buy.

Fits into a small purse or pocket easily.

Nice looking (someone mistook it for a "Chocolate" the other day).

Clear reception (long distance calls are just as crystal as local; not sure if this is an "area" thing, but apparently the service in and around Chicago's solid).

Pay-as-you-go option works well for someone who doesn't spend a lot of time on the phone.

My Slice holds a charge just fine (I've noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem, but so far, so good) and doesn't heat up, as someone else mentioned (maybe that reviewer's got a defective phone or battery?).

Not so good points:

It's so slim my husband has bet me I'll lose the phone within a couple of months (could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk).

Someone else mentioned the odd graphics (hot dog dripping blue sauce, some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth.  Seriously, I have no idea what those things might be), but I say it's workable if you have a sense of humor (:

Yes, the buttons are small.  I have small hands, slender fingers, and I still manage to bump the "3" whenever I'm trying to shut off the phone.

Sometimes it's difficult to turn on (the button doesn't always respond when I push it, though could be I'm a wimp), but once it's on it's fine. I'm thinking this will get broken in with more use.

All in all, it's not a bad phone.  Beautiful red.  I find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty (phone confessions!).

I'm satisfied with mine.  And since I haven't forked out hundreds of dollars--or any dollars, really--I won't feel too guilty when/if I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork!

I got my Slicer past black Friday for $19 from Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency. The Virgin plan 18 c/min pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they were originally made to do.
First $20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 months (one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active) despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30c/min to Eastern Europe. I used the phone on my business trip to call home. The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phone so far. The Virgin web site is excellent. The account is easy to recharge. They also have planty of ring tones and graphic options 
for downloading (mostly priced about $2 per download).

The phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuff except a camera.
However the memory is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for $19. I am surprised to hear that other people complained about the battery life. My phone holds charge about 3-4 days on stand by. 

The only bad thing I discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone (for example during the flight) I had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again.

I would sincerely recommend the phone and the Virgin pay as you go plan to mature users

As a basic phone, the Slice rates OK. I have only a few minor complaints. 1) When a headset is attached the phone does not ring through the external speaker. So if you are not wearing the headset when a call comes in. The call will be missed. 2) There is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time. It can vibrate or it can ring. 3) The battery life is not as good as stated. In Standby the phone runs out of power after about six hours. 4) With text messaging there is no Reply option. To reply to a text you have to start a new message and then search for the sender of the original message. 5) The ring tones that come with the phone are horrible. Aside from those few problems I have been quite satisfied with the phone

Two week review
I got this phone to use as a phone and am very happy with it. I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review.

First, the qualifier. I have a nice canon camera and don't want to use my phone to take pictures. I don't want to use my phone to listen to music or surf the internet either, I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there. If you are one of those people that has a different agenda for your phone, then this is probably not the phone for you.

The Good
Size is great. This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width, but shorter. It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky.  It makes a razr feel thick, but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvr. 

The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phone. It also has good reception. Sprints network is not the best in my area, but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar.

When I was in the car, the road noise got too loud to hear, but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine, and keep my hands on the wheel. 

Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lot. I expect to spend between $150 and $200 this first year, including the $50 up front for the phone. The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included. Although I haven't tried them, it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level.

Many of the other Virgin phones look like toys. Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it, it also looks like a real piece of equipment. As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP. (in vibrate mode of course) At the same time, my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool.

The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu. What were they smoking when they decided to use a pig for "my account," a dragon for "messaging," etc. Other than that, the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive. 

Can't really comment on reliability on this phone after just two weeks, but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine.

The Bad
Perhaps because they are affordable in other ways, Virgin screws you on ringtones and background. The four ringtones included are unacceptable, and you are blocked from up or down loading your own. They do have a pretty big collection on their website you can get for $2.50 a pop, but none of them sound like a phone.  The included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too, so you are likely to fork out $2.00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well. 

The buttons are a little too small. Most of the time I do fine, but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small. Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I haven't run into that problem any more. 

Battery life has not lived up to what I read, but that might be because of how I use it. If I charge it every night I am fine. I ordered an extra charger to keep in the office and one for the car as well just in case.

Summary
After two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls. It is not big on extras like a camera, but what it does it does well. Virgin uses Sprint's network, see if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a Virgin phone. [...

I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now. I've used it for 3 years and really like it's basic functionality. The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and that's pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have low-battery life. I'm hoping it'll last for 2 more years before I get a new phone to catch up with the modern world

The Speck rubber case is the best case i've found for my Blackberry 7290.  That being said, it's not ideal and i'd make a few changes.

Pros -- protects case well; no screen scratches; minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag; no need to use the belt clip (most women prefer purses/totebags to belt clips!); and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages (no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag). 

Cons -- clear case collects dirt; screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight; screen cover doesn't fit squarely into the rubber case; and screen cover gets scratches on it, making the screen harder to read.  

I get a lot of compliments on this case, it's different enough to be noticed, and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case.  However, because of the cons, I suspect i'll need to replace this case more than once a year.  But i like it enough that i'll pay the $35 to do so.  Maybe the next version will have some improvements.  In the meantime, i feel like i'm getting my money's worth out of it.

I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can "stay in touch", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome!

No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Blackberry Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product. 

A must have for anyone who owns a Blackberry. I also see they have these for the Treos

This case is superior. It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed). The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip. It's bulky and impractical. Just a simple tension clip would have been fine

I have had this for 2 months now, and it has worked out well. I use it on my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercise, I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone. When a call comes, the AudiblePlayer pauses, and I can answer the phone with the built-in button. Voice quality is fine on my end (in both ears) and I have received no complaints from the other end, unlike the other reviewer (maybe he got a bad unit, or his stereo connector is dirty?). When the call is over, the AudiblePlayer resumes. I never have to stop my exercise, or even slow down! My only complaint is that the volume control doesn't work worth beans. When you rotate it, at various positions, you will hear from one ear or the other. There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears; but, that is not at the maximum volume. This is a bit annoying, but something I can live with. I just leave it at one position (close to the max volume, but a little less), and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume

It is so flexible and high quality sound/volume control 

Just plug in a headset of your choice and you can:

* listen to music on your Treo 650 
* Headsets sound awesome on it
* It will automatically shut off the music when the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headset still ON
* Has an awesome volume control 
* Works with any headset and you can hear it in BOTH ears by the way
* I keep my headphones on while on treo cell phone calls because it has a BUILT in Mic which is perfect.  no one can even tell I am on a headset
* I have a stressful job and listening to music while I am working in my home office with headset and the ability to pick up calls and leave my headset on with microphone is REALLY GREAT

BUY THIS NOW - your quality of life will increase

I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. I have dropped it many times- still works.  In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants, I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what- IT WORKS.  I am still using it as it works perfectly - even the camera.

I used my sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it.  The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable.  I will be keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives

This Samsung is the most reliable phone I've ever had. I've had it for two years, dropped it NUMEROUS times, and it is still going strong with only a few scratches. The battery life has declined during this period of time, but it still lasts about two days before charging. While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now, I am impressed with how many applications I use daily - alarm clock, scheduler, memo pad, etc. Reception is usually good too. 
In all honesty though, the camera is not terribly great. Pictures tend to have a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry. I still enjoy the camera, if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options (black and white, brightness, flash, etc.) to make pictures look decent. The video option is rather lame though, as the footage is choppy and you can't even transfer or send it to anything.
Recently when I was on a shuttle, two girls, both with Razors, saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well. Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones. I am supposed to be getting a new phone too, but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up. If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone, this is a good one

Almost 2 years ago, my fiance and I signed up for a 2-year contract with Verizon. We got a great deal for both phones. And two years later, both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents. This is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily. I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone. 

Pros:
 - Sturdy: It's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin        phones. I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition. Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone, the battery doesn't detach easily. Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson, the battery would also detach and I'd have to restart my phone.
 - Compact: Though it is on the thicker side, this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it. 
 - Good Buttons: For those who text message a lot, the way the buttons feel can really make a difference. The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting.
 - Menu & short cuts: On the side of the phone, you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow. If you hold #, your phone goes into vibrate mode. If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera & video menu pop up. You can also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press "up," I have mine set on the calendar. 
 - Long battery life: I'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone, but for every day use, this phone is great with respect to its battery life. There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged.
 - Camera has flash & other neat options: You can also adjust the brightness level, have a self timer, take multiple shots, 10 different "fun frames," and 5 different colortones like sepia, monochrome (black & white and negative. 
 - Zoom: You can zoom upto X4. 
 - Phonebook: Contacts are easy to access and it's easy to search for entries. I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one name. You can enter that persons home, mobile, fax, office and pager number. You can also enter an alias and email address. You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups.
 - Voice commands:By pressing & holding the * button, a voice command menu appears. It's a nice feature but is not something I often use.
 - Speed dailing: One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing. It's nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person.
 - Menu styles: There are 2 different menu styles you can use. I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through. My fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design.
 - Custom welcome and goodbye screen.

Cons:
 - Video quality is poor and very pixelated. My phone only holds 2 15-second videos.
 - Despite the generous 15 ring tones, it's hard finding a ringtone that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. Out of the 15 ring tones, there are only about 2 decent ring tones.
 - Antenna: I don't use the antenna very often but when I do, it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy.
 - Picture quality is not the best. If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone.
 - Does not have V-Cast.
 - No MP3 player.

Overall: This cell phone is exactly that, a cell phone to make calls. It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone.

this phone is great. It was my first phone ever and when it came time to get a new one i just couldnt find a phone as great as this one. So if your looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anything cause let me tell you mine went through world war 3 and its still working like new and not to mention the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in time if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect:) i was and still am real pleased with this phone and it is an excellent phone for anyone!!!!!!!!:

If you're hard on your electronics (like I am) this phone is for you. It's practically indestructible. I put mine through the washing cycle (as in washing machine, yes) three times, let it dry overnight, and it still works perfectly. I've also run it through the dryer twice, dropped it countless times, thrown it at a wall, and ran over it on a mountain bike. The camera still works, and I think the reception actually got BETTER after going through the washer. All it has is some scratches on the casing and a bent antenna. This is a perfect phone for a on-the-go, klutzy person

This Similar Unit is 1/4th the Cost of the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300, and it is JUST AS GOOD.

Verizon Sells it for $19.99 + Tax

Amazon Vendor Sells it for $.01 + $4.99 Shipping

Bottom line, it is just a Piece of Plastic that gets the Job don

This is a very nice case. It fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it. I found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit.

A great case that I would highly recommend.

Quality of this product was excellent.  I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover.  Would recomment this to anyone.  I have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it.  Only one complaint, the clip is not tight enough on my belt, would recommend a little tighter.  Overall, the best I have ever seen.  The stitches are even and tight, good quality

The case fits like a glove!  Appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching.  The cover and back were easy to attach and did not scratch my phone, which I checked by removing the case. 

My only complaint was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt. The attachment kept my phone from laying flat.  No problem, if you slide off the back cover, and take off the small foam piece on the inside, you will see a tiny screw.  Just unscrew and remove the mount.  There will be a hole in your cover; if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece. Attach the back cover to the phone and then fill in the hole with a piece of felt.  Looks fantastic. 

If you are a clip user, the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it. But maybe that is a good thing so that it won't fall off accidentally.

I cannot comment on how well the case will wear since I have only had a few days.  

My friends that have seen it love the new look.  I chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone.  Awesome!!

This was a great price for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery. The only thing I don't like is the lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around. All in all this was a great deal

This is a great basic cell phone. I bought one and received another as a gift. Unfortunately, I opened both so now I have (2). If anyone needs one for twenty-five plus shipping that has not been registered with Net10 (still has bonus 300 minutes and no number), is new, and has all original accessories (open package); or for ten extra you can get an OEM car charger, leather case, and earphone (all unused), please email movieshop(at)hotmail(dot)com

I've had TracFone service for 2 days now and glad I switched.  The C139 is small compact and fits in my shirt pocket.  It lacks in ring tones and the address book could be better but for a simple phone, it's all I need. I don't need the internet access and all the other features I end paying for and not using.  TracFone was quick to transfer my phone number which happened in 1 day and they said it would take 7 days. I'm impressed with their service so far. I won't go back to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in on a service agreement for 2 years.  I have good service and will be saving $300+ a year now.  If you want a nice small light and simple phone that all you want to do is make and receive phone calls, this is the one

For the $50 bucks you pay here, you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime.  That's not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere, it would be $20 bucks, and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately $20 some odd bucks or so.  Plus tax. So cost works about to be about the same.  Frankly, I see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere. 

Regarding the sim card, I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion.  A sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD -electro static discharge- just like computer RAM is.  ESD is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed.  I'd bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows.  Before you handle the sim card, you should "ground" yourself by touching something metal.  Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD.

The phone itself is OK.  It's BASIC.  Emphasis on the basic.    I just transferred my mobile # from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139, about the only edge the c139 has over the V120c is the color display.  Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper.  IMO, Motorola could have added a port to accomodate a USB interface to this model.  It was short-sighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c -also in the same price range- has such a port.  

Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time.  I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday (10/28/06) and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone.  Also, it is an entirely new network.  In Southern California, the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular.  

Suffice it to say, I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly, however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesn't recognize my number and to input my voicemail number. And around and around it goes.  I anticipate nothing but problems with "technical support" when I contact them.  They are very polite as customer service reps, however they can barely speak or understand English.  I am envisioning hours of BS with the call I have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever. Note to Tracfone:  Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT.  

Also, I wasn't overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging.  The V120c is actually more intuitive. It's much easier to use.  But the c139 does have one advantage in this regard - text messages cost only 0.3 units versus on the V120c, TracFone was deducting 0.5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message.  I'm not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone.  It should be one uniform deduction across the board.  Consumers should contact TracFone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon.

Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone and wants an *inexpensive* phone with a much easier on the eyes color display.  Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for $20 bucks.  But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper, and a little more flexibility, then get yourself a Nokia 2126. For the same money you spend here, the Nokia is a better phone.  It has a USB port, a speakerphone, plus other extras.  And you probably won't have any trouble setting up the voicemail either.

My tracfone has worked out good so far. Customer service is fine and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use. If you decide to get a tracfone, please email me for a quick referral before activating it- we each will get 100 free minutes from the 'refer a friend' program. I'll also send you the simple instructions to follow. I've used Tracfone for quite a while, so i should be able to answer any questions you might have. 
ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should be able to get us the free minutes

I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great. I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good. I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces. This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good. i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine.

Are we all talking about the same phone here? I haven't had any problems with it and using it is a breaze. I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plan so I wouldn't get stuck with roaming charges while I was away, far from my calling area. My old phone (also an LG) wasn't compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old AT&T service. I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for. I also like the fact that it has a speakerphone. It does not have a camera, and I was not looking for one. I already own three very good stand alone cameras, why bother with another?? I was although a little aggravated having to re-enter all of my old phone book information because that's the only way you can do it. The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic.

After two no-brand aftermarket cables which were invisible to the phone and Nokia Phone Suite, this cable and the included software driver worked perfectly. (Note: Nokia Phone Suite must be separately downloaded, but is free of charge.)

We have uploaded photographs from our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone.

Nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cable. I recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone. Some Motorola phones accept a universal mini-USB cable which I believe is cheaper

Be careful - Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz.  It is not.  Read the 'Vital Statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz.  Check the Sony web page (and other people who sell this phone) and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz.

I don't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy.  I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case - I have no idea if this phone is really good or not

I bought this phone as part of the Sprint/Nextel SERO plan.

I used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didn't fit my needs for several reasons outlined below:

- Battery life was sporadic -- I got maybe a day worth of power from it. One time it completely discharged overnight. For the price of the phone (and the two year contract it carries) this is a dealbreaker.

- The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area (I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years - so I have some experience with coverage around town). I was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals.

- The phone would sporadically mute the ringer. An incoming call would light up the display but there would be no ringing. This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring.

- For the same monthly service fee, I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet ability. Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen -- but if I'm going to be locked into a 2 year contract I would like to have some fast internet access on the phone. The i880 still uses the slow Nextel data network.

I was not a Direct Connect/Walkie Talkie user. If I were, then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher (since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network). I could not justify being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed sub-par on a network that did not (and likely never will) support the latest high speed technologies.

Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phone:

Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so the micro-SD card is accessible from the outside -- no need to pull the battery to update the card. 

Here's the big things I don't like.

1. You CANNOT use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the micro-sd card as ringtones. 
2. You also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download. Any message (mms) that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper. 
3. Battery life on my phone is flaky - I'm getting maybe a day and one-half with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages.

You must pay Nextel to download ringtones. There are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their micro-SD memory card - however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with.

Note: Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company. If you're making a decision on Sprint vs. Nextel, there are only a couple reasons that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint. First, if the Nextel coverage is better. Second, if you have a need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature.

The Sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications. The Nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrial/construction market. For almost every consumer, the Sprint side is a better deal. Sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives.

Here's my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks:

The Good:

-beautiful speaker phone
-compact design / solid feel
-2 megapixel camera, ability to capture movies
-flip swings open when you push a button
-Nextel sms/mms messages can now be auto-downloaded - I believe this is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature
-nice loud audio
-both Nextel walkie talkie and DirecTalk support

The Bad:
-can't play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other non-Nextel transfer (Note: Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable - but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle)
-Nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier, soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things. While not entirely unexpected, it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to non-construction users (Nextel's core group). If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most Sprint plans which include them. Nextel doesn't have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers. Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens.
-the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to.
-while not phone related, some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals.
-I am only getting about a day of battery life - which is extremely low.

Very well-thought design. I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first. I thought it was weird. But after I looked at the pictures again.. man.. how brilliant! They should've provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on. And the leather is of a very high quality too. The seller is awesome, very Amazon-like shipping (i.e. fast)

This product is definitely worth the $30. The leather is nice and what you can't see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard. When closing the keyboard, the plastic does catch a little, but I think that will go away the more I use it. The phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior. Access to the buttons have been made easy. Each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather. The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating, "ok" and "ptt." The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen. On the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc. Another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clip, however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case. Highly Recommende

I ordered this headset in silver - Webtreo sent out white, but said that even though it appears white, it really IS silver! We argued about the color, and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white, silver, red, and black. It took almost a month to get resolved, but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered. It is very small, light, and easy to use. There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit. The headset gets 4 stars, Webtreo only gets 1 star.I wouldn't order any products from them again

This is by far the best bluetooth headset in the market, it is small and very light as well, just like wearing an earing.  The sound is amazingly clear, people on the other end thought I was actually using my phone.  

I have no problem with it falling off, just make sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ear.  I'm so happy with this cutie that I'm buying it for my sisters & friends

Consumer Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as the best. I can hear my callers while driving and they can hear me. The Samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headset, so you won't look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car. 

And if you want to be one of "those" people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places, it's small enough where people will really wonder if you're a crazy person talking to yourself. Gimme a break! The Samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger. This is super handy since the headset is so small and would be easy to lose or damage if not for the sturdy (but not at all bulky) carrying case.

The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headset that I did not quickly return due to poor headset volume. I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my car. I simply could not hear the people to whom I was talking. The Samsung is the first to provide enough volume. I'm still happy with it after two months of ownership.

The Samsung was also approximately $35 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy or other retailers, whether online or in person. So buy it from Amazon's retailers.

The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stay in your ear while running. I learned this one morning when I was late for work and ran from my car to my office. The Samsung quickly began to fall out of my ear.

If the Samsung's short talk time is not a concern for you, then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremely small package

Excellent sound quality.  Noise cancellation really works.  The button on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call.  Very nice.  Works much better and more reliably than ANY BlueTooth set I've tried - and I've tried almost all of them.

This case has good quality construction and fits properly. It solves the problem of being able to plug in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case. Two things kept me from rating it 5 stars. I prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses. I also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working. The fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning. This is still the best optional case if you want to use the MP3 player feature and require the use of earphones

  I recently took a chance on this item, and I am happy to report that its not bad!
     I was actually not looking forward to a swivel (bad experience) but the swivel is very solid.

    It looks good. The skin is not the best, but I like it.

    The only problem I have with it is that you have to take out the phone completely in order to use it.

It's not rocket science... it works or it doesn't. The device works fine. My only "complaint" is that the cord is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the price. The short cord is the only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating. It's well worth the money

The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster.  How stupid is that?   Why would Samsung supply this type of holster to their customers? 

However, this holster has solved that problem.  You can now flip open your phone when using this holster.  Thank yo

I wasn't expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case, but I'm very impressed.  I bought from accessory one, the total cost was about $4.  The case fits nearly perfectly, every hole is the right size and in the right place, not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case.  Others have complained of chipping paint but in the week I've been using this it hasn't chipped yet.  Can't do any better for the $$$

For the quality and fit of this cover the price is a bargain.  It fits very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grip.  I found the razr v3 to be akward or slippery at times and this cover takes care of that problem.  I would recommend this product highly

If you're looking for a slim cover that won't add a lot of bulk to your RAZR, this one is great. No, it probably WON'T provide much protection if you drop your phone. It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints, and the rubberized material is easy to grip and feels great in your hand. The cutouts for the outside display, camera (I have a V3m), and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well. I don't use the belt clip, as the cover by itself adds hardly any bulk so I just keep my phone in my pocket. Without the belt clip, there is a small 'snap' that sticks out a bit from the back of the cover but it's really no big deal. For the $3, you can't beat this. :-

Thought I'd post this info here, since this subject still confuses people. I just talked to a cust care representative, who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180-day period will invalidate $250 Amazon phone rebate. 
Well, I guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer, since I don't really need a data plan, and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time. Any comments?

I still would like to give it 5 stars since I believe it is a great product. I'll take one star off however, due for its weak battery life, and lack of standard audio connection (2.5" or 3.5" minijack).

There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate.  Lots of good features in the 8525.  

My intent is to document some of the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future.  I am a business user who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device. I use a Motorola H700 headset with my old devices and the 8525.

My overall assessment is; Replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I don't think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use.  All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flip phone. 

If readers find that there is a way to perform any of the deficiencies I describe please let me know.  My suggestions in rough order of priority:

1)  Blue tooth headsets. Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting.  To hear my voice commands repeated, I have to turn on the annoying sound of the PDA, so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset, I can hear my voice commands repeated back.  I am referring to the standard voice dial that comes with the 8525.  One quick solution would be to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA.  Even nicer would be an upgrade that allows full audio with the "VoiceCommand" software (this is documented in many other reviews).  Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate.  It changed back to the original audio setting after turning off the BT headset.

1a)  If I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS display the voice dial page.  Instead the initial "Owner Info" page stays up and you can't see the name on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screen.  Not desirable when driving.  If you didn't set the PDA to its annoying noise level you can't hear the name you requested either.

2) Need to be able to control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio, Vibrate or OFF.  For example need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF or vibrate.  

3) Need to be able to program how long the display stays on.  I am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off when I need to see something.  

4) I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if one was available for long drives when my BT headset battery is dead.  Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeway.

5) Provide a built in way to make the PTT and Comm Manager, and IE Quick key buttons programmable.  I would use them for many other functions; such as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker (need to be able to select speaker here see below).

6) Give me a way to press an external button to toggle between speaker on and off.  I can't easily push the speaker icon with my fingers.  Suggestion. Add a radio button on the volume control that allows you to select speaker phone. Yes you can select the phone speaker soft button, but often the display has gone blank and the keypad is showing.  Turning speaker on/off should be easier. 

7) Provide option to save email attachments to storage card.  That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory. 

8) Remember the Filter setting I selected for Tasks.  If I have filtered by a task category during that session remember the filter I selected.   Currently I have so many tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up 

9) Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key (or make this button programmable) I am always having to close the browser because it gets hit/selected

10) Let me Edit/Paste with one step for notes, word, task notes etc.  The IPAQ has "Edit" at the bottom.  With 8525 OS you must select Menu, then Edit, then Copy.  Keep Edit on the bottom. 

Question: is there a key on the keypad to select CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC (the letters are underlined in the menu, but I don't see a CNTRL key on the keypad?

11) Allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the top and then use the nav button to move across the icons (might be the way to allow an external way to set audio volume)

12) If I power off the device have it remember my input selection.  For example I select "Letter Recognizer".  But I must reset each time I power 8525 off.

I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do. However eventually i found out that the phone part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone. My friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking. The phone ear-volume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places.

Pros:

Software : The windows applications - Word, Excel, Media player. 
           Plus : Ability to create office documents and play games 

Hardware : Micro sd slot - Sandisk card cost me 20 bucks.

Wireless Internet : You could connect this device to any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet. I dont have a data plan with Cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my WIFI home network. If iam at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free.

Cons :

* A bit bulky to carry around.
* Camera is not as expected. The view finder is sloppy and cannot capture images in low light.
* Battery needs to be charged every second day (depends on usage) but even with light use i had to charge it every other day.


Best suitable for :
* Internet savvy people who are on the move.
* Email and messaging.
* As a pocket PC.
* To listen to music (need to purchase micro-sd card)

Accessories:

Boxwave leather case ($30)

Leather case by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device. The only problem is that after you put this case on, the phone volume needs to be set to the max, even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well. But the boxwaver case could be opened half way and folded over.

Bluetooth

This device works very well with blue tooth.

Bottom line:

If you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you.

This is a wonderful device. Build quality is typical of HTC, meaning very good. The call quality is good provided you're in a decent service area (system not overloaded with AMR-HR kicking in). The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable. The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback. There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult (this is perhaps the ultimate "geek" phone). The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools. There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile, but IMHO it's not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be. In general, things work as they are supposed to with this phone.

One drawback is that while the device does support the Bluetooth A2DP profile (stereo bluetooth sound), the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible. The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono, which means you'll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth. The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality, which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve. And even after all of that, there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio. In other words, don't waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously. However, the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular (mono/one ear) BT headsets (I recommend the Jawbone), and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable.

Another audio related drawback of this device: There is not even a 2.5mm stereo jack. The only physical audio out is through HTC's proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack. The saving grace here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable, and also the availability of HTC-to-3.5mm jack adapters on the market.

Even with a few shortcomings, I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market. It packs an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor. If you're in need of a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices, this is your phone

Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed.  I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several  years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professional-by-day \ GadgetFreak-by-night guy.

If you don't read anything else in my review please understand this:
1)  This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump.
2)  If you are NOT in the market for spending around $110 a month for a service plan (voice and data), you have no business with this phone.

This is a productiviy enhancer, it is not %100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day, this phone does the trick.

The battery life isn't that bad as I have this thing in its cradle (not included) during the day.

Screen is bright.
The WiFi feature works beautifully.
The 3G network is amazingly fast.
Works flawlessly with my Exchange 2003 server.  (Active Sync is so easy to setup, a noob could do it.)

The only reason reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it can't make me a cocktail

This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia (it's quite popular in Singapore), and the HTC TyTN in Europe, but in an unlocked model. and quite a bit more expensive than what Cingular sells it for here.  If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product, you will think it's a heavy, over feature laden product that you will never fully use, and its a problematic one at that.  Having said that, this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today.  The features of this phone (3.5G, Bluetooth 2.0, etc. ) are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with you.  You can even install Skype Mobile on this phone.  The keyboard stows away well, and has good feel.

There were initial problems with this phone in the Asian market, that have now been since resolved, and is now robust and reliable.

But one caveat to keep in mind when using this product...it runs Windows Mobile.  Meaning, if you are not familiar with Windows devices, it may frustrate you...it doesn't respond like a non Windows cell phone.  But, if you can overlook that, it will perform better than anything available...even Blackberry devices do not compare to this

Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brand-new 3G/Wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone.  The 3G and Wi-fi works very well in our area.  It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service.  E-mail and internet works very well in both locations.  Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues, since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette, and use a card reader and USB cable for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips.  The color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone.  Again, 1GB allow you to take a very long video in Windows Media Player format.  Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails, contacts, and calendar any time, any place, and automatically chime schedule notices. The only drawback are the battery life, which require frequent charges, slow keypad for phone calls (and I do not know how to silence the keypad), and a little tough keyboard touch.  Lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult (especially shift+A !).  In addition, Microsoft Word processing is slow, and so as Excel, which will require a faster chip. Overall, a great all-around pocket PC in this generation

I bought my 8525 when they first came out, like two months ago right after christmas
I upgraded to a 2gig memory card and also have the GPS service
I love my phone though it might have problems time to time and some getting used to
Overall this was the best purchase for the price, I ended up spending  almost $900
but I also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and some other features

This is the best phone out. period.
no the iPhone isn't going to beat it
the iPhone doesn't have a slide out keyboard
that's soemthing I don't want to part with
I would like to see the iPhones operating system though!
but the 8525 takes home the trophy!!!

Hi, I just recently purchased this phone. and so far these are the problems. Yes you do have to restart the device, it does get hung, but i don't blame the phone, after all it has windows mobile 5 in it. The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week, So be careful. This phone is pretty close to being perfect. Other than the fact that it has windows, The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have. If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities, Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature.. which in return will give u a nice thick bill.. Once you buy the phone i suggest that  you get this software Spb Pocket plus. It helps shutting down softwares running in the background, and adds more features. The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features. It can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once. Overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware. the one star missing is cause it has Windows. Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too.

I bought this cable knowing by reading the reviews that it might not work, so for the price I gave it a shot. This USB cable was a replacement for my other cable that was used as a chew toy by my dog. Since I already had DataPilot (susteen) software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computer with the phone attached it saw it as a (susteen USB cable) and installed all the drivers on winXP, if you don't have susteen drivers/software you can obtain the drivers for the USB cable for your phone from their website (free download). I never used the installation CD that came with this USB cable and I installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes it also works with the DataPilot software, but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830

I've had my Tracfone for about 5 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems. Tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. My email is debsclay@gmail.com

Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things.  This is one better as it has a pen built in.  Just unscrew the tip of the stylus and you've got a pen.  You never know when you'll need one, so when you do there it is.  It also blends in well with the design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactile-ly.  Good stuff

The product came promptly and I am happy with the quality.  However fitment wasn't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo.  Not a huge problem, but something I would feel everytime I reach for the stylus. But the pen works pretty good, and it feels sturdy in my hands.  I would definately recomment this product to others

I recently bought a Nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones.  However the Nokia CA-53 cable was around 50 dollars.  This was a great alternative.  So far everything that I have used it for is working flawlessly.  I would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the CA-53

Works fine. Difficult to connect but connects securely. Comes with an unlabeled cd (couldn't tell one side from the other) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers, though the tones aren't labeled in any helpful way. I was impressed. It also has links to any 1st party software you need though I'm sure a Google search would be just as easy

I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect.  The belt clip is very strong, making accidental unclipping rare. The pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts.  The front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets.  The bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the Chocolate's "End" button.  This allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case.  The only dislike I have is the name "Cellnet" embossed on the front flap, but this is not really a big deal.  I would recommend this case to anyone who owns a Chocolate

I've had this case for under a month, but it's working great.  When I first got the case, I thought I was going to have to send it back because I thought it was too small for my phone(I have an LG CU500 from Cingular.).  It was a pretty tight fit, but it worked.  The case has since seemed to stretch a little  so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out

This is the best phone I have ever had.  Reception is crystal clear, and it is also a mp3 player, with the ablility to add a memory card. Video, and voice recording capabilities, and a 8x zoom camera. And best of all very, very user friendly.

I've had this phone for a week. I'm using it with T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary. In my opinion, it's a feature-packed phone at a reasonable price (for an unlocked smart phone, at least). 

The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well, although I did experience some lags and software freezes (with third-party apps). Fixing it was a matter of rebooting. I think the menu organization could be smarter, but you can customize much of it. 

I do love that the default screen displays your day's calendar agenda. But that screen hides the main menu. Not a huge drawback, but it confused me at first.

Photos with the 3-megapixel camera are grainy (it also has a VGA camera). Since this is a phone first, and not a camera, there is also no stabilization control. It does, however, come with a flash.  

Sound quality of phone calls is okay. Your friends, family and colleagues will hear you clearly. On your end, however, it will sound like you're talking on a cell phone. It's not bad, but I've had conversations on better sounding phones.  

I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet (WLAN) access. It's possible to set a default access point. The problem is that if you aren't at that location regularly, you will have to search for a new network. One way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider. I agree, however that some kind of one-button auto-detect would be ideal. 

I don't like the SIM card slot. The metal cover pops off fairly easily -- as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first. 

The phone's slider form factor moves smoothly, perhaps too much so. By default, sliding the phone completely open -- something that's hard, but not impossible to do accidentally -- unlocks the keypad.  

The N-80 is also bit awkward. It feels thick for lack of a better word. Its 5-way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than you'd probably expect. 

Another drawback: no QWERTY keyboard. You can connect to a wireless one via Bluetooth. But that assumes you want to carry a keyboard. The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible. When enabled, it works contextually: on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs.

Overall, I give this phone high marks for features, but a few annoyances mean it's far from The Perfect Phone

I got this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back. Just right off the box, the phone is quite impressive. Many complain about the response time - yes, this phone is slow but doesn't bother me - far better than my windows machine  Overall, very good phone for what it offers. 

Pros:

*	This phone tops in ergonomics, ease of use, presentation, features, Bluetooth, speakerphone and call quality. 
*	Wi-fi is worth mentioning separately. It is simply superb.
*	Nokia's connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market. It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots of money. I accidentally downloaded a big chunk of data and going to pay through my nose next month!
*	All the apps that come with this phone are quite good. 
*	BT sync with my apple is just fine with iSync. Also I transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable from my Wintel. The phone automatically toggles to "Mass storage" mode when it is connected to PC, which is pretty neat. 
*	I haven't faced any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily. I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 2-3 days, good enough for my call volumes. 
*	Symbian browser is fast and stunning. Bookmarks feature is neat. Having the wi-fi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while you're at home and then use it wisely while you are away. 
*	Camera quality is good. Dual camera is just a great idea. Camera settings are similar to professional cameras - very very impressive!
*	Tried the video mode and came fine. 
*	Battery life, as many claim, seems short - but I charge my gadgets daily - so not a big issue
*	The headset that comes with the phone is really good. 
*	Tonnes of themes, apps etc available for this phone..... 

Cons

*	My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed. It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I "selected" an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left. It is SO frustrating.
*	My second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on, the screen light does not come up. So you won't know - even in the day - which button to press to answer the question "Unlock phone?" - you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain. 
*	The process of taking a picture sucks. The picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get. There is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final image. I sincerely hope if there would be some s/w patch for this. I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras - with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i. That is one far superior camera quality I saw so far.
*	Slider lock and unlock feature is good and bad. I am putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket, the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing. So you would need a small app to do the locking properly.

Overall - good phone. At this point, Nokia has better phones like N95 etc - of course very expensive.

I think this is going to be a very good phone, but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800.00 + dollars.
well I called NokiaUSA direct and regular retail from them is 499.00
all day as many as you want, so it should be considerably less on Amazon.
you would think ?
I guess not !

I've had this phone for a year and a half with no problems.  It is good for making calls which is really all I ask for from a phone.  It is easy enough to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and they've had no problems.  My carrier is Cingular and I've had excellent service in the NY tri-state area and because it is a quad-band phone, I've also been able to use it while roaming internationally.  Battery life is just okay (not as good as my old Nokia)...I have to recharge every other day with normal use.  Overall, it's lasted me long enough that I would call it a good value.

If you're the type of person that doesn't spend HOURS on the phone, and want a good basic phone, this phone is for you. I bought this phone in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks, and it works great. I would say that the only gripe about this phone in the US is the price, I wouldn't pay over 40 bucks for it. It's a nice BASIC phone. The screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones.

I must admit, I was skeptical about this package. It didn't seem possible that the stuff would actually work for such a low price. Even though shipping was steep, it was still worth the money. The case fits great, and it hasn't cracked at all.  Both chargers work great! I think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it, but I can't complain! I would highly recommend this package. The chargers aren't high quality, but they work

This charger is awesome.  It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended, it doesn't get in the way like the spiral cords do.  The cord is thin, not bulky.  I never measured the cord when extended, but it is much longer than most

This car charger is amazing for the price. You go to your service provider store and buy a car charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better. The retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular, or sprint stores.

Car charger serves it purpose, it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter.  The design is basic with no hidden features.  You just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way.  
I would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device.  Otherwise a perfect gift!

This battery performs as expected.
It is the standard Palm battery - meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device. Note also that when using Bluetooth and/or the Blackberry Rim email service battery life is notably reduced.

The solution would be lower device consumption, or a bigger capacity battery - neither of which appear possible at the moment.
So my solution was to have a second spare battery

I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell, and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch.  It was a great investment.  The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use.  Cosemetically, it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing!  The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards!  This is an excellent product

These are well worth the money for your Nextel Phone!  Although it may not list it, from Experience, these batteries fit 95% of all the Nextel phones.  Take a look at your phone battery to see if it's the same shape.  The color will be different as these have a white cover.  

They are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store.  Plus these were NEVER used before!  Unlike the celluar store battery, these batteries come in a box, with the battery in shrink wrap, so you know the battery has not been used.  When you buy then in the cellular store, they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed (and you'd never know it) plus there is no shrink wrap!  Ever buy a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months?  Hmmm, I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one?  Would you know????

These batteries are well worth it!  Buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days

This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery.  However, it seems expensive for what you get, not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable.  Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time, save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price...and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges

Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phone models: A630, A850, A950, A970, A930, A990, A645, and A870. The thin adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office

I originally bought another Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one. I returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better! It actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer. It's a great product for a great price! Delivery was quick too.

Pros:

Fits the phone very snuggly.  Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer.  All buttons of the phone are accessible through the case.  The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and easily remove and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of your waist.

Cons:

You cannot access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case.  The clear plastic screen that covers the phone's screen is a little to far from the surface of the phone's screen.  This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen.  The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but I'm not sure.  

On the positive side, you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online.

Picture quality sucks for the price. Colors are way freaky. The screen is perfect for text but not for pictures. Viewing pictures on this is terrible. Keyboard is ackward at first. The manual needs to be much more detailed. Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots. I expected to use it like a typical pilot, where you write on the screen. This feature is not implemented.  Overall, this is a very good phone. Good reception, great sound quality!! Speakerphone is great! Neat features. Worth the $$

The Treo600 has all the functions I needed -- phone, calendar, camera, etc.  Two shortcomings: 
1) the screen is not good for viewing pictures, but that's what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo650
2) the phone failed to dial two times in two months.  I had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem

This is a good, thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen. I don't foresee it peeling...ever. It has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare, but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on. I've washed mine, it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky. Just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place. It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bend it, IT WILL NEVER GO BACK. So be extra careful

Durable, thick, doesn't interfere in any way with the touch screen. I haven't had to wash it yet so I haven't tried out that feature. But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these it's been totally worth it to me (hey, after spending hundreds on your Treo what's a few dollars?)

These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.

I had it up and running in minutes with my LG VX-8600 (Verizon).  I downloaded BitPM free software to use with the cable.  I just followed the installation instructions that came on the CD that comes with the cable.
I clicked on "discover phone" in BitPM to have it automatically find the phone.  (I didn't even need to go and look for the com port as the installation says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phone)

Note..
When installing, make sure you pick the right driver.. if you have XP, choose the XP driver, not the NT, or Win98 or other driver.  It's part of the file name..look for XP in the driver file name.

Received exactly as stated. My only complaint is in the description- they don't state the length of the cable. My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly. I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire, as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall. I projected the cable to be about 6 feet, and if you do yourself, you're in for a surprise. This cable is only about 3 feet long, otherwise everything is fine. One last thing...The description doesn't state this but, the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models, which really helped me.

On a better note, shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated

Works well. Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install. No synchronization software is included so you have to use a third-party tool like bitpim. Which is ok

I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525, and have had a few problems w/it.  First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt.  Second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest, so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge, I guess I've been really rough on my phone), but I just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge).  But the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it.  When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip, instead I recieved a full refund, so that was a pleasant suprise.  I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone

The K790a is currently the best "Cybershot" camera phone in Sony Ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the U.S. today.  It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones.

In summary, this is a great camera.  Oh, the phone functions are fine, too.  Reception is pretty good on the T-Mobile + Cingular networks (used by Speak Out Wireless).  Voice is clear and loud.  Really good.  5 stars

Great device.  Pictures are amazing for a phone!  MP3 player could use a little help.  Screen is beautiful, and as always menu interface is a treat.  The phone is Java 2 compliant however many programs that run in the background will not notify be able to notify you unless the program is open.  i.e... Mig33.  Very other than the MP3 player, and Java notification issues the phone is a 5

purchased the phone about 3 months, like the nice QVGA screen, and impressed with excellent cam (it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors)
the phone has good reception, at least on par with W810
voice call is OK, but as other users stated, the level is kinda low (esp speakerphone), firmware upgrade (R1KC001) will help
the operation is standard SE style, if you are familiar, you'll be OK without reading manual
the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio (still used by BBC), and it works well with T-Mobile internet; it can play local mp3 (VBR supported), wma, asf audio (rename the extension to .wma), realaudio; but I wish it supports ogg vorbis, which is the audio format I use
bluetooth works pretty well, it works with ALL bt equipment I have (including wireless headphones)
logitech headphones users please read: in order to make the headphones works properly, you need to go to bt menu, and connect from there
web browser can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html, and wap sites
the phone is kinda bulky, and a bulge on cam cover, but it's pretty comfortable and firm to hold, making messaging is a good pleasure
though the phone has lot of functions/features are pretty appealing, it lacks something it's supposed to have:
quad-band, this is not acceptable for this price, even many lower models have quad-band (K550, W610, W580, W810, Z710, W710)
music player should have more file format support: ogg vorbis, streamimg wma/asf, shoutcast
m2 memory card, though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB, PSP card is a lot cheaper
pro:
QVGA screen, and it shows clock when the phone is idle
wireless headphones support
3mpx cam with auto-focus and xenon flash
comfortable and firm to hold
con:
low earpiece and speakerphone level (though firmware upgrade will fix)
tri-band
cam cover bulge
conclusion: if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam, go for it, however, if you travel a lot, settle with quad-band models (they're cheaper

I've had 3 cell phones prior to this one, all Motorola and I really thought they were all pretty good phones...

However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water! It's very compact and durable you can tell it was made with an incredible level of quality control. I don't think I'll ever go back to Motorola.

The camera is a great feature. This is why I bought the phone, now I am never without a camera. The flash is good and strong, so it takes great pictures with good focus.

I don't really use the mp3 feature because I have an iPod. I will not comment on this feature. However I was VERY disappointed that it wouldn't allow me to use mp3s as ringtones. I heard this was because my service provider is a jackass and not the phone's fault though. With a little bit of forum browsing I was able to hack my way around this (if you have this problem email me at skibum2801@yahoo.com)... now I have my very own custom ringtones that come out as clear as day with the nice speaker.

Call clarity is MUCH better than my other phones. I feel as if I'm simply using my home phone it's so great.

The screen resolution is absolutely beautiful. The buttons took a little bit to get used to (because I was a Motorola girl for so long) but I picked it up quickly and now I have no issues.

This is a great phone. Pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carrier. Bit pricey but worth it. Great camera and interface. Super easy to upload pictures straight to Flickr via phone.

This is a top selling handset in Europe - but tricky to get hold of in the US which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology

Coming from a SonyEricsson T637, I was familiar with the SE UI so getting used to this phone was relatively easy for me. I love the camera, it takes amazing pictures and the music player serves my needs just fine. Support for a memory card is a huge plus (I have a 1 GB Sandisk M2 Micro card) and now I never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos. This phone also allows for extensive customization in terms of shortcuts and themes, ringtones, and so forth, which is another plus. As far as negatives for the phone, I only have a few minor ones: the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet, and the camera lens cover sometimes slides open in my pocket, but neither of these would convince me not to get this amazing phone, it's quite possibly the single best phone I've ever owned! Definitely very happy with this purchase

Pros:
 - best pictures yet (3.2 mega pixels) on a cell phone that I have used 
 - built in flash (rare for cell cameras)
 - cover over lens on camera
 - good music player
 - expandable memory with Sony M2 flash memory
 - fm radio 
 - bluetooth works great
 - screen has great size and wonderful resolution
 - EDGE device makes internet data fairly quick and usable as PC modem (via bluetooth)

Cons:
 - keys are small and difficult to press
 - camera lens cover needs a lock switch (mine opens just walking around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket) - very annoying
 - sleep timer is a bit quick and should be adjustable
 - I shouldn't expect it thinner since it is the size of a very small digital camera but I'd still like it slimmer.

this phone has all the feature that i wanted. The camera takes really good picture.  Better than all the phone i've seen so far.  The xenon flash really helps taking night pictures.  I use to own the w800i and this one takes way better pictures.  It has auto-focus and other several fucntion that i haven't used yet.  The mp3 player is also very useful.  I love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phone.  It also very easy to navigate through the phone functions.  My computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded.  it's just like plugging in a flash drive.  The screen is very bright and clear.  The screen resolution is decent.  It's very easy to customize also.  I dl program online to customize the theme.  The battery lasted a lot longer than i expected. Usually last around 3-4 days.
The only complains i have about this phone is the headphones.  Walkman series have way better headphones so when you get this make sure to buy new headphones and adapter.  Another complain is the expensive memory stick micros.  I couldn't use the memory from my w800i phone. and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used

I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned.  It has also replaced my camera, and I am now never without a camera.

I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited.  They don't give the phone a second glance, not realizing it's got the 3.2 megapixel capability.  I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows.

After throwing in a 1GB memory stick (I think it was $79?) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300+ pics right now.

The movie function rocks too, however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject.  The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though, so at least concert videos make for good listening.

The phone works flawlessly with my PC.  If I throw it on the USB cable, it pops up instantly as another drive, just like the camera.  Just drag on/off the music and pics.  All pics are very nicely numbered and named.

If I don't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone, I don't even take it out of my pocket.  The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around.

Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem, which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program.

In terms of being a phone, yeah it's great.  The contact list is easy to work with, the call clarity is no issue at all, good signal, no dropped calls, etc. etc. (this is all with Cingular).  Speaker phone works well.

It needs charging about every 3rd day, charges very quickly.  Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges.  

The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge, it only wants to charge it to 89%.  If I want 100% I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes.

  I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car.  The clip just wouldn't grip my belt securely enough.  I gave up after the 3rd time my Treo 650 hit the concrete.  Most of the time I just slip the thing in my left pocket, but that doesn't work so well with some pants - especially jeans.  
  I decided to try the Treo leather case and I like it quite a bit.  The clip is strong and I find it easy to get the phone in and out of the case.

This is the third case I tried for my Treo 650, and it's simplicity is it's key to success.  My first case had a flapping piece of leather that cost $35 and was totally useless.  My second "skin" had a belt clip that whenever I bent over (to tie my shoes, for example) the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor!  Simply bad design. 

This well designed Premium Side Case is easy to use, easy to wear and gives excellent protection.  When the phone is in vibrate mode, you are always aware when you get a call, page or email.  It's small enough that it's not a problem when worn with a suit, and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt.  Good design is always fashionable and the case is well made.  I wish it came in brown, I'd buy a second!

So if you're looking for the right case... this is it.  You will not be disappointed.

I used to carry my Treo 600 with the original case that came with the device. But soon, I found out that the original case is kind of loose and my Treo fell out from it once. Luckily, it was on a carpet so no damage (at least no visual damage). After that incident, I started looking for a better case, and this one is what I found.

What can I say, you don't know how bulky Treo is until you wear one on your belt. The case does its job - it provide a nice and secure protection for Treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway so you don't have to carry it around with your hand or in you pocket (which barely fit). But Treo is quite heavy and it's thick, so you will definitely aware your Treo is hanging on your belt. And sometime, I just feel like it's too much a burden and I want to get it off me. But overall, I still prefer to have this than the original case. And, the heaviness is not this case's fault, should blame Handspring (now PalmOne) for not making it lighter... :-

This case is great for protecting my Treo, but the downside is that I have to remove it from the case to use it.

I purchased it because I had actually dropped my Treo when walking with it balanced on my portfolio, now I clip it to the  portfolio and it is secure and safe, and I don't run the risk of leaving it behind

This case does what it is supposed to do... it protects your palm treo phone.  It is very nice looking and durable.  The only negative comment that I will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit.  That is why I gave it a 4/5.  Amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price

This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  

As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.

The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow

I agree with previous reviewers (Gely + ZenCity) regarding this cable.  The price was right, set up was easy, and (with the Bitpim program) you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently.  I loaded my whole Outlook calendar and contacts into the phone, as well as some songs, wallpapers, and ringtones.  Don't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from Verizon's sites (VCast and such); just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music/tones that you already own

This is not an "all-in-one" package.  This is JUST the cable and driver.  You will likely need some type of additional software to actually DO anything with the phone.  Check out a freeware program bitpim for that.  I have a VX8300.  The cable works.  The driver works.  Bitpim works

I ordered this cable (two of them actually) to use on the LG 8300.  The driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300.  Once loaded, it found the phone easily.  I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.  

The price of the cable was excellent.  I was unable to locate a data cable locally and was happy to find one on Amazon, even though it was only available through a third party.  All in all, I recommend the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300.  For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to be no driver included for your phone.

I was very pleased when I got this cell phone case. I was really frustrated with my phone before purchasing this case. I kept on getting the screens dirty every time I made a call. Guess I have oily ears or something. No worries now that I have this case.

The things I like about this case:
1.I think it looks cool -- which ... ok does mean something to me.
2.It feels good - it has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth
3. It protects my phone - I have two boys and while they are supposed to not touch "dads phone" it has an almost 100% chance of getting dropped sooner or later. 
4. Its not bulky.
5. Fits the phone 95% perfect.

The things I don't like:
1.Like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the camera a little but not a big deal, camera is not so hot anyhow.
2. Earphone spot is awkward. Functional but not perfect.

So the GOOD far far outwieghs the bad.  I have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best

Got this a couple weeks ago. The rubber suit covers every bit of the phone so I am confident that I won't be getting any scratched. And it flips open a ok. You can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched. You can't access the TF card.

There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isn't going to fall out.

3 minor qualms: The see through plastic has a little glare on it, especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suit. Also, it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock. (noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt). Last, the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the camera. You already know the v710's camera is crap for its specs, but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap. I got used to it real quick

I just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice. It feels solid and professionally made, not some cheap "import special". I like the blue LED light instead of the typical red dot.

Also, the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging.

The IC chip is important so that you don't overcharge your phone battery and shorten it's life.

I would buy again. Great price for a quality charger.

The only problem is that it can only hold the standard battery so your out of luck if you're using the extended battery for your A920 phone. An e-mail to Krusell confirmed this. Other than that, it's a very nice and stylish case for the Samsung A920 phone

I have a 6255i phone and used the cable to connect to a windows XP home system.  The shippment came extremely quick.  Installation was seemless and the drivers from XP worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately.  Downloaded the Nokie suite software from the Nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine.  Cellphone companies wanted 50 bucks for the same cable.  Use this one you will save money and its the same cable

I purchased the cable for my Nokia 6255i. The cable came faster than expected (I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow). The cable came with the software driver (although I did not need it) and worked great with my already installed Nokia Sync software. Electro Island had the best price by far and the service was excellent. I would definitely use them again

The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow

I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand charger I got with the phone.  While it does charge, I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98%.  I am unsure, however, if this is because my battery is less effective than when new.  But, all said, it serves its purpose

This holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with the phone. 

It has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt.

It is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holster. The thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy in/out. The phone clips in solidly and doesn't fall out

This item cost 1 penny (of course the shipping was $4.84), but I thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores.  I've had it for two weeks, and it hasn't broken yet; nor has it dropped the phone accidentally.  Can't go wrong with the price.  Order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters

I've had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now and I just love it! I am very new to all this fancy cell phone stuff, the last one I had was bare bones basic. It is great having a phone that you can do so much with. The camera is so handy since I never remember to take my other camera anywhere with me and the mp3 player and radio are also great to have. The music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it, I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadn't made up my mind until I saw this phone and what an awesome deal it was. You just can't beat a one cent phone with free shipping and $75.00 in rebates! T-Mobile had my old Net10 phone number ported to the new phone in 2 days! The customer service people have been so nice and the ability to buy ringtones, wall paper and myfaves icons right on the phone from T-Zones is awesome. I also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account & plan info right on the phone. I am very impressed. The only issue I have been having is finding accessories for it-my usual discount accessory shops don't have much yet-I'm assuming because the phone is so new, but I'm sure that will get resolved soon. Buy this phone, it is great

yes, it's a tie with the Sony Cybershot K790a for the best multimedia phone so far on the market (at least until the iPhone will show up, then the game is on again). i am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile contract for 2 more years and get this phone for $100 or drop my previous one and get a new contract..

I highly recommend this bundle for the price.  For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travel charger, you get a travel charger, home charger and a USB cable with driver CD.  Everything works just fine.  The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking, so here are my suggestions:  you can use Windows Media Player to move music over to your phone using the Sync feature, and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file transfers between your PC and phone.

Some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine, but they were unable to get the data cable to work. However, I found no such problems, and successfully used the data cable to transfer files off of my phone. After installing the drivers, just search the web for a program called BitPim. It's not exactly the nicest looking software, but gets the job done.

Dear all

I have been using this piece for the last one year and its quite a decent one.It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed. 
An ample speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handy at times.
MP3 player is so gud...but had to purchase an addition mem card.
I recently had a problem with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by T mobile..which makes it trust at ruining times..
Thanks for tmobile and amazon...

Hope this help

If you want a cell phone that is well made, looks good, feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the V360 is an excellent choice.  It has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that I don't want.  it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use

I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlocked/unbranded and it was of the quad-band variety.  Here's my take:

PROS:
-Durability; this thing was built with the clumsy in mind (like me).  I must have dropped this thing a dozen times and there's barely a scratch.

-MP3 player; I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke, but with the cost of TranshFlash memory coming down (I bought my 512MB chip on eBay for $7.99) then upgrading is easy and affordable.  That being said, the MP3 player is a feature you will actually USE, and the sound quality is good.  I've had no problem with playing my iTunes music (as long as they're mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality then it will play fine.) **Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats - you need to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either program to rip to mp3 format (you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menu)

-Programmable "smart keys"; I read where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side, it was the camera icon button on the front keypad.  He must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the "Personalize" menu. Not only that, but you can rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps.  It's a handy little feature.

-Built in Bluetooth and EDGE technology.  You may not use these features out-of-the box, but they're for the time when these technologies are more commonplace.  I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files (mp3's, pics, etc) to my phone with my laptop.

-Quad-Band World Phone capable.  This phone works on 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 GSM networks (although that has not been personally tested).  However, I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and I'll know for certain by then.

CONS:
-There's a slight delay when you answer a call - I usually have to say "hello" 2-3 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak.  I don't know if this is a carrier problem or the phone.  (I use Cingular prepaid).

-The light stays on while charging (even when the phone is powered off).  It's annoying.

-The onboard memory is a joke.  You really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone.

-It has a monochrome outer display (full color inside).  This doesn't bother me at all, but it's not as flashy as Razr or other phones.

OVERALL:
This is a great, durable little phone with handy features I think people will actually use.  I've read where people complain about the picture quality - but that's what a digital camera is for.  If you want a good quality cell phone that's well designed, user friendly, and doesn't look like a tricked-out teenager's phone, then this is the phone for you.

This is a good solid phone so far.  Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual.  My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory.  Despite having something like five Meg of memory on the phone and a Micro SD memory card, that's it.  The size of the text message doesn't seem to matter

This is a great phone that I've used for a year now.  I'd like to highlight the standout features that make this phone unique, especially at its price.

MP3 player.  Just get an adapter for the usb port (a few bucks on eBay) and you can plug in your stereo headphones.  Too bad they haven't offered an update to the Motorola Digital Audio Player.

MicroSD slot.  You can take a MicroSD card, put it into the included adapter and plug into an SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s (you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtone, cropping it will make it more effective), 3GP videos (animation looks great, but the sound was slightly out of sync, search the web for video converters to convert your content), or pictures.  I love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them.

Bluetooth.  I got an Explorer 320 headset for $20 and it works great with it.

Battery.  Easily exchangeable.  Easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one.  The battery life isn't very long, so it's good to have a spare battery, they're cheap.

Video camera. Not high quality video, but its something the old RAZR couldn't do.

Customization.  I love customization.  You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone, the two on the top of the keypad, and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone.  It even has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features.  You can easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper.  Also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique.

Speakerphone.  Works even when closed.  Good for using automated phone menu systems and when you're put on hold.  The speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s.  The plastic may resonate at certain sounds though.

Vibrating alert.  VIBE THEN RING!  Why doesn't every phone have this??  It should be the default standard for all phones.  The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket.  If you are one to show off your ringtone, let it move onto ring, otherwise be descreet and answer immediately.

-----------------------------------------------------------

As for what I don't like.  I don't care much for the Motorola menu style.  I prefer Sanyo and Samsung interfaces.  The menu is the same as a RAZR or SLVR.  All the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off.  I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit.  I scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldn't look half worn off.

-----------------------------------------------------------

All the great features is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509 or other more expensive phones.  This phone just has all the fee-free features you could want

    I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headset and find it more than adequate. For the price, it is worth every penny. The ability of using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect. Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick. Once they finally die, your headset is useless. Too expensive to send away to repair. So you throw your headset and charger away and buy a new one. That is good for a company but not for you.
   Depending on your ear structure the fit can be either formfitting or loose. From reading the other reviews here one can infer this. For me it is formfitting. Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or device it pairs to would make a difference in performance. Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static. For me and others, we experienced no such problem. 
   Best bet is to check the return policy if you find that it doesn't meet your standards. But if it works for your device, you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talk time on 1 AAA Alkaline battery!. And you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea. If it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner

The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)

I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.

The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear.

It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery.

The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.

Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.

This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them. I use rechargeable NiMH AAA's, and they just last a really long time with this unit

I bought this headset for internet chats with my husband, when he travels for business. I find it comfortable to wear and easy to use.  The sound quality is good, volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo.

I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a charger. All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies. (Even rechargeables do not last forever.) 

The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear. It would be nice if it bent for a custom fit, but I am pretty happy with it

I purchased this headset (...)and the key features I like are as follows:

1. AAA Battery - no charging!
2. Easy to pair with my phone (Motorola SLVR L7 - European Version)
3. No static on both ends.
4. Have not had a complaint about "echoes" as other reviews stated.
5. Price - affordable but acts like an expensive headset.
6. Volume is good.
7. Fits well, does not feel lose.
8. 22 Hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced.

I am very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset

I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best. Customer Service is as good as the product. There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest. Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price. The rating should be a 10

This charger is an excellent value. It works beautifully with my Treo 700p smartphone. I love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button, making the whole unit quick and easy to store. The only complaint I've heard is that the large, blue power light is too bright at night. It doesn't annoy me, but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down, so the blue glow doesn't shine up into her eyes. No problem

Very nice product. The retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone. My complaint with all Palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connector and they break. But the price on this one is good enough that you should buy 2.

This is an excellent product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hiding its style. I chose Treo because of its unique look and excellent features however, the case from Palm didn't work for me because I use the phone a lot and I dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime.  So, it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it.  I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phone while in it, it hides the Treo's real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag.  This one seems to even enhance the Treo's style

Good battery life (certainly much better than the old one it replaced).  For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original.  However it doesn't fit quite as snugly in the dock-style charger that came with my phone (not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone, but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly).  That is a little annoying that it tends to fall out -- if I'm not paying attention I'll wake up the next morning and my phone won't actually have been charged -- but it still works

The cable is exactly what I needed, and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives. Drivers provided on the accompanying CD worked but were not as complete as I would have liked. I am still very satisfied, as it was only the cable that I was really after, especially for the price at which I bought it

The vehicle phone charger I received was not the one pictured as for sale.  It does, however, appear to be equal in features.  I trust it will function as described.  
__________________________________

I have now used this product and find that it does not work to charge my V170 cell phone.  The car's power outlet does work.  I have since purchased the Motorola charger - more expensive - and it works perfectly.  I should have done this in the first place

You might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind. I am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if I know what I am getting is not just a counterfeit. I think I got my money's worth

After reading reviews here & "user forum's" I decided to purchase this 
Desktop Charging Station. 
It can charge a secondary battery in the rear compartment AND can charge
the extended life batteries as well while the Q is on the charger.
The "three color" LED indicator is added benefit, w/a simple guide 
that is located underneath the unit.
The charger can not "over-charge" the battery which is an added benefit.
And, you can easily access the Q while on the charger for SMS texts, using any app., or even using the speaker phone while on the desktop charger

I simply wanted a data cable to connect my Verizon cell phone to my Macintosh so I could transfer and synchronize data. Verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on Windows machines. This thrifty cable (&lt; $10) worked perfectly. With the Mac-friendly DataPilot software

I have tried a dozen screen guards, some of them shine a lot, some of them are not as clear as they promise, some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble. This makes its way through all that problems. Well on the other hand it does have a catch
1. Finger print magnet
2. The price - THAT PRICE FOR ONE!!!
And yea the best part is its static not gum, and its washable.

The touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice. The onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen (easier sad than done). If anything does attach, it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer

But it does have some faults. I have had it for some time now, I got it for my 11th birthday. I have reviewed the cingular version too, even though mines verizon.

FAULTS:
Very short battery life - I have to charge it almost every day!
Camera - The picture you take can't move or it comes out all messed up.

GOOD PARTS:
Big screen - Easy to read!
Recording videos - Even though you get 15 seconds, I still use that to make funny videos with my friends.
It's style - I love the color and style! My friends are all jealous.

Overall, I think it's a great phone

Personally, I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its "functionality" you are buying the wrong phone.  I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not be as small, light, and attractive as Motorola phones, LG phones are built to last. However, if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carry in your purse/pocket and to use just as a nice looking phone, this is a great one to own.

I previously had the LG VX9800 before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c.  I had the VX9800 because when I was in college I would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes.  That phone was incredible.  However, now that I am in the working world and basically only use my phone to call people, I wanted a phone that was easier to carry around and was "cute".  Enter the Razr.  I don't recommend this phone if your phone is your life--it doesn't do much.  However, if you are just going to be using it to make calls and send the occasional text, it's wonderful.  The pink color that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeous--it's almost a purpley-pinkish lavendar color.  In my opinion, this pink is prettier than the T-Mobile magenta and much much much nicer than the Cingular pink (I am not a fan of that one at all).

In essence, if you're looking for a high-tech phone, this is not it.  If you're looking for a lightweight, attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting, this is a great buy

I just got my pink razr phone and I love it so far. i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones. Even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you can see it ,still it works well. I was scared to buy this phone because I read some of the reviews and some of them weren't saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it. Great job motorola keep up the good work

When I first got my Motorola Q I was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying battery in mid day.  With some setting changes and the 1700 mAh battery that is now far in the past.  For the price, it is an excellent deal.

Younger brother just got the verizon chocolate.  He's been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up.  Its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but I digress. The screen protect works as described, it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator.  The film has some kind of electrostatic polymer, there's no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen.  Squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed.  
I would recommend

I like this case very much for my Blackberry.  It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when I'm using it as a phone.  It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse.  My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases.  (Come on guys!  Women use these items too!)  Also, the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that I've had this case.  Other than those two things, this is a great, not bulky case.

I use my belt holster with all the phones i've owned, my i530 is no
exception. This belt holster feels really well made, it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard I use it. A big plus is that I can use my phone while it's in the holster

An extra Lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone. The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts.  It saves time and one last thing to worry about. The charge itself is fast too..
I have found the 750 mah Lithium Ion Battery to be dependable nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging.  It doesn't weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range. 
However, the first time you charge or recharge your Lithium battery is the most important charge of all.  You must let the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery.  The "deader" the battery on it's first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come.
Highly recommended

I love my Nextel i530.  Purchased it almost a year ago now.  I am in northern Ohio and travel many places around the state.  No matter where I have gone, and I take my phone everywhere with me, I have yet to find a place where my phone doesn't have Nextel service.  Also, very durable phone.  I live on a farm here, and we use the two-way often to communicate.  My phone in particular has been dropped several times, once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below, and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud.  Still works like new.  I am extremely happy with Nextel's service and phones.  I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also can't complain.  I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon, Alltel, Cingular, and Sprint.  Other companies have such cheap phones it seems.  It's a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged - from my experience with Sprint, they are terrible with no service anywhere, and their phones suck too

I have used the i530 for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit, or with NEXTEL's service.  To simplify your reading, here is a list of pros and cons.

Cons:  A little chunky; Lacks up to date features and tech (such as color screen, external display, etc.); Battery life is nothing to write home about.

Pros:  Durability (been dropped off a roof, still going strong); Looks (yellow model); Call quality is excellent; Good speakerphone; Digital 2-way is a great feature.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my i530.  The only issue among the cons that is of any real concern is the battery life, but this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones - perhaps due to the nature of the iDEN network on which they operate.  Even after two years, my original battery lasts more than a day with moderate use.  A pain?  Slightly, but given the advantages of NEXTEL, its worth remembering to charge up more often.  Please beware of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below - my experience with their coverage, customer service, etc. has been very positive.  Just make sure you do your homework with respect to coverage before you sign up with any wireless company.  Go with the one that gives the best coverage in the areas in which you live, work, or travel.  It's always best to actually put the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone.  Some providers are overly optimistic.  NEXTEL's maps are pretty legit, at least as far as I have discovered

	For two years now I have not had any problems with my Motorola i530 cell phone, which is serviced by Telus-Nextel.  Over all I would rate the service as good, not excellent.  Rarely I will have trouble getting service in a area where I would normally get a strong signal.  This problem will normally last for roughly under a minute before my phone is once again operational.  I'm a daily commuter  between Canada and the United States.  My phone doesn't miss a beat, it will automatically switch from Telus a Canadian server to Nextel an American server and still have the same great reception.  
	The cell phone itself is big, bulky, heavy, and ugly.  It does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or video features.  It does have a direct connect feature so you can use your phone like a walky-talky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone.  That is neat and fun.  The reception on the phone is clear and crisp, it will seldom cut out of the conversation.  Therefore I did not expect the quality of the sound of down loaded music to be so poor.
	What is most impressive is the phones durability.  This cell phone can really take a beating.  I have dropped my phone numerous times.  I have thrown my phone across a room to a friend who failed to catch it more then once.  One of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces.  On a road trip, my phone had fallen off my lap, out of the car and sat on the side of the road for three days in the rain.  I finally backtracked and relocated my phone.  I had recharged the phone and it worked as expected.  My phone has never let me down, I have always gotten service, and the battery has not died on me thus far.  The battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderate usage.
	If you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishment and do not desire all of those new phone gimmicks this phone is for you.

This is the 5th Palm treo case I have bought in the last few years, and it is the best by far.  It holds the treo snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap.  The clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot.  It is slim and works great

I'm very happy with this case.  I was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my Treo 700p, but would allow complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it.  In other words, I didn't want something that was attached to the Treo permanently.  This did the trick.  It's simple, but looks good.  Seems to be solidly made as well

I have the i850, but the i560 is what my wife has been using for about 3 months.  The phone is so good, my 2 year old can't destroy it! (he's tried)  There's only 3 things I don't like about it: it doesn't have a very big screen, the external screen isn't color, and it has no camera.  Other than that it's pretty much the same as the higher priced models like the i850... and holding them together I suspect that they in fact have the same electronics inside, minus the 3 things I mentioned above.  If you don't take pic's this really is the phone for you!  You can even submerge this thing in water, and it will still work without needing anything special!  It has GPS built in, and all the java apps.  It's everything the higher priced models have minus the camera and a smaller screen.  Even though the screen is smaller, it's color, and very legible

Motorola i560 vs i710

The Motorola i560 is nicely sized, easy to use, and indestructible.  These features are what to look for when looking for a new cell phone.  Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones, such as the i710, but it is the unbreakable model with outside display.  This is something new for the unbreakable model.

Size is important, especially with Nextel, because most of their early models are very big and awkward, like the i710.  The i560 is perfectly in between massive and tiny.  This is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas.  It is equipped with gripping as well which helps when it comes to using the direct connect, placing calls, and receiving calls.  The i710 has a very smooth exterior.  It is nice looking, but is harder to keep in your hand.  More damage is done to the i710 because there is no gripping.  If, however, the i560 does slip out of your hands, don't worry.  Dropping this phone is not a concern due to extreme durability.  If you are worried about scratching the outside, get a leather or plastic cover for it.

The ease of use between the i560 and the i710 is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicity; however, the big difference is in the outside display on the i560.  Without even opening the phone, you can place a call by pushing the stop butt at the top of the phone and scroll through your most recent calls.  This is a safe feature to use in the car.  Speaker phone clarity improved for the i560.  The i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word, where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspect, but an improvement is better than nothing.  

Durability for a cell phone is essential.  There is nothing worse than having to take a cell phone in for repair, or even worse, having to replace it.  As much use as most people get out of their cell phones, how it stands up to daily wear and tear is vital to satisfaction with a phone.  The i560 is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel, and is exceptionally tough.  When the i710 is dropped, it often goes to a blank screen and causes problems with reception and service.  The i560 is completely opposite.  

Overall performance, mass, and resilience of the i560 surpasses the i710.  When compared, the i560 is a better choice.

My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with Cingular, so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do.  Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons so far (after a week).

PROS (in order of coolness, best first):
1. Nextel's Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear.  
2. Any call, either DirectConnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed.  You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them.  
3. If you're concerned about radio (RF) radiation - and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore, this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you (and improves the transmission).  
4. The speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be, even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system (very impressive). There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone (full duplex).  You can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to. 
5. The phone is a little wider than some phones (like the V60), but is very light.  Yet the phone meets the tough Military specs.
6. Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my medium-sized hand. Phone has slight hourglass shape (wider at the bottom) to fit nicely into the hand.
7. Charger charges the battery FAST...MUCH faster than my V60 ever charged.
8. Phone has all the standard stuff I love and couldn't live without: voice dialing, custom rings for calls from my contact list, handsfree, long recent calls list (up to 20), ability to store number to Contacts from recent calls (without having to key the number, just have to enter the name). 

CONS (in order of annoyance, worst first):
1. The phone is almost completely made of plastic, and I've never thought plastic was as durable as metal. While Motorola makes truly awesome phones, I worry there might be an over-reliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone.
2. When the phone is in the holster, the outside display is not visible, forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see who's calling (for those that don't have a custom ring configured) or to check the time.  Very annoying, as I'm used to using my phone as a watch.
3. The icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons.  The only two parts that are clear: the battery (important) and date/time.
4. The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone (where you connect the charger, etc) make me think that someday I'm going to look down there and find it missing. It's easy enough to pop off, but sometimes takes "persuading" to put back and have it cover the slot completely (because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec).

OVERALL, I really like the phone and highly recommend it to all

The cover design is well made based on the requirements. The problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides. In my opinion, compared to all other covers, this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the case

I've had the battery for about a week now. Simply love it. I'm a heavy user of GPS Applications and Power Vision for web-surfing on the go. I used to charge the phone twice a day, now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even forget to plug it in at night and I still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day. Even when i forget to charge it hasn't died on me.

This is a great deal at $16 + shipping vs. the one sold at Sprint stores for around $60

I'm very happy with this purchase overall.  This battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone. Talk time and internet time are increased greatly.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast.  Though that is still better than the original battery.  It may just be the phone. I have no idea if it is as good as the one Sprint sells for 60 dollars.  It is definitely worth 20 bucks all day long

Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900, making it less high-maintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing, headset using, and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time.  Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind.  It's been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars.  What!?  Aside from the piddling cost of this battery (which is about double the tax you'd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership), there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside.  To me, this is not insignificant, but is ignorable, as it doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing, talking, or using the buttons

The only complaint I had about my a900 was the battery life.  I am on conference calls a lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly.  With this extended battery I am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly.  Totally worth the $15, plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping

The Samsung A900 is a great phone - a Motorola Razr on steroids. (That is, it's much more durable than the Razr.) 

BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL!!!  You literally have to charge this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time.

NOT ANY MORE!  The Bargaincell price was so low, I was skeptical.   PERISH THE THOUGHT!  I got the battery on time; it was VERY well packaged.  It fit the phone PERFECTLY, as did the COVER it came with.

I plugged it in and let it charge completely.  I then used the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge!  WHOO HOO!!!!  BRAVO BARGAINCELL!

BY THE WAY - Even though this is a somewhat "thick" battery, it is  SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE: It does NOT add the "bulk" you might think, looking at its picture.  In fact, I think the phone actually looks BETTER with the larger battery.  I have a leather Bytech carry case designed for the Razr/A900.  It's a tight fit now, but I'm sure the case will stretch much like a new shoe does after it's been worn a few days.

DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY ONE OF THESE BATTERIES!!

The samsung A900 Blade is an excellent phone. I can say so many good things about it. The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid battery life. And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint. Nobody wants to charge their phone between 2-4 times a day. With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times. But that's what you get with a razor thin phone. So of course I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial. This battery is a life saver. Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found, and I did extensive searching. Also this one comes with the door which is very crucial. I've seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door. You would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery. What would you do, put a rubber band around it? Heck no. Well anyway, now that I have this battery, my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries. My A-900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little. Don't worry, you're phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all it's features without dying

I initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained about,until I applied the FIX: Palm has identified that the Treo 680 device can experience reduced battery life when the camera is used. The camera may continue to draw power from the battery when the device is in standby mode. Treo 680 users should install the Treo 680 Camera Update to address this issue.[...

I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months (Including, Cingular HTC 8125, and Nokia E62)  and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned.   The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system ( albeit, less powerful) and much more customizable and synchronization-friendly than the Symbian OS.  Its great for easy installation of software.

Pros:
- Very customizable interface, making the phone very user friendly. You can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button. 
- Palm OS is easy to use, and thus, you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone, unlike Windows Mobile, which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS, but cumbersome and difficult to use at times. 
- You can use this as a one handed phone...very important for people like me who like to drive and text/email. 
- Perfect size, weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear. 
The lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement.
-  Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop 
- Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you, which is very useful  (although limits battery life) 


Cons:
- Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones.  I have to charge my phone every night, and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet, 30 minutes of mp3 player, autoretrieve email every 30 min,  and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions.    If you have it set on auto-retrieve for your email, the battery life seems to decrease impressively.    The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently.
- You cant plug in your own headsets into the device ( like your iPod headphones)  you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm. I hate that. 



I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm, instead of from Cingular.  I got it for 350$  with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included. Also,  if you get it from Cingular, they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone.  

OVERALL:  extremely satisfied with this easy to use, highly customizable, powerful smartphone, despite a somewhat shorter battery life.

I had a Palm TX which I loved, but didn't like having to go to WiFi sites for the web. I also had a Moto V557 phone which is the best cell phone I've ever owned.  I purchased the Treo for the best of both worlds.

I like the Treo 680, but I had to read all of the instructions, call customer service and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone.  For example, I had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button. (Which I usually missed while in a rush to answer the phone.)

I like the web because it's fast enough that I don't miss the WiFi.  I had to get used to the fact that many web sites aren't small enough for the phone, but it's excellent for using Google maps, looking up business and giving the number for easy dial (just tap the blue line), checking bank accounts, online orders, movies, weather and especially the news.  Email is good too with the Palm software. I didn't use Express or GetGood email.  I absolutely love the chat setting on the messaging.

Now, the phone is another story. I miss the ease of dialing a traditional cell.  My Bluetooth does not work well with the 680. People typically tell me that they can't hear me so I now use a corded ear bud.  The Bluetooth doesn't work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately.  You can't insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions.  There is no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial a number.  You have to leave the phone dialing page and return to redial.  The phone dials slowly if there are other programs running. And lastly, you can't check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone. You have to hang up with the person, unlock the phone, check the calendar and call them back.

The battery life is poor, but I keep a charger in the car which helps a great deal.

All in all, I love my Treo 680. I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommend. They are: Launcher X(excellent), Mobil Write, Treo Voice Dialing, The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows.

I also recommend that you keep you Treo locked with a security password.  I have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this $400 phone

When I first got my phone, I was quite excited.  It had more memory than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated.  From my research, I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours.
1)I had to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th.  This patch can be found on Palm support site.

2) I needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours.

Once I did these two things, my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge, and I've set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive.  This is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive.

I've had no problems with any of my SD cards or mini-SD cards.  The increase internal memory also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo.  I've heard the various complaints, but you have to work through some of them.  it is a great phone

Upgrading from the Treo 650, it is true that there isn't much new. Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and non-megapixel camera leave one frustrated. But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market, particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee.

So I accept the current Palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries. Not elegant, but it works. That doesn't mean that I won't tell Palm "Guys get your act together and come out with something far better!

I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didn't want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear. I took a chance on this headset even though I read a review saying that it didn't sync up well with the VX8300. I couldn't be more happy. Even though it is small(about 1-1/2") the buttons are still large enough to use with ease. It also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works well with my VX8300.

Well I read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here, but I decided to take the plunge and go for it.  Well I'm glad I did.  All I can say is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the get-go.  It has its flaws but what phone doesn't?  The question is whether you're going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you.  Most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me.  Let's talk about the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Call quality is excellent. No static what so ever.  No dropped calls.  My area has good T-mobile coverage so I can't complain.  As a phone it does what it's supposed to do.  Make good quality calls.  It also pairs with my bluetooth headset (Plantronics 510) really well.  Speaker phone is of good quality too.

2. Internet works great. I have the $5.99 plan and yes EDGE isn't the fastest but it gets the job done.  It doesn't matter where I'm at I can check my email, finds restaurants or directions, or just surf the web when I'm bored.  It really came in handy when I was out on vacation and lost.  WiFi works well too.  Didn't want to fork out the money for hotspots though.

3. The camera at 1.3 megapixels is decent quality.  No it's not going to replace my regular camera but I found it really handy when I forgot to take my camera to my friend's wedding, but was still able to take quality pictures.  I haven't tried videos yet though.

4. Mp3/Video player: Now the speakers on this phone aren't the greatest so I wouldn't use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headset it sounds pretty good.  I bought a 2GB microSD card bought here at Amazon and now I can hold a ton music and movies.  Videos looks pretty nice I'd have to admit.  This thing is my travelinig entertainment center.  I even found a way to play original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying Mike Tyson's Punchout like back in the old days.

5. Calendar/schedule: I had a PDA but for some reason I'm more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedule on this thing than I did with my Pocket PC.  Probably because of convenience reasons.

6. Smartphone applications: I'm in the medical field and I keep all my medical applications on this phone.  I can quickly look up drug references or research diseases.  I really thought I'd need a touchscreen in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus, I don't find that it's all that necessary and still navigate pretty well. I just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps, but it's more than adequate. And I'm not sure why people don't think there are a lot of programs for the smartphone.  Programs written for WM5 are compatable with PPC as well as smartphones equally. [...].

7. Appearance: Everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do I.  It looks great and feels great.  I saw this side by side with the Motorola Q and the Q just looked so much bulkier and...well... not as nice.  The rubber backing feels awesome.

8. Battery: For all that I use this phone for it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spare which is all I can really ask for.  I wouldn't go 2 days without charging the battery though. You should charge it every night.

Cons:

1. Windows Mobile 5: Mighty Microsoft needs to write a cleaner program. However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will be free to download for T-Mobile customer soon so hopefully that'll take care of some of the problems.  I swear just to turn on the bluetooth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate WM5.

2. Volume strip: Yeah like everyone says it sucks.  I disabled mine.  Adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best.  Luckily my music/video programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume so it's not such an issue for me.

3. Alarm clock: Now I don't use this all that much but I see what everyone says about it and yeah it's a pretty idiotic written program.  However rather than writing half a page on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now goes on.

Summary: So I use this device to make quality phone calls, surf the web, check email, play games, listen to music, watch movies, monitor my schedule, check my medical references, and take decent quality pictures.  All this thing needs now is a laser beam that will cut through metal and it'd be the greatest gadget known to man

I was carrying a PDA and a Razr cell phone. When I got this phone I gave my PDA to my brother and my Razr to my daughter. I love the full contact list with addresses, all the phone numbers and notes that are in my Outlook and it syncs with Outlook. The calendar is really nice and that too syncs with Outlook. I don't try to use it for browsing the internet, but I do use T-mobiles T-zones to collect all my email from all my various email address types. It took some learning to find the easiest way to get to everything, but it's there is you look, called and received numbers with one key press, extremely easy contact look up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a push or two away. It has EVERYTHING that any cell phone has and works as well or better and easier. The speaker phone is great and one touch (or speed) dialing is great. I can store hundreds of phone numbers at numbers I choose, then use the spot number to make a call instead of looking up numbers (ie: Lee's cell is spot 5, home spot 15, office spot 25) I found a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phone. Coverage with T-mobile is as good as any. Some areas I have service where friends with other providers don't and some areas they have service I don't. All in all, I find that I have service across the country without much trouble and I drive. If you have T-mobile cell service, their t-zones for email and many other internet based services is only $5 and WiFi service is only $20 (monthly), can't beat that. The full keyboard makes text messaging and keeping notes MUCH easier and more fun. It's not a full PDA, but it does everything I did with my PDA. It's way more than a phone, really small and thin, easy to carry, easy to lock and unlock the keyboard. It takes nice pictures for emergencies if I don't have my camera and it uses a mini SD card, which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos. Personally, I can't think of a negative thing about it. It's not a laptop computer, but I think it's the best cell phone on the market. My cousin has the blackberry and he's jealous of me and my Dash

I've had multiple PDA's that have crashed and multiple phones in the past.  I had a great Nokia phone, but wanted to combine into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago.  So far, I've had no issues with service.  Been able to make and receive phone calls, call clarity is excellent and with TMobile, I have service in my office unlike other co-workers phones.  Everyone is jealous - their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking.  I really enjoy having the email and internet feature.  The only issue I've had at all is with the volume control - when I'm surfing the net or playing ball breaker, I hold the phone and often hit the volume control.  Everything else works as described and I'm very happy with my choice.

When I was looking to combine my phones, I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews, I picked this one.  I'm very happy I did.

This is my first SmartPhone and I've had a lot of fun with it so far.  For being so small, the keys are remarkably easy to use.  I often connect it to my laptop via a USB cable.  If you have Windows XP along with MS ActiveSync 4.2.0, your PC/laptop will recognize it as a network device.  A little bonus app on the Dash lets you share the Internet connection (granted you have the data plan) at no extra cost.

If you get the add-on micro SD card (about $80), you'll have no need to buy an iPod.  Windows Media Player (which comes standard) works just as well.

It has a built in 802.11b (or g?) card.  When I'm in range of wi-fi, I can use Skype and save my minutes.  I hope T-Mobile doesn't read this since they'll probably patch that loophole :)

A few of the cons:

-There is no scroll wheel like on the Blackberry.

-The battery charge doesn't last longer than a day or so if you've got data push to Outlook enabled.  If I forget to charge it at night, I'm SOL.

-The volume strip on the righthand side drives me nuts.  I'm constantly hitting it by mistake.  When I do, an annoying popup interrupts whatever I'm doing.  You can disable the volume strip, but it's kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player.  A simple classic volume dial on the side would be a huge improvement.  The strip never seems to work right when I really intend to adjust the volume.

-The keyboard is nice, but a touch screen would be better for certain apps.  There's no way to cut-and-paste

I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable. I put a 1 gig memory card in it. Right now, I have a 140,000 word dictionary on it, the NIV bible, Star Wars, many videos of my son, about 100 wma songs, and a ton of pictures. It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts, appts, tasks, and emails are always up to date. It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset. It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The camera takes decent pictures and video. One of the best features is the battery life. For all it does it lasts an incredibly long time. I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price. I like it waaaay better than the treo, blackberries, Q, or any other qwerty device. It's glued to my hip and I use it all the time. I love it!!

A very good product. For traveling people with GPRS Internet access.  The charger is good when you are away of power.
The MPT version is Ok but more value is for seem editing (for professional and expert users only)

The headset works fine, people who I talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well, but I doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time, also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset

After trying this phone out a few days here are my personal results

Pros
1. What attracted me to this phone were the fitness features, flip phone design and the rugged design. So far I like the pedometer/running tools. You have to calibrate it manually if you want the best results, but right out of the box it's been okay so far. 
2. I've had other mp3 cell phones (LG VX8500 Chocolate, Samsung SCH-A930, Motorola SLVR L7) and this one blows all of the others out in this category. Granted this is not going to contend with the iPod but for a cell phone the Walkman abilities are impressive.
3. User Interface. By far the cleanest and most intuitive I've used. But then I guess almost anything is an upgrade over the Verizon OS.

Cons
1. I can't stand the armband that came with this. The length of the headphones cord is way too long for running, at least for me personally. It's taken me a few times to figure out something comfortable in terms of cord management.
2. Button layout. My hands aren't big by any means but I still have trouble with some of the dedicated buttons (Walkman, Internet, Shortcuts, Power On/Off). 
3. 2 Megapixel camera. I said I don't use the camera feature often and i'm glad I don't for this camera. This has the be the most stripped down, barebones 2 megapixel camera I have used. 


Overall I must say that I am satisfied with my purchase; I'm still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phone. I had the choice between this and the W810i for the same price at the Sony Store and I opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and I must say that these two features haven't let me down yet, otherwise I would've gone for the W810

So I welcome myself to the more powerful world of the Cell Phones.  I've been a fan of Sony Ericsson's phones after I've seen what they really do and when I had the Z500a long time back when I won the phone during hurricane season, I thought the phone was great.  My only thoughts were that despite the phone being a Flip Phone and having a "Music Player" that the phone only had 15MB of space to begin with and to top it off, its camera wasn't great.  Thanks Sony for your answer.

I have already made a few quick station buttons on the W710 and the best part is that I feel original with the fact that I'm the only one that has it in my school and among my friends.  Most people I've seen the only chance they have is getting the W810 and while that phone looks ok, the W710 just fits me right.  The phone's color scheme, the style of the phone, the phone's technogeekness (for those of us who love technology), and the fact that many people (namely the girls) find it a cute phone (Don't know weather that is good or not, but at least it attracts some attention).  The fact that the phone's user interface is for the most part the same as every phone from SE, it makes it that much easier to learn the phone's buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old Z500.  With 2GB of expanded memory that I put in it and the phone's already 17MB of internal space, the phone has many possibilities!  And the last part before I go is that with the fact its an Active phone, you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day, check your training, and more! It even gives you rewards for being active.

So for those needing a nice looking phone, want walkman power for mp3's and FM Radio, knowing your fitness activity, this is the phone for you

Note:  I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710i's features work in comparison. I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function.  My son's Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not. Review is based on 1 week of usage.

I've also purchased the z710i for my son and will review that one later.

Strengths: 
*Improved picture quality of 2.0 megapixels vs. 1.3
*Excellent voice quality with headsets (wired or bluetooth)
*Text, SMS, MMS
*shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features
*Battery life is outstanding
*mp3 player
*RSS reader
*Bluetooth synchronization of files
*Ability to set up phone in non-english languages
*Ability to buy an international SIM card to avoid extra fees
*Sync cord charges the battery
*Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable (if you don't have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big $$$)
*FM radio - reception is so-so in the downtown area
*standard or flight mode option to use while on airplane
*Edge technology - my p10i did not have this.  I can download email extremely quickly now!!!
*step counter & calories expended

Neutral: 
*The international charger with an adapter for US outlets.  It is very wobbly in the outlet.  I'll invest in a US version.
*Inability to sync with any computer using Windows Vista (I'm sure a workaround is coming)
*I haven't used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounter's accuracy.
*Others have warned about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna, I haven't had a problem with this.
*Over-the-ear earbuds don't fall out!

Weaknesses: 
*Since I have other Sony phones, I am disappointed that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger.  Translation, you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones. 
*There is no way to charge the phone and use the wired headset. You either listen to the radio or charge the phone.
* You can not use the standard over-the-counter headsets because there is no outlet for it.
*Need to switch settings to view more than one email account
*Yet another memory card format (micro)another adapter needed
*Memory card only 512mb (can purchase 1 or 2gb)
*picture caller id only works after you open the phone (edit March 21,2007 - if you have answer on open set)


I purchased my W710i from an internet company for $254.00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days. I'm unsure if I can provide their name here.

Overall: Sony has always produced quality products. I love this phone and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone. I do miss using my styllus.  If you don't need the bells and whistles of a smartphone, go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender.


If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I would even though I haven't tried all of the features of this phone.  Buy it without hesitation!

ADDENDUM March 5, 2007

I dropped the phone on a tiled bathroom floor.  When it hit, the clip, battery cover and battery scattered in different directions on the floor.  Amazingly, the phone still operates.  The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone.  A mark like that could happen in my purse!

I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again!

The mp3 player is simple to use, accessible while the phone is closed, and sounds great.  You can use any headsets or earbuds you prefer, and the radio makes it the device of choice for gym-rats or runners alike.  Sturdy, fairly easy to figure out, and fine reception.  A great phone if you don't need "smartphone" features

The original battery never lasted an entire day if I talked very much.  With this replacement battery, I never run out of power anymore.  I do charge it every night. The battery is a little bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip.  The new battery comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly

I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer. I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned. The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didn't intend but it's really not that big of a deal; I just need to re-train my hands. I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality. The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task

This phone is incredible, and I'm so happy I bought it through Amazon...very good deal and smooth transaction! I definitely recommend getting this phone. Here's my run-down of it:

Pros:
Excellent voice quality
Excellent sound quality
Great reception...even in places that were "dead zones" with my other phones.
Very compact and oh so sexy sleek
Decent battery life (MUCH better than RAZR)
Easy to follow menu

Cons:
Front side is a fingerprint magnet from hell
Small screen
No warranty available with Cingular
Only a few backgrounds & ringtones to choose from without downloading your own

I also bought the data cable package through Amazon, and it worked beautifully from the first try.

I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations. I will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews...

Music portability, awesome. With the cable that came with my girlfriend's V3i I have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone. There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not transfer, blah blah blah, but there have been only very few songs with any problem. I have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2GB mico card I bought and it has been great. The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for the size. Playlists will also continue to play when the phone is closed, which I found a very nice and convenient touch. 

I re-upped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal reception, which is nothing to sneeze at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR, so I didn't have some POS crap phone prior to the KRZR. As with RAZRs, you have to be careful not to hit the internet button (i wish you could lock keys like on Nokia), but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that. Overall a great phone. I wish Motorola provided you with a disk full of programs INCLUDED with the phone like I was able to get with my Nokia 7610, but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself. Some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on RAZRs and KRZRS, but for an average size guy with average sized hands, this has not been a problem at all. SO FAR, SO VERY GOOD

I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wireless's "New Every Two" program.  My main gripe with the phone is that, unlike my former phone (Motorola V265), it cannot be set to display the time in the 24-hour format (I do not use am/pm).  Otherwise, the screen is nice and bright, it's easy to use, it's much less bulky than my former phone, and the voice activation is easier

I switched to this phone from Verizon e815. Some of the details I find different:

Pros:
Sleek design
Good battery life
Compact
2MP camera

Cons:
Choppy voice sometimes hard to listen
Screen and buttons little small

Works for me as I don't use the phone for internet/email or use lot other features

For the price... this cover is great. It's thin, easy to dial through and see through, easy to get it on and off. No complaints. I just wish I had it sooner... before i dropped the phone and cracked the screen. I HAVE dropped it since getting this cover and it was just fine

I've used this model headset for 6 months, and the sound quality is great. I drive a truck for a living, and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck. The "windstop" technology works good. I wear it about 6-7 hours a day. The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort. Only problem is it disconnects sometimes at "rest". It beeps when it disconnects, and reconnects automatically, usually within a minute or two. Would (and have) recommended to friends

I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product, but that's not to say that that the product is not without some flaws.  The reception, clarity, and battery life is quite good.  Also, my hearing isn't the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and don't have to strain to hear.  My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit.  I've gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on, but it's still very annoying at times.  Even with this slight annoyance, I would definitely buy this product agai

Soft leather, attractive look, and very easy to use.  Over-the-top strap easily secures blackberry in place.  Blackberry can easily be slid in and out of the holster.  I purchased this with my brand new blackberry (8703e) and have not observed a single scuff or scratch on the device after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holster.

The only potential negative is the plastic belt clip starts to dig into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time.

I would definately recommend this item

Although the i607 (BlackJack) was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectly. The earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button to answer a call. Even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly

I bought this for my Sanyo Katana phone, which is a bit thicker than the Razr. The fit is snug, but not too tight. My only problem is that due to the design, I sometimes accidentally push the buttons on the side of the Katana when I take it out of the case

This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  

As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow

Srudy phone during all scenarios. MP3 player is great, no compatibility problems. The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone. The camera is more than decent, (much like the 1.0-2.0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past) No problems what so ever, the design is rather smart and simple, without the lack of elegance. The flip-phone factor lets you talk comfortably, and safely with the antena safely away form your brain. The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches. Tiny design details that make it a Sony product. AMAZING battery life, surprising for an MP3 phone

This phone form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Micro(tm) (M2(tm)) NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone. It also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand.. almost a hollow feel. But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera. It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated. The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger. The way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception...so you just have to remember that when talking to someone. The inside screen is really really bright! I turned it all the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell. The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too, especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music

this is the 2nd SE phone after T637, and this phone is just better
using it with T-Mobile, it works pretty well as phone and modem
voice: the strongest part, the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years, the speakerphone is OK, not so loud
reception: another strongest part, with T-Mobile, it can get some weak signal when all other don't get signal at all; however, the antenna is located at the top back (where the loop is), touching this part will lose reception
operation: typical SE style, pretty easy for SE users, 3 dedicated buttons: web, messaging, task
cam: excellent, even though it doesn't have auto-focus like K750 and K790, it looks pretty good, even it's better than nokia 6270
bt: very easy to use and pair, with pc suite installed, file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake, the transfer speed is 300-400kB, this is the maximum of bt 2.0 speed
screen: the main screen is pretty bright, even I have to set the brightness down, animated standby screen is simply cool; external screen, however, is monochrome (it maybe a plus when using outdoors, the main is barely viewable under sunlight), it display info only, it's a kinda inconveient when doing self-pic
audio player: I seldom use it because it doesn't support ogg vorbis, which I mainly use, streaming audio supports real only, no shoutcast
conclusion: this phone is a pretty good phone for the price, quad-band is a must for Cingular users, fast EDGE modem for web and tethering
score: I give it 95/100, there're some cons
rare memory card (M2), and it's not hot-pluggable
lack of ogg vorbis and shoutcast support
no default USB mode (always asks when plug in, kinda annoying

When I ordered this item I already knew it didn't come with the driver/software cd but minutes after I ordered it DLN sent me an email telling me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me the link. That was nice of them... i'm kind of bummed that that charge feature doesn't work on my phone (D807) but that's just an issue with my phone I guess and nothing with the product.

I like this for more than one reason...so read on,

Reason #1 - It keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data, trust me this helps, when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone. 

Reason #2 - Only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred, so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car.

You will have to use windows media player to sync this phone (Samsung Sync SGH-A707) in order to transfer files. MP3 and WMV/WMA formats work with this phone, i do not know whether other formats work or not.

Let me explain in brief how to sync this phone with windows media player. Connect one end of the cable to your phone first and the USB end to your computer USB port (Preferably USB 2.0). If you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open My Computer on your computer. Now open Windows media player, you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu. From left to right you will be able to see in this order - Now Playing, Library, Rip, Burn, Sync, and Guide. Click on Sync. Make sure your Cell phone is connected, now you will see two halves in the same window, left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it goes (your cell phone name apears on the top), usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file, this takes a while. Also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card, as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory.

Once you are well versed with what your phone can play, i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB reader/writer as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer, this saves you a chunk of time and battery power.

I ordered this USB cable for my Samsung SYNC and it came fast. While there is no software provided I quickly found out it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could add music to my phone. After searching I found that Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for FREE! If you want to fully utilize your Sync's camera and MP3 capabilities I highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to Samsung's site for the free software

The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color

This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  

As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.

The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow

If you own a Q, you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible.  This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery, which is great. So I can charge my phone with the standard battery, and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot. Never having to worry about battery life again. Also, it makes a wonderful stand for the phone, and when hooked to the USB cable, you get data conectivity too.  Only downside, it won't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged.

Many people are having issues with the 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm adapters and Treos.  This adapter works FINE in my Treo 650. 

The plugs fit fine (I got the 2 pack) and I get STEREO sound through both headphones. 
If you do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will NOT get stereo sound. My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony (isolation) headphones work fine with this adapter. 

Maybe I'm just lucky, but for this low price, this adapter is fine. If you want sterling sound you shouldn't be listening to mp3 anyway. I can hear the limitations of my files on the treo, so it's clearly good enough

This is the kind of thing you don't care about unless it malfunctions.

I've had no problems at all with it. It seems sturdily built, and unlikely to break easily. The right-angle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device (A problem with straight plugs). It doesn't seem to have been made as cheaply as possible, but instead made well

I wondered if the "snap on" concept would feel and look secure.  It DOES.  It's rock solid and looks like it's part of the phone.  Additionally, the extra protection it provides to the little screen is wonderful.  I'd love to buy more colors when/if they become available

Holds the phone in an attractive, snug, leather case!  Clips to belt and holds tight.  Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical, I don't have trouble catching it on things.  I've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car.  The phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap.  This case works great and eliminates that problem!  The perfect solution

This case is made for an L6. The L2 uses the same case, so they both fit within this rubber case. However, the keys are laid out differently on the L6 - so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys. I didn't give it a low rating, because it's well built and is actually a really great product - just wanted to give  other L2 owners a warning. It works well, but it's just a little funky on an L2, but totally usable. For the price, you just can't beat it - and it's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket

After about a year, the ear support on this Bluetooth headset broke.  Bad news.  Good news: it has a 2 year warranty and Logitech is replacing it with a Mobile Traveller model since the Mobile Freedom is no longer made.  Contact Logitech Tech Support / Audio by phone (can't be done over the web).  It's nice to see a company stand behind their products.  Way to go, Logitech

Works great, its a bit bigger than some headsets, but in this case I feel thats a good thing, the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you don't get a feedback loop where the person you're talking to hears themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker.  The only complaint would be I wish the volume went up just a bit more, it can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly.  One note to anyone buying one...  the hole to plug the charger into is under the thing that holds it onto your ear, it rotates out of the way.  It took me awhile to find it when I first got it

To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either:
a. Feedback loop:  Where the other person hears themself speak
b. Ambient noise:  The other end hears everything around you, especially in a car

In minimizing these, the Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best.  I've tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without extraneous noises.

As for me, I hear everyone fine on all the headsets, but a conversation is a two-way street and if you've ever used a headset, I'm sure you're tired of hearing, "Take me off that stupid thing!"

The negatives with this headset are far outweighed by the call clarity.  Yes, it's big and ugly, but your friends will thank you.

The other negative to be aware of (although I assume this is more due to the age of my headset as it's only recently started doing this) is that I've found is that after 1 year, while the battery still holds a charge well, it sometimes drops the link to the phone when I hang up after a call and I can't get it back until I recharge the thing.  Like I said, it's getting a bit old though.

Overall, if I was going to buy a new one, I'd get this one.

As far as the other 3 tested, I'll rank them in order of call quality (best to worst).
Plantronics Discovery 655 (not too bad, but hard to keep in your ear)
Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX (more for wireless stereo headphones than for calling)
Motorola HS850 (Looks cool, but a total piece of garbage)

p.s.  If you're wondering why I have 4 headsets it's because there's nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone.  1 for the car, 1 for the home, 1 for the... well you get the picture.

I've had several gens of the candybar blackberries, 7100 nice but reception/mike was horrendous, 7130 much better, finally nailed it. Was dubious when I had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky.... but I'll give it the full thumbs up now. Slightly smaller than 7130, which oddly does make a difference, like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something. Makes my partner's Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison. Unobtrustive in yr pocket. The "pearl" trackball is just fine, like it better than roller actually. Reception, mike quality are also good, despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130. Writing is good too, the suretype continuing to be so durn accurate I sometimes forget to check. And hey, I like having the camera. So, I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone, the one that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great.... but actually... I like the Pearl better. If you need bulletproof email, PDA, and phone, this is yr baby. Slightly shorter battery life, but hasn't stranded me yet.

My first blackberry and I love it! I wanted to stop lugging around a phone AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts, calendar and task-to-do list. I wanted a phone that synched with Outlook and was a great phone.  The Pearl is definitely the BEST choice.  I didn't really care about internet, music or camera, but the cheapest $30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly - it's just great!  I bought the $40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it.  I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and it's GREAT to be able to instantly recognize who's calling from the music.  Camera is ok - not great, but ok and very nice to have for on-the-spot photos that you don't want to lug around the regular digital for.  I actually emailed a picture on the spot - very cool.  Battery life is phenomenal so far.  However, I'm not a heavy user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day. 

Only cons so far are: 1) getting used to the keypad - believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word.  I've followed other folks' advice and don't really look at the words letter by letter - i type a sentence and then look - it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word.  Still, this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user, but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim.
2) Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone - I have to reseat the battery to get the change to take effect.  Hmmm...
3) Volume when talking, even on speakerphone, is average - not terrible, but ok.  So far, my reception is fine.
4) I also wonder how long the track ball will last - I'm not a heavy user and I still use it constantly.  I think i'm going to buy the insurance plan just in case.

These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more.  Bye Bye Dell Axim.  It's true what some say - I'm a "crackberry" because playing with this thing is addictive. I'll update this review again in 3 months or so, but I don't anticipate any problems.  My only regret is I didn't hold out until a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosk.  I would honestly give this phone 4.5 out 5 stars if they let you

Top line: This is the best BlackBerry I've ever used, and among the best phones I've ever used.  I can use it at work and after hours with out compromise in functionality and style/size.

I've been (some what grudgingly) using Blackberry since the first "pager-style" 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthrough for me.  Finally, I have a corporate device that treats me like a consumer!
The good:
- Great voice dial: particularly if you are a commuter with a headset.  No need to record your voice for each address entry- just say who you want to call and it it doesn't understand you it will prompt you for more info.
- Size and appearance: Finally I don't look like a dork talking to something the size of my palm.  The phone is as small as many phone-only candy bars.
- Easy private email set-up (as with all modern BlackBerries).  Seems to have some sort of auto set-up for Mac mail and Gmail, others too I imagine
- Macintosh compatibility: I just bought "The Missing Sync" for Apple Mac OS X ($40 USD) to synchronize my address book, calendar, tasks and notes from my MacBook Pro.  Works great! The software provided by RIM is not very easy to use.
- Fantastic screen and innovative "Outlook Today" style summery screen for missed calls, latest emails etc.  Look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with the phone.
- As others have mentioned, the keyboard is very good.  Coming from a full size BB keyboard, I thought I might miss it, but the 8100's is a breeze to use.

The not as good:
- Speaker phone is functional and sound quality in general is fine.  Nothing like my Sony Ericsson though...
- I think I have a minor voice quality issue between the phone and my Motorola H700 headset (the best headset I've ever owned).  I think that it might be a compatibility issue. 
- More Mac compatibility would be appreciated - like native iSync and bluetooth support

This is my first BlackBerry device. In fact, this is the first cell phone I've had where I had a data plan setup. I gotta say I'm luving it! My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop. The browser is very robust and seems to work great. I've installed a few extra applications (google maps, bbweather, and Yahoo go to name a few) and I haven't had any problems. The applications cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful. I still have yet to try the Opera browser for the BB. The camera is so clear with and without the flash it's scary. It beats my old cameraphone hands down!

I've discovered that the moniker "CrackBerry" is so true. I'm just hooked on getting emails, surfing the web and listening to some tunes, all from the same device at the same time. I've discovered a whole community of simmilar BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of this device.

The pearl's suretype keyboard learns as I go and words it didn't get right at first it now picks up and selects as I type. I don't even need to censor the typing too often anymore. I stuck with the suretype mode and caught on to it right quick. This may be because I've never used any other type of mobile device keyboard prior to the pearl. The learning curve was but a shallow hill. 

My only complaints are that the mp3 player will not play through a wireless headset. You can trick it into doing so, but normal play is only through the speaker on the device or through the wired headset. Also the speakerphone is a bit muffled as the battery cover actually covers up the speaker! Now there are after mod kits that have an oem battery cover with a hole for the speakerphone, but come on. Finally the vibration of the phone is kind of weak. Not a big complaint but it bears mentioning.

Overall this device is great for beginners like myself. I cannot recommend it enough

I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device. Its stylish, beautiful, small, and it has some awsome features. However, since i bought it from Amazon, Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number. So I constantly had to call amazon and ask them about my order. Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didn't want to work. So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card... when it wasn't. Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL. Overall, Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy. But whatever I love shopping @ Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too. :)!!

I've had this phone for about a week now and I'm glad I waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive. Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windows-based devices, there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions. Also, I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type. Boy was I wrong about that one. OK, so for the review.

My motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first, with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the device. The Pearl fits that bill perfectly. Phone quality is excellent. Loading ringtones (a pain at first) proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research. Ringtones play very loud and clear. The music player is MUCH better than first impressions would lead you to believe. After a few hours of frustration, I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app. Again, did some research, visited a few forums, and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize. As an owner of a NANO, I was disappointed with the interface of the player. But once you go into the menu functions, you'll find much more functionality. It's not an ipod, but it works as an decent replacement. And if you're not an ipod owner, you'll likely have no complaints. Sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones. Camera is only so-so, but I don't really care about that anyway. Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera. The couple of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy. Part of why I dropped my rating from 5 stars. As far as email, I have a BB from work and they won't let me use a non-work issued device to access the network, so I have no opinion on email functionality. Organizer features (calendar, tasks, notes, etc) seem more than adequate. Much better than any of my old Pocket PC devices.

The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I haven't been able to figure out and while I'm admittingly not a techie, these should be pretty basic and intuitive. One, I would like to set one of my ringtones as the default ringer. That should be fairly simplistic but I can't figure it out. Two, I would like to change the order of the icons on some of the themes. Again, should be pretty basic, but no go. Almost forgot, can't listen to music through bluetooth. Not sure why, but this is really my only MAJOR complaint.

Only minor complaints. All in all, a pretty sweet device. And BTW, form factor and looks are simply the best out there. I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack, very happy that I went with the Pearl.

UPDATE - Figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons. Coming from a Windows mobile environment, I was expecting something along the lines of: Start-programs-etc-etc. Everyting in windows takes so many keystroks. With the Pearl, it was so easy. I was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience. I'm going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo. Otherwise, as close to a perfect device as I've used (and I've used quite a few)

I had a palm 650 for two years. It had a few issues, but generaly speaking it worked well. Unfortunately one of my big concerns was the phone size.  When I first Bought it, I did not think it woud be a big deal. But after having it for a while, it felt like I was carring a brick in my packet (If you are an smart phone user, then you know what I am talking about.) I wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size. I was debating between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearl. At first I thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palm, Q, or bjack; but I had it for 3 months now and to tell the truth,there is so many advantages on this phone I do not miss my palm at all. The pearl not only does not have the flaws that palm does, but also has the same (or more) capabilities and browsing speed. The trackball works way better than a touchscreen. So far I am very happy with my purchase that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack. The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring a phone and not a brick in my packet. Not sure about it? then do not believe me; simply check the reviews of all smarth phones online. You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other smart phones

This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  

As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow

This phone is great! I got it for Christmas and it works like a charm! The loud speaker is excellent and the ringtones are cool. Some of the wallpapers are a bit weird but they have nice ones too. The ringtones are loud and you can easily hear it ringing. the LCD screen is big and the menus are easy to navigate. The buttons are a comfortable size and I love this phone. So far I haven't found any flaws at all and the phone has great battery life. I had to  keep it on for a few hours and the bars stayed the same! I highly reccomend this phone to any who like it. The phone is light weight and small and it doesn't get in the way! I love this phone and have encouraged someone to get one already. Even though it doesn't have a camera, I'd say that it is still great! As for the cons....I cannot think of any and anyone who says that you cannot hear it ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong company. Virgin Mobile is great but not designed for those people who are on their phones all day. It's not the phone's fault.

I bought this little phone 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it.  I don't use it every day, or even every week.  I got it to keep with me when I'm driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now.  It has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars.  What I like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can be easily tucked inside pockets or small bags.  It charges fully in a very short time, under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that.  It holds that charge for a very long time as I just found out recently. Driving to an appointment I was running late and needed to call to let them know.  I'd forgotten to recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail.  To my delight it turned right on and I made the call with no problems.  Can't beat that.  The Virgin prepay plan is perfect for users like me and ends up costing about $6 a month.  Tell me there's something better and I'll say prove it.  I looked long and hard to find the best possibility and this was it.  I think it still is.  For a nice, dependable "insurance" type phone, I couldn't be more pleased and genuinely recommend it.

This phone is great!  It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the  low ringtone problem by searching for "audiovox 8610 hack" over the internet.

You can purchase a cable on ebay and d/l some free softwares over the net. Then you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free.  Of course you have to be computer-savey to do so.  So don't do it unless you know what you're doing.


The phone allows 20 seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone.  The cool thing is that each ringtone can be attached to a phone number in the phonebook so you know who's calling by the ring.

I downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from the net and mix 'n match them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones.  

example:  3 stooges sound +  bell ring + whistle +  homer "doh" + wolf howl - all in one 20 second ringtone.

I also made some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well.  

I noticed some songs and sound-effects are louder than others.  Thus I only keep the loudest  ringtone and they're very loud!  I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the ring in my pocket and backpack.

Overall, this phone is always on sale at places like Target. If you can make your own ringtone and download it into the phone, you can have all the free custom ringtones you could ever dream of

I have to admit, if you want more from prepaid, Virgin Mobile is a rip off. But if you're only going to use your phone once in a while, then it's alright. I bought my Audiovox about a year or two ago and it was a good investment. Sleek phone, outer dsiplay, the calls were good quality and I never would get dropped calls. Furthermore, the color display is great and the battery life is amazing. 

The phone has all the basic features, looks great, and is practical for anyone who's not looking for anything outrageous like cameras or Mp3. I have also say that despite the service Vmobile has good phones.

But now that I'm needing my phone more and more I'm ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the whole 25 cents a minute and 10 cents after that is too expensive. I have to agree with the other reviews. And for their new "promotions" those hardly last and are only for new customers..so much for customer service. The ringtones are a little pricey, but still reasonable; test messaging is available at 10 cents, good price. 

If you want to get more features, minutes, whatever, I say look into other prepaid offers like net10, tracphone or T-mobile. You get more prepaid with t-mobile but the phones with good stuff will cost you a bit more

hey...im also 14 yrs old and i've owned this phone for about 2 months....i absolutely luv this fone...i originally wanted the tmobile sidekick. but i couldn't switch my carrier and it was waayyy expensive...so i looked for a fone that is great for texting and i wouldnt have to pay alot for texting...and i found this one !!!!...the only thing is it doesn't have an mp3 player nor a camcorder...also, it is a bit bulky and it doesn't have as much features as the enV...but i have it for what i wanted it for....TEXTING...this fone has instant messaging and multimedia messaging..virgin mobiles service is good, but i have to be honest i do not use this fone to talk, but only to text...so i can't tell u how the talking service is...my parents totally luv virgin mobile for teens...u don't have to be a teenager to have this fone, but this fone is ideal for a "text-crazed teenager"..BUY THIS FONE !!!

*** i jus found out that kyocera has a new upcoming fone...its lyke the 2nd version to the switchback...its called the kyocera m1000...so look it up and see wat its about...it looks just lyke the "enV

I bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago, so I got a good deal on it. Well, as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard. Other than that I have had no problems, call reception is great. The camera on this phone isn't the greatest but I don't need it to be high end for the basic fun pics I take. If you're looking to get zoom in, larger, clearer pictures this isn't the phone for you. The camera screens can be a bit confusing but I've learned to deal with it & my pics come out as I like. A strange feature is the speakerphone, while it is quite loud & clear, Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound. Aside from these things, I love my switchback. The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small. 
As far as plans are concerned I don't have any problems w/ over charges since I have the 18 cents/min plan. It's good to know that the monthly plans aren't recommended though. A bonus to the per minute plans is the Sugar Mama service, where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips. Good for purchasing games or ringtones w/o using up your top-up money.
And this cell isn't only for the young crowd, I'm an over 25 mom. I got this phone b/c other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones & those that do require addt'l internet service plans (like Blackberry's, Black Jack & Palm TREO's). I only wanted to easily send txts & have it in one compact phone. This was ideal for me

Ok. I can say I have been a realtor, a nurse,an HR person, a mom. That means a heavy phone user- since 1990. My first phone was the old motorola brick analog. One of the greatest and biggest phones ever. I remember my first digital phone, and first pnone with games. I have had a total of 5 phones, motorola, nokia, ericson, panasonic. This kyocera is the best. I don't want a treo palm because I already travel with a lap top. What I want is a text phone that is small and easy to use. This querty key board rocks. The menu is just like a computer and easy to make selections. The more features you need on the phone, the more you want a qwerty key board. Get this phone and be happy. Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it. Very sturdy little phone, and the antena is the loop so it won't poke you. Comes with  a very easy to read guide book so start up is easy. I paid $199 for this phone in my region and it is worth every penny

I have a Motorola V220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month.  The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally, which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet.  It's fairly light weight and made of plastic, but seems durable enough.  A small red LED lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet, regardless of whether you're charging your phone or not.  I debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price

I purchase this phone for both my wife and I, and we both love them. Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time to learn to navigate, but is very versatile and functional. Reception and call quality are great, and pairing with a bluetooth headset was quick and painless. The screen is bright and crisp. There is no 3g in my area, but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing. Media player works well. Battery life is good with 3g turned off. This phone comes with both a standard and extended battery. With pretty heavy usage, I still have 1/2 battery power at night. 3g is said to really suck the power, though. Lots and lots of 3rd party software available to make this phone do pretty much whatever you want

I've been using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it. Sure there are things I would change, but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes. 

Cons: 

* The keyboard buttons are really small, but then I'm not sure how you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger. And I wouldn't want the phone to get any bigger. 

* If you ever see an ad that has a number like this - "1-800-Big-Deal" good luck on figuring out the alpha-to-numeric translation. Haha. I had that issue not long ago. However, I think all smartphones have that issue.

* Lacks voice dialing via bluetooth headset. This one is big for me. I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr and really miss this feature.

Pros:

The list would be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone. So here are a few:

* Browser support is awesome! I can view everything, even Flash apps!
* VPN support. If you are corporate, 'nuff said. This rocks.
* Easy bluetooth setup and management.
* Perfect size for a Smartphone. Not too wide and very thin.
* Glass screen (doesn't scratch) and screen resolution is unbelievable.
* Quick toggle scroll button on side is a life saver.
* Extended life battery comes with the phone. 
* Easy side access to SD card. No having to slide the battery off to remove or replace.

There are a ton of great things about this phone. I hear the iPhone is supposed to be the real deal, but until I see for myself, I'm sticking with this beauty. Buy one. You won't be sorry. I got mine for $75 with a $75 rebate. Free? Can't go wrong which ever way you look at it. :)

This phone is a great corporate phone.  It is the best windows mobile phone currently available, in my oppinion. 

They overlooked a few features:  
-There is no LCD light to tell you its charging status - instead the screen has to be on all the time.  
-There is no way to know when the num lock key is on - so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up.
-In order to unlock the phone, you have to press the on/off button at the top of the phone, which is not in a very convenient location.
-The track wheel feels pretty cheep

this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality.  Syncs to Windows PC and MS Office with ease.  Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery.  Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer.  Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome.  Nice to see this feature return.  When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature, then it was optional, then it was gone.  Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player.  Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating.  Many videos will convert and then not display.  Music is no problem.  Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play.  Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.  Since this is a MS Smartphone, there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone.  Be aware of the aspect ratio, this is a landscape display and not portrait.  If you get games or applications for it be  sure of the aspect ratio.  This is a 240H by 320W display.  Size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness. 

The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing.

Niggles:
1. Camera is slow and not very clear, but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either.
2. need more ring tones. The ones that come with this phone are lame at best.  Download or create some of your own.
3. Need more menu choices.  The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to get around.
4. Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe I should not list this complaint)

I used the Seidio rubberized case before this. It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pocket. This case is about 1/2 inch wider and thicker, but it protects the phone on all sides except the top. The phone slips in and out effortlessly. It looks great, and the magnet puts it to sleep, which is nice. Even though it is a bit more bulky I can't go back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks. I just use a screen protector, but many use Best Skins Ever with it no problem. It's also pretty cheap ($15). Less than the Seidio and other pouches out there.

Works just fine! Delivery was earlier than predicted. I am well satisfied. I looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a simple thing but they didn't have them. I was told "they can order one". I thought to myself.......so what, so can I. This was much easier. I ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right to my door----no muss, no fuss. This is the way to buy such items! Thanks for a great job

The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color

This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  

As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the "thickness" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.

The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick

I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.

Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow

Compared to the "face out" belt clip I had previously, this "face in" version has proved to be a bit more stable and sturdy so far.  Hopefully, it will remain so.  For the price, it's not too hard to appreciate.

You can't beat this price. This holder works great. You must remove your phone before answering it. Make sure you put the phone in with the camera facing the clip. I put it in backwards at first. The phone won't stay in that way

This is a great cover to the Sansa MP3 player.  It is heavy duty rubber that is thin where it can be and thicker in all the necessary places.  It has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the Sansa screen from scratching or shattering.  You'd be silly not to purchase this $20 case to protect your $150+ investment.

The one downside I can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allow the player to sit in most cradles, docks, or speakers.  It is not difficult to put the case on, but it would be frustrating to take it on and off often.  Just something to consider if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often.  The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the toughskin on

I gave this four stars because the `jacket' adds significant bulk and weight to the Sansa product. What was once a slim, sleek product is now a rather large, rubberized item. On the plus side, this jacket definitely protects the MP3; it is very solid, and covers the item completely and securely. They included a belt clip, and a screen cover that is very hard and will not be easily scratched. The buttons around the wheel are far easier to press now. I wish there were other color choices, but over all I'm very pleased with the product. Before it was covered I was reluctant to put in my purse or pocket for fear of breakage and scratches to the screen, but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go. Highly recommended product

The Sansa e200 is good for all of the things it will do considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the Ipod Nano.  Unlike, the Nano it will play video and comes with its own video conversion software.  Further, unlike the Nano, the Sansa has a built in FM tuner and FM recorder which can be nice.  Finally, the sansa has a voice recorder which I do not have a personal use for but just goes to show how feature rich this mp3 player is.

On the negative side:

The Sansa, which will accept upto a 2gig MicroSD memory card, but turns on slowly when a memory card is placed in the expansion slot.

I like to listen to audio books and the Sansa does not have the ability to bookmark.  This makes listening to audio books very difficult.

Overall, the Sansa is a very feature rich player with a great battery life   with only a few shortcomings

I bought this case for use at work. I work in a semi-dusty shop environment. I'm always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well. I don't have to worry about the screen getting scratched (The screen on the Sansa e2oo series scratches very easily) with the hard plastic screen protector. I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and co-workers.

I really like this protective cover.  It is very well made, and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall.  The funny thing is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it.  Before I bought the ToughSkin, the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped.  Now that it is in the case, it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure.  It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it.  The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well.  The only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect.  Overall, this is an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend

This cover is the best you can get for your Sansa E series player. It increases the size a little but the durability is worth it. The belt clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too. I purchased an armband but this is much better.  It also comes with a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary item, my display began to show minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use, so if you don't buy this, at least get the little expensive stick on covers. The toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier. The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the micro-sd slot without removing the Sansa, but that is only a small issue. My advice, you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 player so spend a little more and protect it the best you can

I'm a previous owner of Body Glove Cel Phone cases (a Moto V810).

I purchased this item from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255.  My Cel fits perfectly. The case protects every part of my Cel (buttons, screens, jacks) and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case, and looks nice.

My next phone will have its body glove case too

This case was a perfect fit for my Mot V180 phone. The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately, then snap together so they stay in place on the phone so it can't easily fall out (a problem that I'd had with a different product). The part that slips over the top of the phone has a built-in see-through window that lines up just right, so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case.

The quality of construction looks to be pretty good, too

I was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone. I wanted a holster that wasn't a sloppy generic model that didn't fit. I was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and I tried it on my Motorola V180. It fits like a glove and looks good. No complaints here. So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you, that you won't be disappointed. The added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer:

This is a great case! I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didn't line up.  Because this is a flip phone, most cases move when you open and shut the phone, covering speakers, etc.  This case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement, when you open and close the phone, doesn't affect the placement of the holes, etc. in the case.  Also, the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent.

This is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free Motorola V180 - Spend the money on this case to protect your phone!  I looked at many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly - really PROTECTIVE.  The V180 apparently has had a few comments on the home screen going ka-plooky - 'nuf said - I needed a better grade, clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad.  Sydney Harbour gets high marks on this feature - not flimsy dull plastic but very clear, quality stuff.  Secondly, the super-soft, matte black leather is a sweet fit - nice and snug, form-fitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching.  The cut outs are perfectly lined up too - there IS one for the speaker phone feature on the back (not mentioned in the ads).  Snap on the antenna loop and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel.  Sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product - but if you're like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life, you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases. Be nice to yourself and your phone - Go with Sydney Harbour and avoid the cheaper stuff

This device works great.  I use it on a USB Laptop to charge the Treo 650. I also use it on a wall outlet and the car.  No problems.  The cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient.  It does not come with a case, so you'll use your own bag or whatever.  The part that fits into the Treo is very secure.  It does not pop off like other chargers.  The only thing I can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged

Belt clip is sturdy.  Velcro is velcro (it's solid, but the separation noise can be annoying when you're trying to get to your phone in a quiet setting).  Love the flexability of the side connectors, allowing quick access to the phone.  Comfortable and fairly low profile.

Though it makes the phone a little more bulky than you might be used to at first, it quickly becomes a non-factor and though it doesn't provide quite as much extra life as I had hoped it would, it does in fact make the difference between my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry. A solid purchase

I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake.  Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potential to last a long time, something that prior holsters have failed to do. I also like the magnetic closure, which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case, without the need for finding a snap fitting.  My older Blackberries have had cases which, after use, had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the "two-handed" method for nesting my phone, one hand to move the flap out of the way, and the other to insert the phone into the case.  This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the more-preferred "one-handed" approach. Although still relatively new, my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction. 

Before I purchased my Leather Swivel case, I looked at 3rd party generic cases.  Each of these were unable to "notify" my Blackberry that it was in its holster.  With my new swivel case, as soon as I insert my Pearl, the display shuts off thereby extending battery life.  In addition, this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or not.  Also, since this is an OEM case, it was made especially for my Pearl.  When holsetered, both the USB connector,the earphone outlets and the volume control buttons are all accessible. With non-OEM cases, in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone, I might have to remove the phone from its case. 

I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no case at all.  This is probably due to its small size and your ability to just slip the phone into your shirt pocket, unlike prior Blackberry devices.  Of course, that still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratch-potential.  They should have at least provided a simple pouch, which would provide some protection.  This of course is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel case, which is the subject of THIS review.  All-in-all, I highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on your belt ... and since I'm at it, I LOVE MY PEARL

I got this for my moto e815.  You need to hunt down all the drivers and software for it on your own if you want it to work well with the e815... The quality of the cable...well... it disconnects every couple minutes or so... but that was long enough for me to do a seem edit and so now I'll use bluetooth-obex to sync and transfer... which is all I needed it for.  The charger also connected/disconnected constantly...making my phone beep every 10 seconds as it started to charge/not charge repeatedly.  If you plan to use it for this purpose I recommend hunting down Moto phone tools 3.25b, e815 modded PST 7.11, SDmodified p2k seem, and the e815 usb drivers (usbmot2000.inf, and cdm1x.inf) Good luc

This battery has much better life than the battery that come with the Q.
I would say you can do twice as much talking, surfing, texting, etc. while charging it about as often.
There are higher Mah batteries available for the Q, but they cost $49-$59, so for $13 or so this is a pretty good deal.

The only downside (and maybe I just didn't read description well enough) is that the battery door is silver, which looks dorky on my black Q

I really like this case!  It is easy to put on and take off.  It does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen.  It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold.  I would like for more colors.  I would really like for something to glow in the dark, so that I could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse.

I have tried 4-5 of theses phones over the last 4 years.  This one works the best of all I have tried.  The latest was the Cingular 8525 (HTC makes it) and it dropped 80% of incoming calls on pickup and 20% of outgoing calls. I thinks Windows was loading a DLL - (;&lt;))) The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based SPs

I've had a Treo 650 for a long time.  I wasn't 100% sure I'd want the 680, when it was first announced, but a big nasty scratch on my 650's screen helped me decide to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.  The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better, the internal slot for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might get lost, and the covered SD card slot is very welcome, because the darned thing always popped out in my 650.  The only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button.  To reset the 680, you have to take out the battery.  That's not a big deal, since even on the 650, you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch.  What's better on the 650?  The main thing for me is that the cell phone's radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards (SDHC).  I use this phone for everything, since it's also a great Palm organizer.  In addition to that, I've installed a registered version of Pocket Tunes, so it's a very good MP3 player.  It's even compatible with PlaysForSure, if you're into that.  That's why I'm so happy to see the 8gb support.  I also use the phone to play games, like Monopoly and Scrabble, when I'm waiting on line or in a boring meeting.  I have absolutely zero complaints about this phone.

Believe it or not, i consider going from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrade. i guess the whole battery problem depends on the usage and the person. My battery problem is that i cant kill the darn thing! 
I am one of those people that depletes a battery completely before recharging it. I do it to my laptop and my iPod and the PDA i had before the BlackJack, the Tungsten 2E. Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks. Mainly because you CAN NOT create and edit word, excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook. Which i absolutley can not put up with. Even the contacts wouldn't backup! Needless to say, the Treo 680 saved me. If you do go the way of the blackjack without Outlook, look into SBSH's programs Facade and Papyrus. However, if you go with the lovely Treo check out "DialByPhoto" i think the coolest part is how you can set up a "Favorite 5" like TMobile offers but still have all the reliability of Cingular

I just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it.  It is my favorite phone i have had to date.  Some people ask me "What can that thing do"? and i respond to that what cant it do.  This phone can do anything you really want.  The features are nicely made to be used.  Especially since it has a beautiful 2.2 in touchscreen.  The display is incredible.  I can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do.  The last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance

The Pros: PDA, good mobile phone that really gets out, a camera for all those 'Kodak Moments', all packed in one for a good price
The Cons: You'll need to get a replacement longer life battery (Seidio makes one), and the browser (Blazer) has MANY problems.

I'm very happy with the purchase of this smartphone. I've wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one. You can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software, it's a nice little phone.

I haven't bought a memory card for it, so I can't report on the mp3 capabilities, but I am going in that direction. Somehow I don't think it will replace my iPod, but you never know

I've had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications, I especially love having the Goodlink email application, my family videos, mp3's, pics, and all my office documents at a touch of a finger. Yes the battery life goes quickly but I don't mind charging my treo every night.

The slick and slim design is a real eye catcher and feel great in the hand.[...]

in the one month of usage, my Treo has hung, one time, a simple reset fixed it and hasn't hung since

I bought this even though I saw a lot of negative reviews, some about battery life, some about dropped signals. So far I have had neither.

I have owned many Palm devices over the years and I will be the first one to say that Palm can make lemons, and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later, if they ever do. Not the most customer-oriented, quality-oriented company out there. But their OS is still the easiest to use in my mind, and with the myriad of apps out there you can make it do whatever you want, pretty much. 

The screen is on the smallish side compared to the TX, but it's not that bad, especially for a phone. It's pretty reliable, and I have put a lot of my old software on it. The battery is what surprised me the most; I was expecting something really bad, but so far I have never been under 50%, and I am a heavy Palm user. I don't use the phone part of it much, just a call here and there, and I turn the phone function off at night. I also bought KBLightsOff, which turns off the keyboard lights unless you are using it, which probably helps a lot. So with these two settings, battery life is close to the TX in my opinion.

I have one dead pixel, but that can happen to any electronics manufacturer. I don't like the 2.5mm jack at the bottom of the device, that's a terrible place to put it. But with an adapter I can use my good headphones and sound is good. Get pTunes Deluxe so you can use subsription music like Napster or Yahoo Music. I should receive my 8GB SDHC card tomorrow, which will turn my Treo into an iPhone killer, IMHO. And for way less than $599...

Sound level is OK, and you can get software that boosts it up if you're deaf. Speaker level is LOUD! The SMS program is great, the phone app is great and fast.

So, overall, it's a great device. I wish Palm wouldn't charge an arm and a leg for accessories, but you don't have to buy from them..

Bought this to replace my three-year-old cell phone and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc.  My observations after 30 days of ownership:

1.  Setup is time consuming but unavoidable.  Patience is required.  I've had a couple of questions that I asked Cingular, only to be forwarded to Palm, only to be forwarded to Microsoft, then back to Cingular.  It seems no Customer Service department has really mastered this unit.

2.  Have to do a soft reset every once in a while.  The unit turns off the sound by itself and the only way I've found to fix it is to do a soft reset.

3.  I'm not crazy about Microsoft Outlook's calendar compared to Palm's.  I miss several Palm features, like the "Go to" and the "Today" buttons.  Outlook's calendar just isn't as easy to manuever as Palm's.

4.  Phone listening volume is low, especially when the unit is in a protective case, which puts it a little further from your ear.

5.  Love the Bluetooth option.  It's new to me and it's just great.

6.  Love being able to press a picture to make a call.  We have five kids; I have each kid's picture linked to their phone number.  Even my technology-challenged husband can call them by simply pressing their picture.  

7.  This phone talks!  A female voice announces who is calling and when your next appointment is.  The first time she spoke it about scared me to death.  The voice reminds me of the computer on Star Trek--but not as clear.  However, after getting used to her accent, she is intelligible, which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken words--amazing!

8.  The Internet connection has limited use for me.  I don't need email on the run and I could live without this and the extra monthly cost.  Most traditional Internet web sites take much too long to load and display too small a portion of the page to be useful.  It is nice to check the weather or get directions on the go.  

9.  Can't imagine watching a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen.  What's the point?

10.  Splurged on a sweet little Vaja leather case that is wonderful.  Very expensive, but a terrific luxury.

11.  Amazon's prices were the best BY FAR on this product! Saved over $300 off my local retail Cingular dealer. 

12.  Best part:  I no longer have to carry a PDA and a cell phone!  They are one and the same!  

13.  Conclusion: this phone is very smart and fun to use, although it comes with a big learning curve.  The low volume issue could be a problem for someone with bad hearing

The whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with Cingular Wireless Customer Service to port over my number from Verizon.  The Treo 750 was a snap to figure out, setting up my email took only a few minutes.  I've owned it for three weeks now and I am still discovering great phone/PDA features.  I bought a 4gb mini SD card (samsung memory) from ebay for $39.99.  Combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs.  I also bought a Shure tEC3 earbuds for $110.  They're about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2.5mm jack.

Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750, but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it won't arrive for about a month and a half!  I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately.  Sad...

Treo 750, one of the best and coolest phone. I am in love with this phone. Because of Windows OS, it is very easy to use and understand functions. Slim and light weight. Love the touch screen function.

I ordered this phone on Sunday evening and got it on Wednesday, Amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones. 

Also I ordered two phones (Family plan), there was some problem in other phone, I requested the replacement and Amazon FIRST sent me the replacement of that phone through FREE 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone. I am so impressed with Amazon's service

I work for an University and my contract was due 2 months ago.  I decided to get this phone because my PDA was already old and I needed something that would be efficient.  I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good things to say about it.  First, it is not as heavy as the last model (650) and also looks really cool.  Second, the interface is pretty easy to use and figure it out.  The phone is Microsoft OS based (I used a palm device before) so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue.  The battery works really well and, in spite of other reviews, the life have been pretty great, even when compared with my last phone (a motorola).

In general, I thinks is a pretty good buy and you cannot beat the price when Cingular sells it for way more money than Amazon.  I'll definetively will buy from this website again

I bought my Treo 750v a couple of days ago. I got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported, like short time lived batery.
The only problem I am facing is with setting my voice mail.
The icon shown in the today page does not accept any number I will to attach to it. As a result, I was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number.
I really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by Palm with a downloadable file because, except for this problem, Treo 750 is really great

my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones i've ever heard. i don't know what it's called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it. the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time, including him. it's great for a business that has many locations. i only give this product four stars because i haven't tried it myself so i don't know all the features. but i hope the review i've provided helps

I came over from Cingular after trying there PTT, just not happening for me,  and I will leave it at that.

I choose this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall, ( Love Blue ) I bought this for 110.00 at a corporate store, I get a discount for the company I work for. We had a problem with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the box phone.  The clarity and ease of functionality is Fantastic, you dont have to be a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the GPS along with Telenav is fantastic, we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower I can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkie's,  hey if your going to spend the money do it right the first time.   I put the extended battery on mine and I get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge, which too me is great.  Dont change the default times for backlighting, thats whats eating the battery time up,  also dont leave a java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also.
Buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds, Moto has a phonebook manager package on there site which is FREE and is SO easy to use.   For Ringtones and wallpapers u can use WebJal, once again EASY to use.   I looked at other phones and I DONT NEED CAMERAS in a phone, the primary selling feature was the fact of large numbers and ease of use.

My husband and I just recently upgraded to this phone.We were going to got to the i560 but got a great deal on these. So far so good. I switched from an i730. What a difference! It seems lighter. It fits in my pocket better. the other always came unclipped when I stood up, falling to the ground. I like the sound quality better also. The screen is a little bigger than the i730 also. The front screen for caller ID seems a little dark and the area to charge it is a little harder to get to(that plastic still gets in the way!) Those are the only negatives so far. I really like the buttons on the i760. Since my husband is switching from an old i90 he loves it! Hope this helps with purchasing. Also if you have no service you can use these as walkie talkies. We haven't tried that yet

I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving, so I decided to upgrade my phones.  (the first 730's speaker grill came off, and i tried to glue it back on myself.  A word to the wise, don't use too much glue.)  So, I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet.  I didn't need a camera phone, since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures.  One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April, I couldn't sign back up for two years and get the $150.  I could only sign up for a year, and I had to pay $275.  I don't understand that.  
But this review is about the phone:
Cons: 
super short battery life, especially if you have the web.
instead of having a separate button for each number key, it has three big keys, with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys. unfortunately, you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center, otherwise you'll dial the number above or beneath it.  
the jury is still out on this one, but i'll list it under cons.  the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic, whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal.

pros:
huge display
a whole lot lighter than the 730
i enjoy the photo caller id.  it also shows the photo when you call that person
the sleep mode is a good addition.  if you don't use the phone for a couple of minutes, the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up.

The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front, especially since there were several colors.  This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blue.  OH well.  I'll write more the more i explore the phone.

I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo -- it's well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable.  The material is soft to the touch but strong on protection.  I don't like the lanyard they send with the product, it's about 24" long and reminds me of shoelaces.  I prefer a smaller, more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist

I tripped and basically THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk.  With the skin on it, no harm done.  None.  This is the second skin I've owned - the first from JAVOSkin - and I like this one better than the first.  The skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use.  I didn't like the cord attaching bump on the side at first - but I did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag.  I highly recommend this product - whether or not you use the cord

This item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesn't easily clip into the phone, you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it

This is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt. My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks. I would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls
