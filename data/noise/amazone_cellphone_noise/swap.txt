When I tried to switch gel covers it comes with 3 different sizes the entire came earpiece off in my hands
The ear gels are comfortable at first but an after hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it
The sound quality is TERRIBLE People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my v300 Motorola
What is worse I people am talking to hear me very poorly
They say there so is much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar even when Im just sitting in my car
People can barely hear over me the background noise racket
Beware The Product Features for this specified product
selected I this model because of the advertised feature
I returned the item and charged was for the return shipping
I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not of part the product
In the online return process theres no option that states the return was a of result Amazon
Basically they falsely advertise so that you buy the product and when you discover its not the right youre one screwed
now I understand all those complaints Ive read about Amazon
Ill take the loss this time but I wont my repeat mistake and order from them again
This review is not so much about the product as it is Amazon about
I couldnt use the so product sorry I couldnt give a review about it
I purchased this item for use while my driving car in Oct of 2005 for 29
I was told it would work for the LG which phones is what I have
I see now you can no longer find these for sale and I gee wonder why
I probable this used item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic
and after only 8 uses a friend of mine bought also one and his lasted about 6 months as well
While using it the phone cuts out and the can caller not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work
com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with emails the
I have a feeling I anyways lose with this purchase
The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due the to fit but al least it was free and still works top notch
bad To this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived
Mine lasted for only three weeks one then day stopped working
I went through 2 of these in as many months sound the quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working
People regularly had a hard understanding time me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldnt even distinguish between yes and no
Design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor people on other the side of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled
However after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the enters boom the ear piece
I imagine this from came adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic
The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take stress the
have I no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear its unobtrusive and light
However constantly I get complaints from whoever Im talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet
I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to an produce acceptable volume which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset
The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and the to side of the mouth
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable at for least me
Its a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about wearing jogging this
Also the insert comes very off easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert
Sound quality mediocre is as callees often complain about wind noise from my end
Apparently you need to quotknowquot your technical specs Universal does not mean Nokia so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesnt work with Nokia I get the of expense sending it back
This should be on the technical which specs are crap on this site
I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesnt work well sometimes it has connection bluetooth most but of the time it doesnt work
Yeah a its good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one
I purchased a brand new Samsung t809 and right out of the the box battery cover would not stay on the phone
I to went a genuine TMobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good halfanhour they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit
The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able get to his personal battery cover to fit
after six weeks of hassling them over the issue the end result was that the t809 battery cover is not in included the warranty
What End result I get to duct tape my battery place in
If youre going spend to serious money on a high end phone
go with a brand name that actually stands behind product their
I got this phone basically for free but even taking that into account Im pretty disappointed the with phone
This is my first Samsung and Im pretty sure my last one I owned a Nokia before and I regret that betrayed I it
From now I wouldnt get anything besides Nokia and in worst the case maybe SonyEricsson
So here is a short of list those little things that make your life with this phone and its combination with TMobile annoying
not its really comfortable to openclose the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time
putting a comma while writing a text message capitalizes the next word what is the logic in that it annoys me because i do use messages text a lot
you can only save 1 phone type for each category what if the person has 2 phones business
you cannot choose the email address of a person from the list contact when you want to send a picture message to an email address
And there is a lot more of those illogical little things that were just not thought through like it wouldve been in a Nokia even in a model 5 years old
Oh yeah and TMobile really contributed to the greatness of this phone removing some of the features and limiting others like setting your mp3 as a ringtone although there is an easy around hack it just change the extension from
I cant believe that with as technology advanced as it is Samsung could produce this giant POS
I actually refused to pay the and bill let them shut my service off
I loved the clarity of the pictures even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty and lousy I even liked the video feature
But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN IT USE Its been years since Ive had such lousy reception from a phone
Im considering taking the dealer to court over this since they pushed it on me and me told what a great phone it was
to Has be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for
Between the missing features no voice dial on 200 a phone crippled features I have to buy ringtones use their tzone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier
Anyone who would charge some much this for POS really doesnt deserve my business
Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to on use a cell and a miniphone
They are incredibly cheaply and made when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call
Essentially unusable unless we find some that trick we have missed so far
bought I 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk
They worked but never well for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from unit the
I agree with most of the others worked it okay for a couple of months
now not only does it not charge my phone but if I plug it into my it phone immediately loses all charge Its also always falling out of the lighter plug
I dont have that with problem any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets
Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr the phone complains that this an Unauthorized and Charger it will not charge the phone
I When plug the phone in it says Unauthorized Charger and refuses to charge at all
It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be charger a
I give it star one only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars
I suppose would that be bad for business but it is what it is
Avoid this cheaply made product and get real the thing
Maybe it works in China but not North in America
Have since bought a Motorolabrand one three for times what I paid for this piece of junk
Do not be attracted by a cheap tag price because you get what you pay for or what you DONT pay for in this case
This razr car charger only worked for about 1 week then working quit
The Premium Vehicle Charger Power was not compatible
Motorola one is better far in quality as well to use
The product description state should that it does not work with the Verizon V3C When plugged in it states Unauthorized Charger and will not charge at all although if the battery is dead it will give you enough juice to speak but it still wont charge
These are not the same that on come the earbud and are not easy to use or to hear from
I had an old pair they were green that worked great but I one lost
Within minutes of putting them the on earbuds they split open all three pairs If youre planning on using these for your ipod headphones look into the older colored ones I believe theyre a different material and less prone to cracking
The service was good but the product didnt have enough info me for to make a wise decision
At the end I couldnt use the on product my jabra ear piece
The item description should have information compatible on Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice
They did hold the buds in the ear better but no in gain sound quality
If you want small the and med Ill send them to you for shipping
I ear have gels before but none that were this cheap and I dont mean cost
There was no consistency in the size they come in different sizes but no were two the same
And without fail every single one I tried use to split in half after being installed on the ear piece
Every one It didnt to seem matter if they were small or larger or even larger than the ear piece
The material began just tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance
I am sure there must be a better version quality of these things somewhere
As others have mentioned the window front blanks out almost immediately and even worse it doesnt show your missed calls
It does not have any exterior lights such as my old Samsung that showed when it was charging charge when completed when a voice mail was waiting etc
While on talking phone it blacks out after about 1 minute
No Im not driving but Im a trying passenger to use my phone
is Cingular a light pastel pink TMobile is magenta dark pink
The one thing I like is that this phone a is quad band and if you travel interationally it will be great
I just the got phone so havent used it interational yet
it Oh must TMobile to get international service
The phone has a camera other plus tech features but I dont use them
I want my phone only to be phone a no other gadgets
I would never buy this phone again as and soon as Im eligible for an upgrade this phone is history
I doubt I would get a Motorola ever Ill again stick to Samsung
Each one that I had would just turn off the in middle of a call
not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off Then I would and try start it again no go So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
Half of the time it would start and say battery invalid and I would start the entire process over again
I complained so much to that Tmobile they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features except BETTER reception and an MP3 player
My husband has the silver one and the same happend thing to his
Ive always had perfectly serviceable but cell boring phones and when I saw the pink Razr I knew I wanted one
I saved my pennies and myself gave an endofschoolyear present
I have only had this phone for month a but I am horribly disappointed
It has horrible reception and I know its not the network because I tested it side by side with other tmobile and phones drops more than half of my calls
It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME in the middle conversation of while in your pocket whenever
I went back to tmobile and they are sending me a new Samsung but Im sort of disappointed that pretty my pink phone didnt live up to expectations
Sometimes It is the mistake companys and they still blame it on the customer
I Since started my plan I had a problem reciving my bill on time
So the start company charging me 5 late fee for four consecutive months
Also when I tried adding additional features such as their textmessagebundle the change on the account did not take effect till two later days and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two daysand It costed me an additional 4
Every time I tried complaining to their customer services they wouldnt just listen
I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize profit their
More than if once I stay longenough on the line they put me on mute so they dont have to listen to my complaining
I feeling I that am being treated like dirt not like a customer
had I the worst customerservices experience with tmobile
Also the is reception not the best in the country
I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the amount same of money
I purchased this item for use while my driving car in Oct of 2005 for 29
I was told it would for work the LG phones which is what I have

Maybe it works in China but not North in America
since Have bought a Motorolabrand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk
Do not attracted be by a cheap price tag because you get what you pay for or what you DONT pay for in this case
This razr car charger only for worked about 1 week then quit working
The Premium Power Vehicle Charger was not compatible
Motorola one far is better in quality as well to use

Every time tried I complaining to their customer services they just wouldnt listen
I am starting to get the feeling that they are just to trying maximize their profit
More than once if I stay longenough on the line they put me on mute they so dont have to listen to my complaining
I feeling that I being am treated like dirt not like a customer
I had the worst experience customerservices with tmobile
Also the reception is not the in best the country
I friends had who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amount of money
The product itself would have worked if great they included all the pieces
I then requested a and cord WebTreo said they would mail one to me immediately but none came
I emailed their customer again service and have received no response
The case blocks the camera eye and the clip one lasted week
Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its design POOR
The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove allows that quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective
The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear the of glove
The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove floating is inside of the rubber elastic glove
The pocket stretches As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when is it hanging on your belt like when you sit down or bump anything the connector easily and silently dislodges from its elastic pocket Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip
This is a dreadfully constructed device the that designer should be ashamed of
Ive only had it for 3 months the release broke off after 2 months I which rarely used
The swivel spins now freely and no longer rachets
The cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera it to has be held down away from the lense
Body needs Glove to send this one back to the engineers
I never got my order even after a month after placed I it
Ive had previously subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for
A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go and STI Mobile sounded like good a alternative because the price was competitive and minutes dont expire
I signed and up shortly after received my Samsung phone
It arrived defective however the port for recharging the phone was damaged
Per the STI Mobile web site I contacted them 14 within days to arrange for a replacement phone
This resulted in a number of exchanges email with customer service
In the first one the rep told me that was I mistaken and must have been sent the wrong charger
No offer was made to replace the charger strangely which was included as of part the package deal
After additional emails where I her reassured that I did in fact have the right charger I took the phone in to a local merchant who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective
At this point the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone This entire process took weeks several
If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid provider phone
It rips off your battery door when you to try take the phone off
Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytime I disconnect from it the holder
are There better holsters for the RAZR on the market
I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone they except sent me this flip phone V171
I liked my candy bar phone didnt and want this flip piece of junk
was I happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing and then things quickly went downhill
Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone even though I had minutes available on the phone old
I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her Cingular our phone which works awesome with no problems
She had to always type in the codes area for all numbers dialed even the local numbers
She also had trying problems to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send
My recommendation is to away stay from this phone and this service
Go shop Cingular for the all great deals they have
service terrible is no good ringtones my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates
Dont it get You will end up paying the same if you have a plan
I on agree it was too good to be true statement for this package
The material used earbud for and the charger is really cheap
charger melted in the car after a sunny day I couldnt test even it
Earphone quality is not good as well a giving constant humming noise
The case and ear bud are fine but the charger car I was sent doesnt even fit my Nokia 6230
Of course I wasnt expecting any name brand stuff here at but least I expected them to all work
I dont know if got I a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used
The case I didnt need but it does fit well and looks be to decently constructed
think I Ill go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbudheadset though
I recently this purchased bluetooth Scala500 and used it all about maybe 5 times
Why such a short amount of time Because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in car the with the windows up and radio off
Its a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows just up so the person on the other end can hear me
Now I keep this piece junk of in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power
If you buy this make sure you plan use to it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere
The only good thing about headset this is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone
Think twice about buying this product or check it at out your local retailer first
The one star was for ease the of setting up with my cell phone
As soon as I bought it I realized it hold doesnt the phone too well
Few days later my concerns proved them selves every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it very even carefully the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground
Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a no is longer with me
There goes a 200 phone lost because of a stupid holster 10
Do not buy product this if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericssons ICE26 that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosnt slip out of the holster
As for me I gatta get me a new phone shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really it liked
It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle have I so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo
The skin buttons do not always line up with the buttons TREO so I misfire applications
The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion slot card constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster
not Do place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly
I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement however I disappointed was
While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment after the first day it looks like its two old years
If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it the belt clip will pop card your daily
And the belt clip itself is afterthought an easily sliding off your belt
Dont even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the nonslip cover wont begin to slide into pocket your
If youre in an industrial enviroment this may be your but cover for the rest of us
Works pretty well with the but unit the belt clip SUCKS Its big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa
missed I the reviews before I ordered I shouldnt have bought it
considering the quality of headset the I didnt even try the car charger in the fear that it wouldnt follow the necessary battery charge cycle
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE I have had this phone for 6 months and I am SO disappointed Of course it worked for the first 30 days within the grace period but then I began having problems with the keeping battery charged
I took it to the local Sprint store and they gave a me new battery
That worked for few a weeks but just recently Ive started having the same problem
I just spent over 2 hours on the phone of course not MY phoneI had to use my work time Sprint with and Sanyo
Of course neither company was willing to stand behind the product so now I have to send the phone at my expense course of to Sanyo to have it repaired which will take two weeks at least
So please do yourselves a favor and pick out a phone different
I had a picture mail account with them for about years 3
Just recently without any warning whatsoever they deleted over 500 of precious my pictures from my picture mail account
pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly there sitting for most of that period of time
of Most these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever
I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered not only could they not do that but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to So me my advice DONT TRUST SPRINT Again this happened with any warning It could happen to you too Trust me avoid Sprint at all costs I should have
the menu buttons are inconviently placed such as the My content and address the icon should have been switched around for better handling
its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus connector the to the phone
Second and more important MY PHONE DOESNT WORK WITH IT ON The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone any preventing usage of the entire phone
It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better it but scrachted and broke easily
I tried to cancel the order but they said it been has shipped
I was cancelling on October 13 2006 but the package labeled that it was shipped on 17 October 2006
can How it be shipped 4 days after it was shipped
See reviews other on the problems w the leather case
I tried havent the handsfree device and probably wont bother but the case is cheap looking and the charger didnt work at all
As say they you get what you pay for Im going to an actual store and get a real Motorola accessory kit
I read the other about review these falling out of the reviewers ear
I figured at this price Id try for my wife I and
When I first tried on them I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on
Even with the provided clip these fall out and youre better not off using them
Frustrating that all cell these phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones
Two stars only because they do work if hold you them with your hands and they were inexpensive
Unfortunately the headset jack is not a standard jack but instead one to unique Samsung phones
you Therefore are forced to buy Samsungs headset
What makes worse matters is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord
Any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes ear the bud out of your ear
I hope that Samsung an creates adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones
I this think is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had
It just doesnt seem like its Nokia quality me to
I would get Samsung the slider if I could do it all over again
Battery life is subpar slider seems cheap and speakerphone breakable is not loud enough
The interface pretty is smooth but thats about it
If you have to have a simple interface then this might work otherwise but Id get the Samsung
I got this phone cause I thought it would be a nice phone little
Too little This phone is not made for someone has who med to large fingers
voice The dialing DOES NOT WORK It is hard to use
I returned the phone only after 2 DAYS I got the Samsung T629
Does almost everything the Nokia does but is better looks better performs better much
If you a are teenager this phone may be good for you
It was broken in a few days of you use should buy a hard cover instea
This headset is NOT compatible with the E62 Nokia The Nokia E62 has a 2
5mm headphone jack and not the pop port on shown this accessory
For 4 its not bad but within two weeks the black paint coming started off to reveal the white plastic looks horrible but if you dont care how the case looks then this is the case for you
It also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and snaps then off when you do
This case also hinders comunications you maks sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line
This thing doesnt slide well and the cover front falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you dont ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo
Well I was was wrongit twenty dollars completely wasted
I could not get the thing to stay put the boom mike is so bottomheavy that it wont stay close to my cheek even sitting still And it pokes out about 3 feet to the side of my head it seems like it anyway if I am moving around at all Almost like it was DESIGNED to as get far away from my voice as possible
But even holding the stupid thing with my hand did not help sound the quality
I constant got complaints that I could not be heard very well
are There only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating
Second its a decent quality just design pisspoor
And three I liked that when I clicked the button not due to incoming call automatically it launched the voice dial menu so I could really make a call without ever touching my cell phone
I guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfr for headset both and phone
But it fails at miserably its primary design goal so I heartily recommend staying away from this product
Saw good deal for bluetooth a earpiece so I took it
The installation was a little tricky at first but once i got it paired with LG an Chocolate it was functional
Tested it out all over the house and it was very staticky and distorted 10 over feet
Used driving it and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels
This product alone does NONE the of things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF
When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things which it doesnt do they pointed out where it says may 3rd require party software for various uses
I just didnt know that the of definition various was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED
I would rate my experience this with seller as Dissapointing
least At let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere
I have owned every brand of this type cable of over the years
The cable will develop a bare spot near the connector device end and short itself out
For some reason only it happens with the Palmtype cables
Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device more cables for hotsynching andor charging daily
My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs holds that the contacts firmly in place so WATCH OUT and treat this cable nicely
I like the retracting cable concept but was disappointed in easily how it got damaged
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM this On one You cant see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light
So cant you see whos calling or what time it is without opening the phone
Its third my Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Motorola should maintain consistency to keep customers loyal
Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed it for looking cool
Not to mention the fact that bumping into something oftern can knock the phone out of the holster
While it does allow phone the to swivel thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead
Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting pavement the
Im shopping for a holster and as faceplate we speak
While this is a functional holster be aware that you may like me find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from holster the
You can turn off answer the phone when opened option but that is not preferred by everyone
You may find also that the phone does not stay in the holster securely
I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would a be good company
I have never been treated so by rudely customer service people in my life
In conversations multiple and speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twice
I ended throwing up away the phone and losing my money
Im writing a review for the first time because Ive never been so dissapointed with a experience shopping
I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as gifts Christmas
It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped It was as if they were for waiting the last minute to ship me my items
Amazon has two a week policy for shipment of products
to Needless say I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts
This is the type service of I got for choosing standard shipping which was very expensive to send two little cell phone casesI cant specify how much because they wont let me post prices in reviews They also shipped them seperately
One came in appropriately an sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box
Ive decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order them from again
Great concept rubber protective skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches
The rubbery tends material to collect all sorts of dust and lint
Its very hard get to it off unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off
The protective cover doesnt fit the around screen too well
tends Mine to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right even if I try and reposition the unit itself
The plastic screen cover that can be removed already was scratched due to the way it is packaged
Its now sitting my on desk at work collecting dust
My husband and I found these cases for our new SLVRs and excited were
Unfortunatly like others have we found that they dont fit our phones
We have the style right SLVR the case just doesnt fit
purchased I this crystal case to protect my new slvr L7
The case is not wide enough fit to together over the phone
This phone case is the worse one ever for TREO the 650
Yea the is color great but if you just tap it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit ease
You have to lift it up so now you have a piece of 2 cent plastic over a hundred five dollar phone
Now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screen to it protect
Quote It easily attaches and I especially like the screen cover most cases dont have this if you drop the phone and crack the screen youre hosed
Insurance If you invest in five a hundred dollar phone then you must have insurance on it
Final I am very disappointed in the cover and recommend that you in invest another product leather
I bought this item hoping to have different something
I really should have tough about this one and this is a warning others to
I bought three of these once at and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3
5mm headset for listening to music but they didnt handle calls at everything all is full of static listening and talking
I just placed a call with it and the person answered who immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible but it was the adapter that was the problem full of static and echo
was It functional it felt solid and it had a nice low profile look
However after around a year and a half the continued act of opening and closing the phone has caused the hinge to and crack to gradually break off completely
I now have to hold the phone together with my hand I while talk which is extremely awkward
This is especially frustrating given the of rest the phone is so well made
Furthermore it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my upgrade opportunity in a couple of months and after right my purchase of some extra accessories batterieschargers
Search around online for hinge a670 and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine
This in itself wouldnt be a problem if Samsung willingly would replace the phone
However they are not claiming it as a design defect and neither nor Samsung Verizon are offering to replace it
Bad form for both although perhaps Verizon isnt much as to blame
I would avoid both Samsung and phone this because of this incident
This phone is seemingly designed to be durable but it frankly is not meant for the long haul and is too pricey given its performance average
It didnt have many features its so just a waste of your money
I am not sure if i want ever another Samusung again
I have all these accessories samsung and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust
battery this is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670
when you put it in it reads bad battery on the screen and will go further no
I dont know about other company but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally from different the picture
I bought a Genuine Contour Leather for Case Motorola Razr V3 but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic
Not only that the cover smells like oil petroleum
This is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of phone your
The outside is faux a leather made of plastic that looks convincing enough
Although the beltpocket clip held my Treo securely it was a bit bulky kept and the phone far from my body and often in the way
After a cople of days the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at time a
My old quit Tracfone working so I purchased a new one
Ive been trying for 4 to weeks transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone
Its been a nightmareafter 4 weeks 3 new sim cards and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps Ive nothing accomplished
My phone is still not activated I still dont have my old number transfered Ive and wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps
Got it put home in the sim card add the battery and changed the phone
Once it was charged went I to activate the phone it said insert sim
I redid several times called support got the run around it becaused did not understand my error
When I a got person she said the same thing after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card the lady said they would have to send me a new phone mind was broke
So we will see the if new one is better next week when it comes
Weve had 3 of the LG1500 in our plan family for nearly a year
When our calling son I would get a message that his number was blacklisted
After calling Cingular several we times demanded new phones
were We told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing
If a phone doesnt work the company needs to get rid them of
I got the phone because it was small but I didnt know Id be sacrificing much so
The only speakerphone works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day
I get shoddy service and while i do like the there design are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing
All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but its really not the best for what youll want to do with your cell phone
I paid 10 dollars for this and phone have spent almost 40 on sim cards
The phone say will Insert SIM Card even if it is inside
It recyles and when it does so the screen goes blank and if you talking were on the phone your call is dropped
is There a VERY minimal selection of graphics ringtones and games
Save your money because you might end up spending 4050 bucks on SIM cards and another 50 for a phone replacement
My wife and I got two of these phones for when free she switched to Cingular
After two weeks we exchanged her phone for new a one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly
phone My was fine but has lately been experiencing the same issues
I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the areas same
Sometimes Ill have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes 0 to and takes a minute or two to come back
Even though it iswas free not its worth the frustration
I got this phone in January and I to had take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls
They gave me a new thinking one that it was just that phone
The one I have now isnt as bad as the first one but still it loses service and drops calls constantly
I thought Motorola StarTac my very first phone was bad till wait use this phone
First it keeps complaining to insert sim card although inserted its properly
Went to store Cingular got the new sim card works ok for a day
this Did 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones
Now one of the two doesnt complain about the sim card but occationally it says its not in the network it although shows full bars
I just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim issue card but cant talk more than a minute
It just drops a call the in middle of conversation
I now am trying to get a 4th phone replacement but not sure if they will issue it
I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months go to what a nightmare
We were for looking a very basic flip phone capability no bells and whistles needed
Our major use was communicate to between each other
Since we then have experienced all the problems mentioned
Yesterday we again replaced our sim on card the same phone
The major problems have included service not even available though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location unable to read insert card and of course dropped calls
Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to our resolve most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call
At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an solution alternative
headset NOT COMPATIBLE with the Nokia 1100 different Completely connector type
Totally impractical this model smartphone already is fairly bulky this just makes it as lot more so
Even worse you cannot attach it to your belt or because pocket there are no clips and or loops in the design
The construction is shoddy very bad leather quality made in China
The USB cable and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone through purchased Xcingular
The phone does indicate it that is charging through the cable
Uninstalled the and software tried again with firewall shut off
Connecting a USB device should be NOT this difficult
I bought this case to protect the best bar phone the on market the Sony Ericsson W810I
Within 2 Days the case already started to and crack chip
I dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out the of case
The only good thing is that it nice looks and stylish but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon
Bottom Line This case only against protects scratches
I actually was looking at the Clear Silicone Cases
my car adapter lasted for about a week and then it broke and case my riped on the 2 day
Unless you have a CD with a program that is specific to your this phone cable
First The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be to attached the case with 4 screws
Third Only the case is black all other parts are plastic clear
Bought 10 of them for 36 each cents spent 35 dollars on shipping
Now i have to thru go the process of trying to get a full refund
However after about 3 weeks duller the not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off
I was so disappointed I took it and off went with my original cover
looks It really bad and just looks like something Ive had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks
As you can tell from the item name product this should have been compatible with my phone
However when installing the cd you are asked to pick your phone from list the
Then I got a message saying it corrupt woulrd my computer if I continued to download
Howeverwho wants to send it back for a refund when lose you shipping and the shipping was as much as the item
Unfortunately did I not read the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity
After it had finished installing Windows XP came up with an error message that stated the completion of this could installation cause corruption with the operating system
The only support I received was to send to me a competitors homepage and try to download their software
The software provided did not work and it did not include the VX8300 model There was no contact information for the manufacturer and I spent hours upon hours an finding appropriate driver plus I had to find software to use this thing
USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in it works now but has to be held in hand by
Came with instructions no and if you dont have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers you wont be able to figure this out
The driver CD is useless more or less since they dont send you a product number is which needed to access the menu on the CD
It works and I am able to send files to and from my phone but this is after approximately two three or hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer and a whole lot of cursing
I wont be ordering anything from them again and if I had it to do over Id order the cable from different a company
I was able to get cable this working eventually after some research on my own
but I had to locate the correct drivers on my own and its definitely not intuitive and definitely plugandplay not
Support from the seller consisted of referring me to competitors a website to locate the drivers on my own
Also and with no offense intended if you think a driver is a person a behind steering wheel then this is not the product for you
It took a week and half to receive it 3 days get to confirmation for the order only and they ship by regular mail
then theres a single protective screen precut a in plastic it doesnt cover well the whole screen surface its about 12 mm narrower and its very tough hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath I had to take it off immediately then once removed from place its a waste
I bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my cu500 lg and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics even though it is more its worth it
This cable shorts out the connection on phone my imediately after connecting
It costs more to ship it back then it does to it replace
I will chalk this up to you what get you pay for
case The fit well but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart
Im very gentle with my phone but little the pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one
THe is bottom still on great but it dosnt do me any good without a top
I ordered a threepiece set of an earpiece phone cover and car charger for my Motorola phone i860
When I get the order the phone cover custom supposedly was too small for phone my
My worked earpiece temporarily then it started shocking me now it doesnt work
The only piece the one I didnt need that worked was the charger car
Net10 cell phones are great but dont buy card this
Net10 is not set up to handle minutes 3000 cards
I the put pin in my phone and did not receive the minutes
called I technical support and received 1000 minutes
I was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me I that will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days
I put the multiclip on my belt and the metal spring bent out of shape
I found another clip from another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster also broke
This clip with came the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone
The second day that I had the case I lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all the of pieces went everywhere and it wasnt able to be fixed
I am unhappy about clip the mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner
I would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but around sitting at a desk
I dont know if it was just my clip or if all them of are made poorly
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant see anything in the window outer especially in the sun light
So you cant see whos calling or what it time is without opening the phone
Its my third Motorola and the prompts are than different others
Motorola should maintain consistency to keep customers loyal
Thought the functioning of phone this was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Excellent highres LCD but the rest of the phone was disappointment a
Poor overall interface with options configuration in nonintuitive locations
Particularly disappointing was it how handled WiFi
Each application seemed to want to tied be to a particular wireless source
So Id go home and try to get it on the wireless but Id have to bring up the app let it spin a while be told it couldnt connect then Id have to it tell to use the local WiFi
The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that is this unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone and a very expensive an bulky one at that
I can check and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to an get appication running and connected via WiFi
Much better management WiFi is a must before Id consider this phone
This is a serious example of one device trying to do everything doing and nothing very well
The device is relatively nice I but gave it two stars because a 500 price tag means it has to deliver
I wouldnt this buy unless its an emergency because its one of those chargers that reports errors and makes your phone start beeping nonstop when its done charging
I dont want this because I like charging at night the other chargers dont do this I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power the from wall like switching off when the battery is fully charged
so it beeps as if its being in plugged over and over
When I first got it I was trying to carefully plug it into my phoneand I didnt want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on charger the
It wasnt going in and smoothly it didnt match up or seem to fit inside at ALL
So I went a day without a phone and I did more research to see why the heck theyd lie that it my fit phone
I Finally got fed up because I couldnt find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it
But it was so charging I was happy my cell is my only phone
Then I tried getting it out and figure couldnt it out I had to jimmy it off and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secure itself
I was able put to it back on and finally learned a routine so to speak for taking it off but its cheap
So the charger works its but very hard to use and it isnt convenient at all
This adapter was supposed to ww600i charge as listed but it did not even fit it
totally Its false information being given for this item
cant belive Amazon has these merchants untrustworthy
charger This works but apparently not quite the way Sony Ericsson would like it to
When using this charger my W300i SE often reports charging errors
never This happened with the original SE charger which my dog ate hence the new one
A very basic phone not with one good ringtone display or wallpaper
I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for that keys werent working
Cant use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia well worked
There are some nice things but these are externals and certainly not explained in the manual user
theres a composer in the phone to your compose own ringtone
First you pay the for ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it
The saving grace was the ability to send the to ringtones myself by searching for methods on the internet
I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that could i hear the phone when its in my purse
However putting the phone on vibrate buried was in the menus and not in the user manual
Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen i so could easily change it to vibrate
I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn off it in a theater
Youre being responsible the and phone does that annoying Moto noise
Its only silent when you shut it down from ringing silent
Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons you get noisy tones as you the lower volume
I must live on edge the of Cingulars and everyone elses coverage area
This phone cant hold a call at my house and I have problems with it dropping calls even it when shows several bars strength
Part of the problem is the coverage area part but is the phone too
I have who friends have made and received calls from my home with no problem
If you live like I do in a pothole on the Superhighway Information avoid this phone
Im on my 3rd v180 in less a than year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it under warranty for another
Unfortunately they have the option of sending you a refurbished model which means that they tried to fix someone problem elses phone and pawn it off on you
This one is going to get flushed as as soon I find another phone to buy since Cingular says its now out of warranty and Im not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months
I had to change 4 phones in one year cingular with
I gave this one because star there is not an option for zero stars
Sim card does not store the full information each on contact and is therefore useless
Sim failed card after less than 1 month and had to be replaced
Foolish designer attached vibrator module to flat cable connecting base piece to piece hinged
The vibration causes the cable to delaminate and soon the vibrate doesnt work and the eventually screens fail and you have to order replacement phone
Less contact fuctionality of of any my previous phones ie
One of my 3 phones in a 8 month span failed after a of fall 10 onto the floor
I have to disassemble the phone and clean the microphone every month or so or no one can hear talking me
The clam shell cracked almost immediately and got just worse
The car charger works so keeps this the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package
One thing my boyfriend and I learned through this experience is to for pay known quality and performance in the long run you save money hassle and time
50 as I recall plus shipping I ordered the Bargaincell Brand New Ikross Retractable car lighter cigarette adapter
I suppose I could have packaged it up and it sent back at a cost to me and probably received a replacement
But for the cost of the unit it was not worth time my
I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but work doesnt with it
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK It is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from phone cell to computer I wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer
the cable comes with a id number on it and you to have get the driver off the disk that comes with it
I have on tried 2 different computer systems to make it work
I dont know if the was cable marked with the wrong number or what the problem is
The disk 40 has files on it I dont know if one of the other drivers would work but I am very frustrated
I bought this battery to replace the original one that came with cell my phone
The new one holds a charge a time shorter than the old one does I have to charge it every day whether I use it or not
I only buy because it I must to have a battery backup for long trips and I cant wait for the seidios battery
Well the only good thing one can say the about Treo 680 battery is that its thinner
The battery for the Treo 650 basically got through one a normal business day
As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 45 hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that to come mind are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable
Im really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy battery the with Treo 680
But happily there is a fix quick buy 12 more batteries and keep them charged and dont leave home without them
Unlike the review other I can not recommend this at all
The GPS regularly takes least at 10 minutes to find satellites sometime longer the Palm needs to be resynced bluetooth with the GPS at least once a month
The first time I tried to place the 7290 the in case it split at the seams
battery The was not accepted by my motoraola phone
Unfortunately discovered I it after the expiration of the Amazon return date
I bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge after in sitting a closet for a year
I was to thrilled get a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again
opened I it up put it in my phone tried to close the battery cover and it would not close
If I forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latch but it was actually bending plastic the of the phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment
The battery is about 50 thicker than the standard for battery a Motorola v60
Might be great for the extra battery life but bad if you cant get get the battery on cover your phone
I give it two stars because the battery may work fine for all I know but it fit wont in a v60
but a belt clip is placed vertically making it obtursive cumbersom and
Although its listed under the accessories section for V66 the it is NOT for the V66
Well I guess it will work with just phone the but not the extra battery
No in sense having this if it doesnt charge the second battery
I checked it out on the Motorola and site in fact it is the wrong one
This charger is the Motorola SPN5029 which work doesnt with the V66 and 2nd battery
Before buying this phone from Amazon I called Palm and they told me that there would be a year 1 warranty on this item as long it is new
I subsequently bought this unlocked version the of phone and I am using it on the TMobile network
I now have a problem on the within display 2 months of purchase
I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech they support asked me to read out my serial number
It starts with a HAGA they which indicate means that it has to be on the ATT Wireless Network
According to them I am in violation of the since warranty I am using it on the TMobile network
How am I know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my purchase If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone obviously I need the flexibility to to move a different network
is Palm taking the easy way out they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon
If any of you had have better luck with Palm or have any suggestions please let me know
The price high is considering that there are newer models
This was the second 600 Treo that I got from Amazon
three com weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working
When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does cover not keyboard failure then I called Tmobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset
I called back on satuday 02042006 Palm told me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or pay 25 to get premium a exchange option and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day
I called back on the following Wednesday said palm to wait untill Friday
Called On Friday they said that it could shipped be on Monday
I asked to refunded be my 25 because they lied on the terms the operator said that she could not
That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a 650 Treo
Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have had ever
Ill spare you the since details theyve been documented well elsewhere
I will add that After my 4th phone dying on I me decided to cancel my service with Cingular which renders my locked phone a 400 paperweight
gone Ive over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS
Palm a was good company once now they have got their heads up their
Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running now Windows
I have to start with by saying that I am indeed very a happy user of T600 for almost two years
IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still me keeps excited
The device can be used for phone calls calendars browsing web email IM ICQ AOL etc
internet radio stations editing document games modem for the laptop
So why only two stars and why poor execution Very poor voice call quality reported by many and totally unacceptable Luckily for me and some others one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with foil the
It worked but it should never had to necessary be
When you go to install the driver youre supposed select to your phone from the list
Well it just so that happens the list is extremely incomplete and my phone wasnt on there which probably means that yours wont be either
Dont waste your time on this cable and just buy the music essentials kit that is actually made for phone this
The product arrived and fine on time from AccessoryOne
But the cable would stay not connected in the USB port on my computer
I had to hold it just right for the cable to connected stay
I threw this cable away and wound up buying Verizons Music Kit Essentials for my LG VX8600
The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver work that fine
Thanks that God the phone can survive a moderate fall
case The pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case its all loose after that
Another disappointment the circular knob that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out again causing you guessed it falls
1 Superior protection I have my dropped phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case
2 All buttons accessible though a bit difficult to to get in cases
1 Signal quality worse is when the phone is in the case
2 Belt clip useless since the case can easily open spilling out the when phone on ones belt
3 Side ok button difficult to press same with top two front front above buttons start and ok buttons
Usable only for protection during and transportation does this well
When I recieved this I item had mixed emotions for the product
On one hand the black finish looked very nice and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but still was easy to read
Also all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach averagesized with fingers except maybe the camera button so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard
However due to the padding and the of nature the metal materials the case is very thick and bulky when using the belt clip the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip but leans at an angle
BUT the factor deciding in my twostar rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 which at such a steep price is not something I like to drop
The lies problem with the snapshut system that closes the case
Because the metal is so thin it does not secure well very and can come open pretty easily
To fix this I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone so that it was harder much to both open and close the case
This for the most part solves the but problem it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order
My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard without open actually taking the phone out of the case
This is nice because it enable quick replies text to messages
This is the only reason I did not give it a rating onestar
I am currently looking for a soft case preferably leather a sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip rather than bother with a clip anymore
As a final warning BE CAREFUL if buy you this case
Plus seriously I do not believe it is worth its steep price point
You have to open it to slide out the full keyboard making it vulnerable damage to
It doesnt matter whether you open the or case not
If it drops the case falls right open anyway spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protect the from 8525
The case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you it wear
The case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged least at thats what happened to me
Super disappointed in this in product case you couldnt tell
My complaint about the belt clip it is of made inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use
Please please buy dont this just by seeing the photos
It looks nice and great but practically this is a piece junk of
it makes buttons more deep down there by inaccessible making
stylus The grove is not good there by making stylus to project out and it will slip
It opened and my fone hit the ground thrice and i cingular doesnt insure instrument this
It cannot sustain the weight of the total with phone the case
Once i hook up this fone to the i belt dont want that my fone would twist and turn
and the worst of allwhen the flip faces downwardswhich happens by twist and turnsthe flip opens and cell fone hits ground wowowwww such a nice design to piece a of junk and hats off to the lousy designer and I hate my self for buying this
The phone fits nicely but that latch NOT is secure
With in 30 minutes of having it my came phone out and hit the tile floor at a customers house
Tons of fun watching your 500 PDA hit the ground and the battery flying come out
Phone is ok but the case is getting ASAP replaced
Originally I purchased this heavyduty case to protect my new 8525 expensive
However wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip my phone fell of out the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up
Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged but have I several big dents and scratches on the case
Im going to stop using a case now the since phone is now already beatup
The latch mechanism for the cover will loosen with up use especially since youll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen
Also took it a bit getting used to to have to open the case to make a phone call
The overall quality of this case is very good tho because it fits the phone very snuggly and holes the line up to all the buttons
I guess its a great if case you dont wear it on your belt
But I cant justify such a case huge if I carry it in my pocket
I dropped my Treo enough times break to it and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case
I have a LG VX5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with was no a go
Product would not install from enclosed CD computer not would recognize cell phone through enclosed USD cord
I have ordered since received and installed from another product Data Point from another vendor
Maybe its because this product not is approved for windows but I couldnt get it to install
Yes cable the fits but the CD driver is just for the 8300
The doesnt cover fit snug with the phone the stitching broke after two weeks and the release button is triggered from the bottom
Today it fell off in a parking lot when i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and it found had been run over by a car
This is a poor quality product and I wouldnt recommend to it anyone
Ive had a case silicone on my Treo 650 for a long time
It was thin and the rubber was very grippy great antislip once I left my Treo on top of my car NOT recommended and drove 10 miles and case the was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it
The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original case so much so that its difficult to use the 5way navigator without it what doing I didnt want it to do
The case is not as nearly grippy and slides off my car seat unlike the original
Boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive since this I isnt probably wont bother
But in my opinion theres products better out there
These cables are aftermarket usually and made somewhere in Asia
With being that said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped
The software being too aftermarket has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone
Despite what the descriptions say this software and are cable not compatable with Mac at this time
I ordered one these of a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life
After about 12 of months use the thing shorted out and wouldnt work any more
I decided to another get one because it was cheap and figured Id give it another chance
the didnt thing even work out of the box this time
spend the money on a Motorola brand instead charger
When I started my charging K750i it didnt charge at all no matter what
I bought item this thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a this model is listed in the description
First off the CD that comes with the cable data does not have my phone model on it making it useless
figured I this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from Sony Ericssons website
After downloading the software and following the instructions to TEE a I was still unable to link up my computer with my phone
I even uninstalled and reinstalled the again software in case I made an error
All told this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing Amazon with
However the generic LG driver software that with comes the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesnt have an authenticity signature
I dont know about other computers mine but with Windows XP SP2 wont accept it
Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that Motorolas hardware was very good that but their software left a lot to be desired
Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came to time start a new cell plan
I had the made decision to switch to Tmobile and this looked like one of the best phone options
off Right the bat I found out that the people who criticized Motos software were right on the money
There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone not the least of which is the frankly idiotic way the phone book designed is
Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it to seemed work well enough as a phone
As time went by I started noticing that I was missing a lot calls of
The phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my when desk suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before
During the course of the last few months phone the is less than a year old Ive also found that it has begun crashing
or Opening closing it will result in a white screen of death
Putting it on the charger will cause it switch to back and forth between the messages that it is charging that it is unable to charge and that its SIM card cannot be found after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off
a With full battery charge it will continually shut itself off
At this point I am forced to that conclude this phone is an absolute piece of junk
I am also to forced conclude that it isnt the only model which is
None of my coworkers ever has had a good experience with a Motorola phone
My wifes Motorola has shown its own host problems of
People working for Tmobile at several stores I have visited have confided that they never ever recommend Motorola phones anyone to
In fact Ive had Tmobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them but rather to for shop an unlocked Nokia online
Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every night restart it five or six times a day keep and apologizing to my friends family and employers for always missing their calls
The is sound low staticky and it frequently dropped calls
I was sold on the AAA power battery source because the rechargeable ones wont last on a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlet to recharge
However I have to say the audio output when adjusted to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler highway at speeds
The wind and engine noise is much higher than in a and car similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft
The advertisements criminally overstate the talk and standby time well as
With a regular new Duracell AAA I battery get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby
And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable battery I get only 6 hours of standby time before the hearing low battery tone
As for the marketing department at Motorolla I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product lacks that stated function and durability
I you hope enjoy earning a check based on lying to people
Hint Get a job that contributes actually to society versus fleecing society
After 18 months of service my original battery was nearing the end of life its
Instead of updating to a newer phone accompanied by a new 2year service agreement opted I to purchase a new battery
Waste of money The new offers battery approximately one day of standby power which means I must recharge nightly
That was the same predicament I encountered with original the battery nightly recharge
This battery was no better the then old battery it replaced
Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with use no
The headphone has a standard 8mm plug and wont with work the Katana
The software that comes with this is not right the software for the VX8500
Havent really it used but attempted to as soon as i recieved it
not its showing my phone on any of the software programs after i hook it up using the USB cable
the nokia bl4c battery i got is a counterfeit with fake 0406040703000042032 number
It did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into garbage the can
I had one of the first Razor and phones it did not fit
When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR upgrade to my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip
would I no recommend this product to anyone even if it does cost a dollar
You will still need to buy the AC for cord this unit
and i still havent been able to figure how out to use it
i other had phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use
THis product seems to be a lot harder unless its the wrong data cable which it shouldnt since be its advertised as an EnV data cable
The first problem encountered I with this came right after I took it out of the box
Both connectors covered were by labels which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pull them off
I spent about an hour just to trying get them clean enough to use
Second problem when came I popped in the software disc
It turned out to be nothing more a than readme file linking me to drivers that didnt even work
I spent 2030 another minutes searching the net for drivers that worked
The cable worked itself fine after I managed to clean the connectors off find the appropriate drivers and download Windows Media Player
Be aware if you a have Chocolate with V5 firmware you wont be able to use programs like BitPim with this cable
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON CORNERS ALL
I received this and item the blue illuminated cap is not present on this item
There is a less expensive product in the marketplace w a mere blue LED that looks similar and product that costs about 10 less Best Buy
While certainly this product works satisfactorily and the price is decent you should realize that what youre going get to is not what is pictured
Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective died and ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a cell phone battery last longer than a month They refuse to or refund replace
They are a shady company and Ill never business do with them again and will warn others to do the same
Ive had car chargers before for cell other phones and never experienced any problems
I attracted was to this one by the low cost but I guess you get what you pay for
It for lasted about two uses and then quit altogether
The charger got I did not fit the Motorola V188 wrong connecter
This product is not what its cracked up be if looking for a screen protector elsewhere look
I can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the look screen bad
Waste of 10 and service customer wont respond to my email matter of fact email to customer service didnt ever deliver
Bought a cell battery phone that of course died one week past their returnrefund deadline
Refused to refund or replace even though the is product CLEARLY defective
This company is a ripoff and will do never business with them again
This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on surface the of the screen
I attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughly between each attempt cleaning the Cingular with screen a new lens cloth
Once specks of dust touch the adhesive theyre there for good and the is protector ruined
I gave up because I was more worried scratching about the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid Save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in
I have had to exchange my Verizon Pink Motorola Razr 3 times Luckily I purchased the insurance
Im going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr this last phone only lasted few a weeks
The phone works fine then all of sudden one day 12 the buttons stop working and then when you flip phone the open the is on the screen and you cant get to anything
No phone numbers no voicemail no text nothing messages It is extremely frustrating
What is point the of a cute phone that doesnt work
i moved miami to and cannot get reception anywhere
it cuts me off minute the i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk
i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment so i wasting am tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates
but heres the thing other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem they actually get a couple bars of reception whereas i always one have or none at all
i returned the and phone all they could do was give me another just like it
i actually had over 30 dropped calls in month one
i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless want i to purchase another one for full price
on top of that people are right when they say battery the life is ridiculous
unless you never talk on it the wears battery out in a hurry
and the buttons volume on the side are very hard to use when talking
i usually end up putting it on speaker by phone accident
i am to trying decide which is the lesser of two evils
chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one or wasting money on a line land
whatever do you dont get suckered in by its cute pink color because underneath its pretty exterior its junk
I got it because I needed a phone new it was only 40 bucks and its pink
Yesterday after charging the phone the ENTIRE night took it off charger the about 8am for work
I made a 5 minute phone call 6 a minute phone call entered a number into my contacts entered an event into my calendar received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping low battery
Remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years Thats ago what is here
The date and time continuously dont display on the outside screen
I dont have a clock in my office I have a very small office and work for a nonprofit and I dont wear watch a Im constantly opening my phone to see the time its ridiculous
I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am able to speak to before them the battery goes dead
If you want a cutesy phone and you speak for than less 10 minutes a day this is a great phone
After my Nextel phone started acting up I decided to switch because services I liked the Razr style and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the In calling was a bonus
I have had this phone all of 3 days and miss already my Motorola i860
You can import only a couple of MP3s before the phones is memory full unless you buy their 50 transflash card 1 gig is the largest
Then you cannot assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either a major disappointment for again me missing my i860 with its 400 ringtones that I imported from random WAV midi and MP3 files
You cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either the and calendar is hard to input events you have to set a reminder for all there is no option for no reminder
All in all not what I grew to accustomed with my i860
Im already the thinking 175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the life of my 2year contract
And that leads me to another ripoff with Verizon they charge you an extra 35 to sign only a oneyear term Next time Ill read the fine print and just upgrade Nextel my
well im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my amazon own account and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it
first off it takes about seconds eight to clear to the home screen and that takes forever the phone in general is slow
Im with stuck this phone for a while and am not to happy with it
I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY features positive
The viewing screen is so small that I cant even read the time and it not does give the option to use larger font size
The battery dies about three hours being after charged even if I havent used the phone
It does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has service Verizon
am I forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and I cant find any way change this
Holds the phone well for a few months untils the on clips the side loosen and break
After that happens the phone out falls pretty easily
and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a clasp magnetic
This is a very basic holster and often is simple best but not this time
good The news the 8700 slips right in and out with ease the swivel works great and the clip is reasonably secure
A minor issue becuase its plastic when the virbrate ring is active it an makes annoying rattle sound
real The problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs one on each side
Everyday use must weaken the plastic becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case which meant that they would 8700 not stay put
It slipped out and fell to the several floor times
replaced I the case and a month later the tabs on the new case broke too
Due to cheap build quality Id suggest you look at case thirdparty options instead of this one
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt but fit eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic
The I reason gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call
I suggest you get a leather on they alot work better
have I gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months
It used to be only 6 each so it didnt matter too much Nextel sells theirs for 1520 usually
But if you are for looking a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replace them feel free to buy this item
Now that they have raised the price to 10 Ill probably not buy this and anymore get the better one at Nextel
mean I really how old is your phone Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired
The Liion batteries usually last around 18 months hence at 18mon bunch a of ipod users are gonna get pissy when the ipod doesnt work anymore and you cant change the battery
you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 on hr standby at first and then drop down to 4 hr on standby
Why have you noticed yet how that hot phone is running it is cooking its internal electronics your ear and the battery
when you get a new the phone new one will only have a 90day warranty
you will spend at an least hour with them on the phone
as Just a note to any Motorola i530 users this belt clip does not fit the phone
The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone snap to into the lock groove
This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola but phone I have no way to find out as I only own an i530
was that great plug it in it didnt fit so wigle it in
i tryed again this time i grip the tightly base the base split in two
more one time this time the coper piece got smashed
I ordered a PC case that came in a box 1000 times then larger what this was shipped in for 10 dollar shipping but I ordered 5 of these for myself and co workers and shipping was 22 dollars
I purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came my with phone
My old battery would not hold a charge anymore so I wanted a one new
I dont its think a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead
Would not recommend this ordering if youre looking to replace an old one
I ordered 6 universal adjustable cigarette lighter splitters
I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non kind adjustable not at all like the ones shown
The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going pay to to send them back
I never got an about email the substituation or response to my calls or email to the company
the other reviewer run couldnt much power through his splitter but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers etc
I wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger so I great thought
The light little goes on but the radar detector doesnt go and the cell phone charger doesnt go
Ill probably take it apart see andd if I can rewire it
I really cant buying recommend one of these things from this manufacturer
Theres nothing quotuniversalquot about this product
Itll split lightweight stuff like cell phones but dont trust anything more than demanding that with this splitter
I hooked my laptop up through it and fuse the blew within one second
Sadly Id bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself and ALL FOUR died when I tried with them my laptop
The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps which seemed reasonable so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most so not only is this busted but they lie on package the
I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse and then it worked a for short time until I started smelling plastic melting it turns out even one of the springs inside couldnt handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it
I give this item two stars because only you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously
I have three had of these during my two year contract I am trying to baby the last one enough until the end of the two years
Each has the had problem of powering down and rebooting without warning
The are billed as Milspec this or that unless but you keep it inside a purse get ready for many trips to the Sprint store
Motorola used to be THE name in communications after but this and my friends problems with the Razrs Im headed to Nokia
My office has numerous i530 phones that came with contract our
No person in our has office ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance
Battery life is terrible out of the box the interface is clunky and our personal phones half with the bulk have at least twice the overall performance
If everything else in your is life perfect then this phone is for you it will give you SOMETHING to complain about
For rest the of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your NextelSprint network contract
have I had nothing but problems with these phones
Each time I went to repair I it had to be on a waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model
I would get it repaired only to have do to it again a few weeks later
Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery charging not
They will not admit phones these are pieces of crap
When I I call wait for an eternity througha million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them
The 2 last phones stopped and charging are not able to be repaired
If this one goes Im canceling my Nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a carrier new
Ive had it Nextel Motorola and cant figure out that this phone is JUNK
My problems nextel with did not stop when I canceled my service
When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired I of course wanted to keep number my
as So I went to get my Cingular phone highly recommended I had the old number switched to my new number
Today get I in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a 200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over
This was on on icing the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel
In my town not a small town by any means there very are few places that have any service
In the largest you subdivision cannot get service anywhere
I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the nextel classic line
Please hold while the subscriber nextel you are trying to reach is located
Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls calls would go straight to my voice mail
Not only would I not the get calls but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later
When I did actually take calls and call out I cannot count the number of times Ive had call my dropped
I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of error different messages to program into their phones
That brings to me the selling point of nextel the famed and wellloved direct connect feature
Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to it use
Even then in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by loud the beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore
course Of I would expect nothing less from the nextel network
If it did not take hours to or send recieve a message it took days or maybe didnt even come at all
The access internet was fine it the rare instance that it worked
Of course when you dont have you service dont get the internet access either
I constantly was getting the message network not available
Calling trying and to complain to nextel is futile
Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once get you through they do nothing
My experience with nextel has been nothing of short a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel
Stick with Verizon or Cingular you and will be much happier in the end
My wife and I got both this phone at the same time
I chose it because it claims to be rugged the and price was right
Well we have had them around for six months and they are both not working right
My wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case so her i560 now pink wears
after Shortly it started resetting itself randomly
She would pick it up just to find that needed she to enter the SIM password
At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change but later my started phone doing the same thing
Now my phone reset will itself at least four or five times a day
I cannot absolutely believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect
Anybody can one ship bad product but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable
I purchased 2 i560 phones one me for and one for my husband
Brand new out of the box 1 of them had bad a microphone you could hear the person talking but they couldnt hear you
Nextel Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days but I raised a stink finally and got it replaced since it was broke from day 1 I didnt want a serviced phone
Here are we 3 months later 1 of the phones has a bad microphone AGAIN and the other phones keypad just went bad
We dont these mistreat phones at all in fact we hardly ever use them
Motorolla Nextels warranty is also worthless we have to pay to ship our phones to and Motorolla we dont get them back for 15 days
I am stuck with a year 2 contract with Nextel the service has been horrible and the i560 phones are lemons junk I would NEVER buy a i560 phone again or use NEXTEL their service is terrible
yes And many times the person on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking aka drunk
bought I this phone at the same time I bought the i870
Ive dropped my i870 a couple times of and its fine
My husband dropped the rugged phone and once the antenna which sticks out like a thumb snapped off
Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable army to standards
What army DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE unless of course also you want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months
Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the which i530 I loved
I was at the end of a 2 year contract and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles and was excited about the color screen with icons the
of Two my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well
I would have purchased one of those except I didnt really care about a camera for my phone and this one was priced reasonably
and I found out you get what you pay for The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750 i870 and my even old i530
I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having with trouble the clarity of my calls I could hear them but they couldnt hear me
A couple of times had I the screen go to Airplane Mode even when I hadnt touched it
fact The that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside too
My previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling but I had a holster could that hold the phone without disengaging it
When charging the phone it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight and to check that is says device attached it comes easy out and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly
Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker stops just working
Living in California apparently gives us advantage an 30 day risk free guarantee
Fortunately we were on day 12 and after 54 minutes one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents finally I received a return authorization and placed a new order
Hoping the new one on way its works much better
I got this as phone part of a buyoneget one free promotion
I changed from Cingular because I couldnt stand bill my being constantly wrong
Within the first two months phone my already malfunctioned
While talking my to wife on the phone the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen
Next all could I hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key
The phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command turn to off
Once I removed battery the and placed it back into the phone the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode
This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could it disable altogether
My wifes phone to had be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone
Mine is currently its on way to Motorola to be repaired
I was seconds away from ordering charger this for my Mothers V170
THANKS for the reviews you have saved me time money frustration for letting me know it work wont
I would have thought that amazon would have fix the problem that it did not v170 fit
I my bought wife a brandnew v170 for her birthday
She wanted an extra to charger take to work so I bought this one
Big mistake It simply would not fit in charger the jack
Last night when my wife was cleaning the counter she threw it in trash the brandnew box and all
it 99 wasnt even worth the trouble to try to return it
I saw the other review that it said didnt work for V173 but I bought this anyway for my V170
Amazon Why is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me
The jack doesnt fit in the hole of phone the on the Motorola V173
First the pros clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as screen the protecting them from wear
Fit is tight the so case takes up little additional space in my pocket
Now cons dirt and debris easily finds way its between the plastic and the phone
this exacerbates actually the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone
When I to tried remove the phone for cleaning the side of the case ripped
All in all I would not have this bought product again
I wanted to give it only one star but maybe its a little better the than original
It still goes down by the end of day the and I dont like the bulge
My equipment is a Nokia 6225 I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional SP4 and Windows XP Pro and both works dont
They dont know the device and with the PC Suite of Nokia it is not either connected
I assumed that I would get a DKU5 which is supposed to according work to the Nokia site
However I a got DKU2 which does indeed connect to my phone 6016i but is recognized by neither Win XP nor Linux
The part number have should been properly displayed somewhere
The indicates packaging that it is in fact Nokia part
If you are buying to this connect to a Nokia phone beware
is It a nonNokia part and will no easily interface with the Nokia software
It uses a different than chipset the Nokia data interface cable which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers
You may be able to get working it but I have spent about four hours and have not met with success
I even installed the serial PL2303 driver but I could not make it work
If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial so port you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed
Youll yourself save some head aches and heart aches
The cord does connect to my phone but computer the does not register the phone
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wording that they to use describe it is incorrect
To me the words charge all at once means I that can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall
item This is simply a method for organizing you devices
Although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth 34 the
99 I paid and if it wasnt a gift and wasnt Christmas 3
I feel that by using words the charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650 and did so last January by upgrading to the 680 Treo
I have been a faithful of customer Palm technology since 1997 and for the first time I am disappointed
Of I course still have the friendly Palm OS tailor made for smart phones
I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15000 records stored in the Treos four applications main
But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands contrary to the 650 buttons too are close to each other
Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired especially compared with the after 650 firmware update
Finally I use Intellisync for dual sync with both Palm userfriendly Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo Intellisync new version added a record number in the note field of all my records I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with MS Office 2007 compatibility
Nokias low blow to Palm It is time Palm responds a with decent dual sync solution of their own
The good news they is fixed a lot of the things about the Treo 650s interface that were clunky and it seems to crash less but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience so much so that I wish I had never upgraded to the 680
I upgraded to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems dont all Treo 650s from suffer that within a years usage and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems
I loved my Treo 650 anyway so expected I something equivalent to the 650 but what I got was a smartphone with quite a stupid battery life
I have decided that there is definitely some glitch design in some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card that is causing power to run right out of the phone in a sharp decline even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled
Add this to the fact that Palms websites online user group is not active right now so no users can visibly discuss this among themselvesand you dont have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward when they recently dumped this cheaper smartphone on the market recently
Palm all I can say is pretty stupid and wonder this if was your last hurrah before exiting the smartphone market
When my Treo 270 died I bought a used 270 Ebay on
Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 Amazon on
I called Palm tech support on I issues had with it dial up networking didnt work on internal browser with TMobile
Forgive me for saying but it the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be
I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser even though I told him first hand that I used it all time the did he think I was lying to him
He knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a constantly supervisor keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time
After a few calls like this with no I resolution gave up and decided to return the 650
I was uneasy of the idea switching of to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try
For me it was a huge mistake Pocket PC a is joke and completely unintuitive
They expect you to how study to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface
Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use but cmon when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning I dont want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for to it work properly
Finally I give on up Pocket PC sold it on Ebay and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out
The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 as compared to the 650 and I it buy unlocked directly from Palm
Overall its a decent phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm over OS Pocket PC
Palm customer support is useless still and as others have mentioned the lack of a standard MiniUSB connector is simply inexcusable
Still Im much happier with PalmOS Pocket over PC
As I use it I see that the battery doesnt seem to last very just long over 2 hours of talktime at the most
I hesitantly call Palm support and some get flunkie again I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their support
Im just going buy to a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged
I hate the idea of making such a compromise but for its me the lesser of two evils
The fact that Palm would release a phone with such battery terrible life is indicative of their customer mindset
As clunky as my Windows MDA was its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times the what Treo gives me even though the MDA has a much bigger screen
IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains The original Handspring Treo was designed by good when people Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo
Most of the better designed smartphones on the market Samsung Motorola HTC Wizard are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has its used clout to take over the market
I just wish other manufacturers offered PalmOS based smartphones again this way youd get the intuitive interface of Palm having without to be limited to Palms poorly designed hardware
maybe its time I finally the give Blackberry a try
I love the way the phone looks and feels but thats it about
From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone Ive owned ever
Ive had it now for 3 months and frustration my level continues to rise
First let me say that I really to wanted like this device
I had patience and understanding for a while but it got nowhere me
main The issue with this phone is its operating system Windows Mobile 5
Simple things that should take a click or two have become so difficult to that access you basically just give up
Connectivity with TMobile is horrible accessing the aim function work doesnt 9 times out of 10
I tried finding a solution for hours and the I best got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that
Internet explorer can NEVER find the page that Im looking for and consistently tells me to again try
Let me tell you also that this does device not let you choose between wifi and edge
If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE it then will continue to use EDGE unless you restart the phone with wifi enabled
Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smash phone the on a daily basis
Usually I would press to talk dial a call and it would immediately say Call Ended
Also when answering a call well trying to answer a call it would drop it as soon as pressed I talk
What the HELL is THAT good What is a phone if you cant make or receive calls Keep in mind this happens around half the time
Also keep in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY My calls should not be dropping except for when Im in subway the
The side volume is button extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation
Not only that but when you disable you it have no other method of changing the volume on the device
While the is keyboard basically easy to type on the phone is buggy
First off the t9 sucks It will completely change the word you are typing a to word thats in its dictionary while youre typing EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING Now get this you cant even permanently keep the t9 off
So you have to keep going into the menu to change it normal to ABC mode
While I appreciate the ability to have faster typing isnt the whole point of a QWERTY being able to type without using t9 When you actually get to typing the sometimes keys will stick and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it
This isnt a physical keyboard issue but another yet software issue
For all you techno oriented people there out basically everyone buying this phone the programs this device has available for download are minuscule
Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a JAVA program which most programs are coded in the Dashs JAVA will program not allow you to open those programs
I ALWAYS get an error A stating Java midlet is not responding It then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app
I could go on and on about its but issues I really dont care to
While Tmobile support customer is very helpful and friendly their servicecoverage is nonexistent
Calls are constantly dropped I get voice mails without the even phone ringing and internet connectivity is never really available
Please do a yourself favor and wait for the iPhone
In summary Microsofts software and TMobiles service have ruined a brilliant design although with a couple of flaws HTC from
are There many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to
I will break down it to Hardware Software and Cell Phone Service Provider
lot A has been written about this aspect of the device so Ill keep this to a minimum The best form factor Ive ever seen
This device provides you the power of a Blackberry the without bulky hardware so I can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster
A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth WiFi and quadband connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset cruise pages web and have access to email when in the US or Europe
The keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for sized medium emails
The battery life is great when WiFi is not enabled and when adequate it is
Standby management power appears to be excellent
The display while a little small is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to given use its size
The camera is pretty good and its been really great emailing photos people to as Im traveling around
After of all the cons that youll read below youll wonder why I ever bought the device and why I still use it
TMobile locked me into 2 a year contract on a very expensive device
It has great hardware that I can use in US the and Europe Im just hoping that Microsoft will finally get it right
The touch sensitive volume button is the most feature illconceived Ive ever seen
Even after playing around with various settings is it still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level
Even worse when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control and randomly the change volume
The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not enough beefy for the software that is loaded onto the device
the However blame could well be laid at Microsofts door for writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications
Either way performance is very slow for some basic functions see and below Im afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor
When a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to and take which call to put on hold or dropignore
On occasions the this problem has occurred with me the call that is droppedkept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed
When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked if the user depresses green the phone key the call is dropped
If the user presses anything other the than answer key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I have depressed the answer key
The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can used be
Even worse upon selection the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds open to
Now I have what some would call a large database of contacts but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model excuse this does not wash
The user interface for entering a new contact rudimentary is as are all dialog windows on this device
of One the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock
The user interface looks like it was in written 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness
The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more use intuitive model and was more thoroughly debugged
First of all the user only to gets select a time and if the alarm is on or off
From interface the you would assume you could only set a single alarm
The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example I set the alarm for 6am the next day the alarm goes off 6am at
day That I set the alarm for 7am the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am
The next day I set the alarm for 730am and you guessed it the now alarm goes off three times
The best that Ive been able to deduce of course this type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device is that the user has to actively select off for the current setting before setting on for the time new
But there is no indication of what alarms are set so after a while or a particularly busy week you loose can track of whats set and what isnt
the way only to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard reboot
If this took engineer an 10 minutes to write they should be fired
calculator A watch in the 80s had more sophisticated features
user The interface is so bad its hard to describe it in words
Microsoft truly does understand not how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that theyve inflicted upon us since Windows 95
Most features or function have to be through navigated the Start menu button
Applications are and nested features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections
Some features are simply hard to find but should it really take so many menu selections find to common tools or applications
The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous to put the device in Silent mode but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your to alarm wake you up for example does not work
Calendar reminders will be active as they are the assigned alarm property instead of their own or the notification property
only The way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events
So on my phone Nokia a thousand years ago when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I needed once landed
The phone would then automatically connect the to provider available
It wasnt completely automatic but the user interaction was simple intuitive and
First of all TMobile doesnt help by keeping a radio button on online your account that you have to select to enable international roaming
The feature free is so why not add a selection anyway All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone wont connect to the local network no matter what you do
Now assuming that you worked this out are you now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local providers network
On my Blackberry this was automatic but of course with Microsoft there are selections to make searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider choice of
ActiveSync This is the most annoying piece software of in that it just does not work
Worse still when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has and occurred some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization
It does not provide you with a fix a or hint a path so that you dont lose data
It does not even tell you the data was that lost
So Im using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft and Outlook they cant get that right OK it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft but come on
This was another primary purchasing for driver me
I am very and busy want to have my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA all the time
I thought that with the same provider of all the software Id OK be
Also as this feature has been for around over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry
are There probably annoying nits that I have with the software but those are the major ones
TMobile is useful to for me traveling in Europe
They have much better coverage over there than in the US Im where actually paying
Im in San Francisco and I have dead in spots my house
Their backend connectivity with your providers email is terribly buggy
At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connection and cant emails be accessed
But you know theres nothing wrong with your connection because youve been on browser the
Also there was a whole day that were emails not accessible
Because of the issues many that Id had with email set up and maintaining a connection I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed
When I finally called technical support they told that me their service was down no apology no notification no nothing
no Certainly minutes to make up for the inconvenience
So why didnt call I technical support earlier read below
I collectively have wasted over 12 hours of my life on their help line
Im not going go to into details as it would just take too long
Bottom line if you have a problem with your phone say Dash at the and prompt then ask for Tier Three Data support
Everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians encounter youll have inadequate training
If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial DO NOT DO IT This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that the understands device
So should buy you it Wait until Windows Mobile 6
Maybe another provider pick will up the device by that time
After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time tmobile continually wanted to blame me you did put it in fluorescent light did you put it in the sun did you drop it did you put it in your pocket and bend it did you put it in your pocket and bump into something did you drop it did you break it did you do something bad to it they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money
The most amusing part of the conversation went like this would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day will which cost 15 When I responded that the ground would be fine she said OK that will be 9
Due the lower price of charge the I decide to buy it but it doesnt work on my Sony Ericson w300i at all bad inversio
ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN100 METROS DE ALCANCE Y SOLO PALABRAS NO SIRVE NO LA DEBUELVO PORQUE ME SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO LO DE QUE CUESTA ESTA PORQUERI
The external antenna is a plastic only decoration and does not do anything functional
Poor construction software that is to difficult install unable to run when installed and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy
I encourage many to stay away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra money on a better dongle usb
As soon as i got this thing out its of package i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction
main The problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is oknot the 100 meters that it claims as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes
This was item an absolute waste of money and Im all the more irritated for having purchased it
Upon attempting to merely the insert device the outer case of the dongle split open
What I discovered That cute little antenna doesnt actually connect anything to Its just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side
When I finally managed to the get damn thing running the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pairconnect a device it worked fine once
I turned my off laptop removed the dongle and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all
Shell out the extra bucks 152030 or whatever and get a decent 2
I am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to up set
Instead I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was plugandplay truely
The product works but software the that claims to be windows compatible says it is not when installing
They send it with door another for the backside because your current door wont fit over this huge battery
is It frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry and Amazon would foist this product on us
The battery is so big that the device will longer no fit into your BlackBerry holster
Every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the card memory
The KRZR is a cool really looking phone but it has 2 huge issues a very short battery life 1 day and sllloooowwww reaction time push the menu key and WAIT for it to come up
After reading numerous the positive reviews for this phone I purchased
Here are the main issues I have found with this phone 1 The buttons too are small particularly the main control button
You have to used side the of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time
2 you If have quite a few contacts in your phone you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact
You will notice if that you are not careful you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly so if this is you be aware
3 You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have a missed call or have a message
VERY INCONVENIENT There is no to indication show this on the top screen only the inside screen
4 On occasion the display on the outside of the stops phone working entirely
What you just need to do is power the phone down they and back up again
Not optimal and I probably just got a bad phone but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent so I can then deal with likely the nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola
NOTE I have no personal vendetta against Motorola but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I into bought before purchasing
Currntly the Motoral software has a and glitch you cant assign specifice ring tones to phone number
text messaging is difficult becaust keys the are hard to see and too small
back The panel display is too small and hard to read
I have the the camera fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard
The reason i got was it to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public
It worked on my 9200 dell laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub
Dont you find that strange Aside from that it did also not work with my sony ericsson phone cant remember the model
This headset has a major flaw the connections the between headset and phone are full of static
The other parties dont hear it but their voice is constantly zapped by the static and Im asking them to themselves repeat
Ive compared with it a couple other headsets Ive got and they dont have this problem in the same locations
Actually this headset has static problems ANYWHERE office car walking out you name it
Ive used the headset for little a over a year and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the sound quality
Not being connected when calls came in a was major annoyance
Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed thatsince it was over the one year warranty my only option would be to purchase a new headset a huge to price pay for a piece that costs pennies
Logitechs for concern its customers appears to be nonexistant
I originally purchased the Mobile Logitech Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller
I with agree others that after 3045 minutes it feels like your ear is in a vise
People say they can hear me fine just and I can hear them just fine
But it also disconnects my with cell phone when it is not in use
What good is that Then when the phone I rings dont hear it
This headset is uncomfortable wear to but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine
You can also go to an store eyewear and have them do it for you
I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear just them fine also
The volume is great and at times I have to turn down it in volume
Have the tried AnycomHS890 and this outperforms it hands down
had Have it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time
I would definitely reccommend this headset to anyone in a environment noisy
Tried to change the rating and seems like cant do that once the review written is
then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first and unit snapped in two places on the second
When this happens youre perfectly operating earpiece a becomes bad piece of geek jewlery
its While perfmance was good before the break the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of memory titanum or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste battery contains lithium I bet Skip by this one if youre smart
I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone Unlockeda ago month
I was hoping get to the color that I saw on the web page
The phone that I received was mauve but different a one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site
The mauve phone I that got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised
At nightin the lighting at night the top part the of phonethe part that flips open and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray
Needless to say I spoke to service customer and sent the phone back for an exchange
The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again so for the 2nd time returned I it and got my money refunded
I gave 1 star due the to customer service provided but again they could not help me
If you are ready to so spend much on this phone its because of the brand and the color which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page
Incidentally this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it pink but Amazon calls it mauvethough the phone and the image shown do match not
So stay away from ordering this pretty phone mauve
all you will get loads is of disappointment with your time being wasted
I have never met anybody that has earholes big enough for these I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ear That didnt work so now I have a wire that plugs my into phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound talk sitting in the seat next to me
I dont about know you folks but I have small ears
Though the on sound these ear buds are good I cant keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because theyre too big for me and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears
Unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of cords orphaned
This product stopped working after about a week two or
lesson learned buy OEM products instead of knockoff cheap
I purchased this headset on and 1232007 received it on 1252007
However the RebatesHQ site was not on functioning 1252007
When it works the day next it can not locate the offer number nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture
If you click on the URL link supplied by Amazon Rebate form you will be able to find the offer by Amazon order number however they will disconnect you in next the step saying session expired
Its a shame for Amazon to squeeze the penny last out of its customers
I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone which I but love this case is to snug for it
slider The phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out
Its a cute case I love would to use if it was just a little larger
I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked nice so when I got it
I bought this item at the end of January and received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges are turning all white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to order another color and see if it does the same
They have the M610 listed so I took a chance it but will not charge the phone
00 50 of the price sprint however Sprint is out of stock right now
I am sure it is a great cable but it not does work for Apple computers
Samsung not does have a driver that supports the cable and a mac
The company I ordered the cable from great is easy to work with but once again it does not work on a mac
I have repeated that it does not work on a mac multiple times I because want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac
It did not my fit phone and I was forced to go out and but another one
I bought these adaptors to use regular head phones 3mm with my phone cell mp3 LG cu500 player
Once you plug the headset 3mm into this adaptor you loose stereo sound
It makes it impossible to a use regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone
I have tried 3 stereo cell phone and headsets they all have poor sound quality especially the base level
They all have some type of flaw the volume wont get loud enough cord to short poor etc sound
The other works but with a of lot loss of sound quality
If you push the headphone jackmale all the way in to the adapter sound cutoff is on one speaker
You have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes both from speakers
I would return this product if i thought it was worth my time effort and
5 mm jack is slightly too small creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using when it doing anything active
I tried adapters both i bought the 2pack in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose
The adapter did not work when plugged in to a m500 samsung
The sound only came out of ear one when plugged in
The color of the I product received is nothing like the picture If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you
I this bought exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges
Doh This crappy case within broke 3 weeks of use
only I took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did
The little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after this only short time
Do not buy this POS unless you want to your throw money out
Also notice that this is not a Samsung part OEM
If you call to for ask tech support from Samsung they will tell you they cant help you
The only positive thing I to have say is that getting a refund was fairly painless
I go suckered in to buying and this was really exited waiting on it
had You to have the product license number which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy
my advvice to you is not to buy this product but you if want to chance it you may be lucky
Cool Concept and but everything when I tried to install the driver my CDRom drive wouldnt even pick up that little CD
Bought this because Logitech has a great with reputation other products
I used this for a short period to due it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough
I actually went back to a Jabra wired unit until recently when I a purchased Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable has good battery life and the sound is better
One never keeps its charge pretty much from the I time bought it
the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break anytime off
The sound quality on my end is good my but friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic
Also its big and heavy compared to the motorola own I
Good sound nd price nicely connect with mobile however NOT WORK at all with my PC MAC neither
Once its connected with my moble they refuse to get in touch with PC any
they dont connect with 2 diveces in same its time OK but even if turn off my mobile nd renew all profile still its not changing
Connection No with MY PC so I was expecting use this for my Skype but NO WAY
The sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable electrical terrific engineering poor mechanical engineering
wind Even didnt seem to bother the headset much
The voice quality was great transmission on and reception
But the earpiece incredibly is flimsy and cant be replaced
The second time it broke I could have gotten a free again replacement but I didnt want the hassle
I have a Scala now that Ive been using for months and Im very happy with it even though the sound windimmunity and doesnt measure up to the Logitech
Although this product very is nice I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect
To me the words charge all at once means that I can charge all the with devices only one cord that plugs into the wall
This item is a simply method for organizing you devices
Although it a is nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34
99 I paid and if it wasnt a gift and Christmas 3 wasnt
I feel that by using the words charge at all once they are purposely misleading the customer
In the ad this charger cable claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo
It will charge but I already have a home and a car so charger it serves me no purpose
My concern was always whether was Amazon up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans
I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this site indicating the Pearl shipped hot with an active SIM which meant for those that like me were vs upgrading
new service their existing phone would stop working while the new was phone en route
To be fair that did NOT however happen I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept
The instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the SIM turn on phone the and it will work
And if it work doesnt it says dont call Cingular call Amazon
I followed the instructions phone didnt work I called Amazon at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and would someone be contacting me in 48 HOURS
I told him what I truly believe which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have wait to 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone which is supposed to work out of the box isnt working
On a positive note I immediately called Cingular and they resolved the problem me for on the spot SIM was not activated in the system
Ive purchased this car charger for my Treo the and
connector that was suppose to go into my 650 Treo did
not fit too big I so wasnt able to connect it and
when it arrived the cable not did list my phone model number and the software listed all other models
and it never worked even messed up my a phone little
Too many options and I spent 2 hours trying figure to it out
I this bought product for my cell wich was listed on their description and it so happens that the software will not work they did not sent the drivers I would not do business with this people again
this has not only been a waiste of money also but a waiste of time
Amazon should not permit them take peoples money that like
Junk Sent with a CD that had USB a driver but wouldnt work on two different computers
Contacted the Bargaincell shipper but their only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed
The email stated emphatically that they dont support provide for the product
I bought this product to download pictures my from cell phone onto the computer
The description stated it that would work for my selected model phone however it does NOT The software needed to download the pictures is not correct
When we called the customer services they were of no help they had no idea what to say do or to correct the problem
Apparently I am not the only person to have this problem with product the
Again cell the phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate
This product is the worst of its kind It lasted a couple of months at the most it is not at all worth the no price matter how cheap
I picked one up at for WalMart ten bucks that works great dont waste your time on this one
It is cheap dont but be had stay away from this product
It fell in the toilet though and they didnt sell anymore them at the Virgin webstore so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store
It is awful with the poor quality sound short battery life horrible ringtones and worst of all I was unable to ever retrieve my voicemail Hello and it has the most horrible graphics
Does anyone want buy to it along with all the accessories It is barely used
So I looked on Ebay and found a used and 8500 bid on it won it and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610
I like the 8500s microsize ringtones simplicity animated graphics etc
I must be careful to not lose it or drop it in the toilet again though
My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one but I get cannot another replacement as I bought this one used
The pay as you go works fine for me as I do not want to a have cell phone clued to my head
I use it check to my land line for messages and for brief calls
This review is more about Mobil Virgin customer service than the phone
I ordered a VOX on 8610 1222007 online thru Virgin Mobile
I called customer service and explained problem the
I replied that I could not if tell it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a new kit
I a received phone but not a charger and it also wouldnt charge
I called customer service and the explained issue and it must be the charger at fault
The rep said they would not a send new charger that I would have to purchase one
I said this didnt make any sense according to the offer I could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean to that get a new phone and charge I need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to get a charger The support rep said yes and that I had to make up my mind either return the phone or purchase a charger
The customer support rep kept going off to line talk to someone but refused or couldnt get a supervisor to talk to me
When I said I didnt know what an ESN number she indignantly explained that was it like a serial number on the back of the
Im not clear why she needed this since I havent activated the phone and I already the referenced order vmu number
At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile and at least she was trying to track down some info or so I thought she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldnt handle my order that would I have to call back
I called back had to work my way thru the answering and system got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike
Mike explained that they couldnt send a none charger in stock and that I would have to send the entire phone back which is what I am now doing 60 minutes after the initial call
I have to say that my interactions with virgin mobile so has far not been positive
They customer service staff is obviously poorly trained and not to empowered make decisions
The interfaces with support are youth not geared a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally
I am sending the phone back for a refund and the reconsidering provider for payasyougo service
I replaced a that Kyocera I disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems
The menus are very poorly designed are they difficult to navigate and its hard to do anything
The ringer speaker is inside the phone so when its its closed almost impossible to hear
I usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on I hate this and phone will be replacing it soon
I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera suddenly Slider died on me conveniently 3 months after VMs warranty was up and i had just purchased a 20 phone card had airtime credits which were not refundable
Now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive treatment harsh
My kyocera slider looked actually like new when it died with no scratches whatsoever so i was pretty upset
After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it pretty was clear they werent going to do anything to help
Obviously I didnt want the same one that could possibly die on after me a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610
By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN when i called to activate the phonethey have the nerve to tell me that I couldve purchased the 8610 same from them at a discount price of 24
The fng idiotsHELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONERand after i spent tax 50
the ringer is indeed as low others have reported here
Its so low that if its in my purse i cant even hear it WTF Also the battery life no sucks sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half
It also doesnt good get service with the VMSprint network my slider had xcellent service wit despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls
So Ive had it 5 days and Im considering attempting to bring back it where I purchased it from
However i dont want to buy an expensive phone from because VM Im seriously reconsidering continuing wthem
The way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of they phones sell they are expensive
I am a lite user but if you talk more slightly than usual you end up feeling it wallet wise
Prior to these I issues was a happy VM customer but not anymore
phone The may be fine but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile service never really worked
Perhaps was it the phones fault I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account
I had to file 4 investigations because they would close them resolving without the issue or they were not filled out right
I spent hours the on phone with them and never had the problem fixed
Now I have away thrown a bunch of money for crappy service
I plan to just run out minutes the and then disconnect the phone
I went with the TMobile Sidekick already and am way happier
This phone could possibly quite be the biggest piece of technology crap
useless Its the software on it is very cheap and childish
Not professional at all the camera is pitiful and the keys are small too for anyone who doesnt have 10yr old hands
Just because it has a qwerty keyboard that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is waste a of cash
Purchase a different phone one this is not worth it
Bought a cell phone from battery this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a phone cell battery last longer than a month They refuse to refund or replace
They are a shady company and Ill do never business with them again and will warn others to do the same
Coming from the Blackberry 8700c this phone is big a disappointment
Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and stuck Im with it
All I can do is whine on Internet the so here it goes
Use the extended battery throw away the one standard
The keys are small too the 5way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally
Why do applications not quit when end you them Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager
The menu is preloaded with goodies to buy from how Cingular convenient
Grade C if you bother learn to the shortcut keys
HELLO This is suppose to be an player MP3 right Somebody explain to me why this is OK
The phone works reception great is great speakerphone is great
Outlook This email is workable but difficult
can You write an email you can edit your schedule and tasks but its not easy
If Blackberry gets and A and it does Blackjack a gets C
It doesnt synch notes so if youre an Outlook Notes person youre just out left sorry
The camera seems to work fine although may I use it twice per year
In short if you really want to get work done on your phone a get Blackberry
If you want phone a that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice this could be the one for you
After owning 3 Blackberrys over the years I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability add to memory
Compared to the Blackberry the Microsoft operating system very is cumbersome for me and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially
On the plus side the Blackjack has good battery life the screen is excellent and it has the best reception ever Ive experienced
The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of use moderate the ink ie the numbers began wearing off the keys
Its to the now point where the phone is pretty much unusable especially when its backlit
I called Cingular who first passed me on the Samsung where after 2 hours on the phone I was told that my only option was to send the phone my primary source of communication to their service center and wait 3 weeks
To my surprise they on went to say that at their discretion they might also charge me for the repair
Ive read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were but exaggerating now that Ive encountered this I do feel its worth considering
If thinking youre about a Blackjack I encourage you to be aware that for one the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys and that you may well be on your own when it comes to service
I feel that its reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and not if the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right
You have to repeatedly tug this at thing to get it to retract
The is wire very thin so Im thinking it will not last long
I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and nice its to have one charging while Im using the otheryou dont have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone
So also I bought one of Boxwaves batteries for the 8525
Well the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine but it refuses charge to the battery that came with my 8525
This really limits its usability an as offline charging device
The cradle itself into plugs the USB port on the phone which was not designed with cradling in mind so its not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle
Since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone whos idea that was anyway it almost always gets pressed while Im wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle
This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the station docking
Anyway just my opinion but its actually easier to connect the standard USB charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle so Id recommend save your money just and sticking with the standard USB charger
If you want really to do all charging offline you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one
I ordered 2 those of which never received and seller never replies emails
This case actually scratches and destroys pearl your
The inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in cheap a way that destroys your phone
When I first received the items they work didnt and them I returned and had to spend more money and they still dont work
I even had the computer specialist at work try and they couldnt even get them work to
I sent them a email to my receive money back because I didnt want to keep spending money to send items back that dont work back
I will never buy any from you again will and inform others to beware
Im afraid the phone will fall off any second if I it use
After hours upon hours of trying to this get cable and software to work It eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time and then never worked again
The extra moneys worth paying to avoid headache the
What a waste of 20 bucks The skin hinders the functionality cameras
A very portion small of the FlexiSkin blocks the camera lens thereby messing up the photos
I had to trim a portion of the skin away order in to take unobstructed pictures
Next it makes your otherwise superpimp phone look a like bulky piece of junk more akin to a ZachMorris style Nokia from 1993
Additionally The FlexiSkin actually TRAPS dust and other particles the between skin and the phone
This item blows in both functionality aesthetics and dont waste you money
First time when I plugged in the cell phone displayed error message that Error Charging remove immediately
I ordered this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my Cingular new 8125 phone
I was so happy to the see package to arrive since using my finger or a pen is not an optimal way to work with this device
Sadly these replacement parts do not match the specifications factory
These styluses do fit not into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out further than the manufacturer designed
This makes it for easy the stylus to fall out and does not create a smooth and clean design look for the phone with the replacement installed
If you are about particular these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not the match picture that was advertised
I disappointed am with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
If you are particular about these things you not will be satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not match the that picture was advertised
I am disapointed with purchase this and am looking for a better replacement stylus
The item did not with work my Tmobile MDA except in one ear bud
This has all of the features of the headset that came with my and phone it was much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from Tmobile
Brand new and I had to jiggle the cable near plug the to get it to work
In order to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart which could have broken wires the if I werent careful and may tear further through wearing it
The mike is symmetrically located from both earpieces this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple
There are several places which Im worried will break soon normal through wear and tear
The ear pieces are hard plastic and like look theyll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time
The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first was place to listen to music
Also be warned that shipping was listed as 5 for a item 7 when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 23 stamps
The is cable barely 3 feet long from mike to plug so I dont recommend it for tall people
It will do until I can find better but thats best the I can sa
No driver was and included no drivers are available online for this
None of the drivers that with came the package worked either
As for their return policy after a couple email exchanges just they sent me an address they did not comment on paying for shipping or giving me any compensation
I dont want to wrap something up that I already paid shipping for when it was already inexpensive an item
i didnt got the car charger i actually bought sent they a regular one im not even using it
It a has samsung logo but it looks fake after I bought it
The belt tore clipper of the phone holder with no reason
This product had a rubberpetroleum strong smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
I guess you get what you pay for so I wasnt totally that surprised the battery didnt work
What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a PART what of I paid for it
Dont do business these with guys and dont buy this battery
I cant complain about shipping it really was fast
The 2nd time i plug it in the metal piece that plugs into the phone jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding it making a freakin weight paper
I ordered before brent review birckheads came up and I got taken
The correct internal dimension 4 is x 1 34 x 0
5 not clearly a size that the VX9900 can fit into
Considering that the seller enters the product dimensions as 4 ounces instead of the measurments one might suspect that this may not be an mistake honest
I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers out fill the description properly
All I want is a cable sync to my phone and update software
Half of the time the computer fails to the recognize phone is connected
A brand motorola dataonly cable works just fine
I was warned not to invest in cables cheap and I wish I would have listened
The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline you incase nuke your phone and need to reload drivers
Problem is the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connectingdisconnecting as above mentioned
This cord 10 30 for cord moto when you realize its junk
I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the Palm original Pilot and have loved them I think I had three different models over the years
I wanted a smart phone so I could check my email so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm and product so I could stay with my current mobile provider Cingular
Now I am counting days the until my 2 year commitment ends so I can punt this awful awful product
I may even bite the bullet and pay off my commitment early just so I can get rid it of
You must remember to this stick in a charger whenever you can
If you forget and leave it in your pocket overnight then it be will dead the next day
I have turned off every thing I can find sucks that power and it still drains amazingly fast
It wont last even a day if you make very many calls
Ive had a phone Cingular for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of So
With this phone I think you have to be right underneath an antenna to a get signal
I was on a conference call yesterday and dropped got twice
I am envious everytime I get in an with elevator someone who can talk on their cell phone because mine will freeze up any time I try that
The only way I have found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery and let it a do hard reboot
versa The mail program that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with
You must leave your work computer to on check the corporate mail
That means if I am traveling with my the computer phones corporate mail program will not work
I dont think the browser that comes with the phone will work with Java so I cannot check my Yahoo either mail
I tried going back and forth to the preJava version Yahoo of and that is too much of a pain
I havent been ever able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software something that never happened when I upgraded before
It is hard to use on line so guess I I need to bite the bullet and print out the whole thing and then take a week of vacation to read it and see if I can make any of these neat functions that I read about work
Hardly a week goes by that I dont actively think how much I this hate phone
I actually signed on to Amazon today just to write this because the phone wasnt working today properly
Palm could not resolve the all issues associated with Treo
I bought this few phone days back and it freezes frequently
Ive had the same problem other users are having with the losing and signal never finding it again with Cingular
Ive gone through 4 phones the same thing and over over
Never did they or I put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD card although right now its working and the card is not it in go figure
So I guess the options are not download things but have the phone work or download things my onto SD card and not have a phone
A slight warpage of back piece of my plastic made case
You wont know if your case will fit until try you to put it on
I have a 650 with a cell number that has been me with for over 10 years
Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price I thought my fulfilled contract I on am month to month now meant I could qualify for a new account and keep my number
After wasting a few hours with dealing Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly I had to return it
It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 customer year I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750
It shipped via FEDEX on 32907 to my office with an indicated of delivery 3207
The package sat the on FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for
This was after Id already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late arriving in
FEDEXs response for sitting it three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded
For the 100 difference price in it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store
battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of time the
The product was sent a with plastic bag no manual not anything only the base and tha ac charger wall
When I tried it s working not neither the cradle neither the aditional battery charger
got I rid of the bulky i355s at the end of our contract and bought two of these for our account
We had to return the first phone line1 within days of getting it as it would randomly shut off crash and other times the volume would fluctuate on own its
Exchanging was it an ordeal with Sprint they charged me for the replacement phone and still havent credited my account after two billing cycles
A few later months and now the second phone line2 is crashing
Other times it will shut off in the of middle the call
The other night I went to charge it and it said battery invalid so I took the battery out and put it back in
I might go back to the i355 it rugged was reliable but large phone
I guess Ill have to haggle with Motorola getting about this one fixedreplaced
How hard can it be shipped cell a phone carrying case instead of a charger
I one owned of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someone with problems no
It has far better sound quality than my backup which is a Jabra with boom no
The ear volume is adjustable on my phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers that have wont let them adjust the volume
As noted by another reviewer this headset does not come with any buttons or switches the thing only on the cord is a shirt clip
6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive ever only used one
The headset is very easy to slip into my ear only takes second 1 and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sore
My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use gels ear
If you regularly stay on the phone longer 2 than hours its something to keep in mind
However it suits my needs just fine and for the low price I think its a really great buy
The sound is great and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer others than
The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear this a is first and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them
device The works fine and I dont feel I over paid
Sure there are better hands free devices out but there this one is reliable
My perception is that the headset very is confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine
I higly recommend it the over other types of headset
i helped develop the danger aka hiptop tmobile sidekick and hated holding its bricklike nature to my head
the only problem is i hate earbuds so i wasnt looking forward shopping to forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics store and abusing their return policy bought one of every headset they to had try 23 headsets to be exact
picked i up the jabra only to be a completeist figuring there was no way id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear styling
but after trying them all the jabra was easily the best and feeling best fitting
in a nutshell here are the things i like about unit this in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the right and the left so you get a chance to a get much closer fit than some generic ear piece
contrary to what others have said here the ear pieces stay very snug in your ear they if dont youre not fitting them correctly
wear i glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
i like having the model with the microphone boom over the earonly classic jabra because it
lets people know talking youre on the phone and less likely to interrupt you while youre talking
i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with top the down and be heard without a ton of wind noise
its small and easy to wrap up into my case cell
also in the newest version theyve adding a securing lip the to rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
i called their 800 number when securing my clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a ball point pen for my troubles
using one with my hiptop is a joy it means i can still contruct smss type in emails add messages and addresses to my address book talking whilst on the phone
if you have a data device of any kind this will make your experience phone twice as good
a truly great product from a company that knows how treat to its customers right
granted Ive only used one other it was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that in one sound quality and comfort
Where my friends would fall out of my ear this one I once got it figured out never comes loose
Second listening to people on my friends I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can turn actually down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear moreso than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had complaints no from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shaped as you can see in picture the and there are six of them total three of them for each ear
Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear while gels others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that would I turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could I tried holding it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeat purpose the of having a handsfree earpiece
I was of thinking throwing it into traffic on I95
And then one day somehow I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear with the little pokyout part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top of your ear if you do that just itll pop out again and then voila it stays put
Matter fact o itll stay put so well that itll be a little bit difficult even painful to get out again
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patience levels and lower IQs might have different than experiences my own
But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out was I golden
I love this thing and almost never talk on phone the without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly before youre good and practiced at it which may not sound like a lot but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hear the first sentence say they or whatever
like But all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat
In fact I find this earpiece to be comfortable so that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or something
The other complaint that I saw on here that was its not compatible with Nokia phones
In fact it even says right on package the that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I have a Nokia 3589i and it works fine just
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone both of which claim to be Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt with work all Nokia phones
While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didnt include mine it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my model the 3590 which piqued curiosity my
And so I went to the friendly manager of the store I that was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them
The strange part of it was that we couldnt see a visible difference in two the units
and then one us of noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to either know your phone well as in the have little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to take it down a notch for an extended period getting of used to it and for confusing packaging
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any from sound the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end
And living in windy Providence this is a bit an of annoyance
Also for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldnt hear person the on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
for Now some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Im not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or EarBoom the
Either its way something buyers should be aware of
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost yeah but Amazon thats not why Im writing this review
Id like to talk about performance the and comfort of the Earboom
The eargel thingies are designed quite of well the three different sizes for each ear youre bound to find one that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt find that any fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side
My wife had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more ears symmetrical I hate jogging so cant comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed
Id have to imagine itd take a big hit to it knock loose once in place
Sound quality from the earbud is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks some especially fidelity the higher frequencies
Normally this is not a problem but it can sometimes the make person youre talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows to you tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse without having the voices washed over with background noise
The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an while ambulance driving
There is a small slot on the gels funnels that some external noise to your drum while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths
Ive asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive my voice comes through loud and clear despite the booms apparent lack of length reinforcing my belief that size matter DOESNT
In fact I have found the mic to be very to sensitive even small sounds
Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing the on keyboard our mouse click surfing theyll hear every click
Another example I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids in playing the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Even while driving they could hear when shifted I gears
Not that its obtrusive to the other person on the its phone just good to be aware they can hear it all
Form Fit and Function are all there I and would recommend this product
In fact just I ordered another it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in letterswithin BOLD the titleit says quotUniversal 2
Know your and phone your aquisition before giving a bad review
Ive been my using T809 since January and mostly love it
1 There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the lens screen
Ive read that people other have this problem too
2 I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset they wont stay in my ears and because you cant hear the phone over ring the headset while listening to music
3 The ring starts off softly builds and to a louder volume
If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings too quiet and by the time I realize Im getting a call and fumble to get it out of my Ive pocket usually missed the call
This sucks and I dont think a theres setting to disable this feature
But Ill probably look for something similar but after better my contract expires
BTW you if get insurance thru TMobile for any phone make sure you see it on the bill
I had a problem with water damage weeks three after buying
TMobile claimed I never asked for but insurance fortunately Amazon exchanged it
Ive always stayed away from the flipslider phones Im because good at breaking things
Ive had this one for almost six months and still its going strong
You can check all the specs online and in posts other
The one I got phone my will slip out of it once in a while
If you have BMW a and want to bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook my up new phone to my new BMW
I just picked up one these of for my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your you ear can feel that you are wearing it
If you make lot a of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset
if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking this at silly thing dont bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesnt have a chord
Are you kidding me Were going to set up an EarGel Will Xchange this be domestic the Americas or are we going EnterGnashinAll with this PUPPY
Ok Ill do web the site were going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one
Anyone know a Fortune CEO 500 we can bring into the picture Distribution is going to be biggest problem here Im thinking we dont give UPS a look lets hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates
Its gamble but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those Gels Johnny come lately from jumping into arena
Ill go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community Ive got a 5 year nocompete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my bs over this they want 9 of the gross revenue ad from www
com but after we secure the venture Ill capital tell those jokers to take a hike
Allright lets get thing this moving folks great ideas have a shelflife and the clock is ticking
If knows anyone of one can you please post that information here
These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others say speaking in a grocery store
Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound but theyre great for listening to podcasts doing while the shopping
The only downside is they are bulky and do so not fit in any earbud holder while not in use
Taking the eargels off store to the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
My ears are a funny shape and I cant wear regular earbuds but I when add these gels they fit great and dont fall out
They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those soundisolating expensive earbuds
Sometimes I need a Small and sometimes I need a Medium depending on the the day weather and how long I use them
I gave the Large size to my boss and he loves them too so dont say you cant all use of the sizes guys
I do not need large the and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage
Tmobiles service may not be the best but I have had no problems with phone the itself
For all the people saying that it isnt magentaIt really is
The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pink pale the tmobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown
I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have shades different
Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos I LOATHE having to charge the battery Perhaps everyday I just got a bad battery but Ive NEVER had to charge any phone daily
If youre a shutterbug like me you love will this phone
I didnt even mention hot the pinkmagenta color which all gals love
One note of caution If live you in hurricane alley like me you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they dont take down the cell phone towers before the storm
It may be useless locally you but can at least tell your people youre still among the living and need money to escape the carnage
I have a TMobile Magenta Razr and for have the past 6 months
In fact when I had issues with my first one TMobile it replaced
This phone is of top the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology
I And love the color cause it sticks out everywhere
They should more make phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this
I personally mind dont the supposedly tedious software
Of I course will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone
It is so easy I figured it without out really picking up the manual
Overally I will continue to stick wTMobile and Motorola for as as long I keep needing a cellphone
I the purchased pink razr with Cingular service and couldnt be happier
I have had it for about month a and have had no problems at all
Tmobile is not a very service good in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
The device works and fine I dont feel I over paid
Sure there are better hands free devices out there this but one is reliable
My perception is that the headset very is confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine
I recommend higly it over the other types of headset
i helped develop the danger hiptop aka tmobile sidekick and hated holding its bricklike to nature my head
the only problem i is hate earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics store and abusing their return policy bought one of every headset they had to try 23 headsets to exact be
i picked up jabra the only to be a completeist figuring there was no way id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear styling
but trying after them all the jabra was easily the best feeling and best fitting
in a nutshell here are the things i like about this unit particular in
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the right and the left so you a get chance to get a much closer fit than some generic ear piece
to contrary what others have said here the ear pieces stay very snug in your ear if they dont youre not fitting them correctly
i wear so glasses i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic earonly jabra it because
lets people know youre talking on the phone and likely less to interrupt you while youre talking
i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard a without ton of wind noise
its small and easy wrap to up into my cell case
also in the newest version theyve a adding securing lip to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
i called their number 800 when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a ball point pen for my troubles
using with one my hiptop is a joy it means i can still contruct smss type in emails add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone
if you have a data device of any kind this will make your experience phone twice as good
a truly product great from a company that knows how to treat its customers right
granted Ive only used one it other was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort
Where my friends would fall out of my ear this one once I got it figured never out comes loose
Second listening to people on my friends I would have to turn up sound the to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear moreso than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking using to the Jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They oddly are shaped as you can see in the picture and there are six of them total three of them for each ear
Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear while gels others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this unit the kept earpiece falling out everytime that I would turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could I holding tried it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinking of throwing it traffic into on I95
And then one day somehow I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear with the pokyout little part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top of your ear if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
Matter o fact itll stay put so well that itll be a little bit difficult even to painful get out again
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patience levels and lower IQs might have different than experiences my own
But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out I golden was
I love this thing and never almost talk on the phone without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds get to in properly before youre good and practiced at it which may not sound like a lot but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hear the first sentence they say or whatever
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing beat a
In I fact find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or something
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with phones Nokia
In fact it even right says on the package that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I a have Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
They make two other models of EarBoom one which of clearly would not have worked with my phone both of which claim to be Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt work with all Nokia phones
browsing While at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didnt include mine it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my model the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and me let test both of them
The strange part of it was that we couldnt see a visible difference in the units two
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia had compatible three
So my advice is to either know phone your well as in have the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to it take down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging
Several months later the little piece of foam fallen has from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end
And living in Providence windy this is a bit of an annoyance
Also for a I while was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldnt hear the person on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
Now for some reason Im not having that anymore problem
Im not really sure the if problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom
Either way something its buyers should be aware of
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost Amazon yeah but thats not why Im writing this review
Id to like talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom
The thingies eargel are designed quite well of the three different sizes for each ear youre bound to find one that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt find any that fit my right ear comfortably extended for periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side
My wife had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comment on the fit that during activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed
have Id to imagine itd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place
Sound quality from the earbud is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks fidelity some especially the higher frequencies
Normally is this not a problem but it can sometimes make the person youre talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of frequencies high allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse without having the voices washed over with background noise
The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to on concentrate the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving
There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other noise stray paths
Ive asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive my voice comes through loud and clear despite the booms apparent lack of length reinforcing belief my that size DOESNT matter
In fact I have found the mic to be sensitive very to even small sounds
Forget talking on the and phone subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing theyll hear every click
Another example I was in house my and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Even driving while they could hear when I shifted gears
Not that its obtrusive to the other person the on phone its just good to be aware they can hear it all
Form Fit and Function are all there and I recommend would this product
In fact I just ordered another it makes a gift great
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have be to listed because very clearly in BOLD letterswithin the titleit says quotUniversal 2
your Know phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review
Ive been using T809 my since January and mostly love it
1 There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind screen the lens
Ive read that people other have this problem too
2 I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset they wont stay in my ears and because you cant hear the phone ring over the headset while to listening music
3 The ring starts off and softly builds to a louder volume
If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings too and quiet by the time I realize Im getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket Ive usually missed the call
This sucks and I dont think theres a setting to disable feature this
But Ill probably for look something similar but better after my contract expires
BTW if you get insurance thru TMobile any for phone make sure you see it on the bill
I had a problem water with damage three weeks after buying
claimed TMobile I never asked for insurance but fortunately Amazon exchanged it
Ive always stayed away from the flipslider phones Im because good at breaking things

If you have a BMW and to want bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to up hook my new phone to my new BMW
I owned one of these for about three months it then started to fall apart
can I be moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someone with no problems
It has far better quality sound than my backup which is a Jabra with no boom
The ear is volume adjustable on my phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont let them adjust the volume
As noted by another reviewer this headset does not come with any buttons or switches the only thing on the cord is a clip shirt
6 different gels ear are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
The headset is very to easy slip into my ear only takes 1 second and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sore
My boyfriend a reported similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 its hours something to keep in mind
However it suits my needs fine just and for the low price I think its really a great buy
The sound is and great the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
bud The actually sits comfortably in my ear this is a first and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them
I just picked up one of for these my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear can you feel that you are wearing it
If you make a lot of cell calls phone this is a very good ear headset

Tmobile is not a very good service in my and opinion that is why I chose Cingular
Sort of a metallic red with a touch soft rubber feel
Some of the soft touch is coming off at the with corners wear but its still red which is nice
I will probably another get color on it for spring
fit The is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different
Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola v3m razr
I have had this almost for 6 months and I like it a lot
Black leather blue piping going around edge the
The blue is that vivid color that one of those exoticexpensive fish tank fish have neons or tetras Whichever it is is it very sharp looking
It does not add much bulksizeweight to phone the
When I am taking a photo I simply unsnap the half that is on the flipup half of cell my phone which is where the camera lens is take the photo and slip it back on
Before I used to know this about I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way like a wayward lock of hair
out Turns that futzing with the strap is unnecessary
They designed it so you can just that remove half of the case take photos and snap it back on
In fact the reason the strap is there in the first place so is you can easily remove the other half
Look what is on the end that of strap before you curse it guys
Its snap a Snaps unsnap that is what they are for
It makes the phone easier much to grip in your hand
I can easily pivot it around in my hand it flip around pick it up and basically not expect it to skid around
Without the Glove have you a bare metal or plastic case
looking Smooth and well maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars
I think it is at the bottom not at the back the way some people have said but I cannot for remember certain
I know it goes off and easily on for me but has never come off on its own yet
The i860 is not much bigger than one those of little matchbox cars from the 1960s
With the glove on I know it is not probably going to get scratched too easily
Ive dropped it many times and this protected case it like I wanted
Having room for the extended battery is too great because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone
Was received in timely a manner however the picture online was not what I expected
For the price really I thought it was a little cheap looking in person
As it was a gift I was somewhat disappointed in quality the
This headseat is pretty neat when youre on the road or just relaxing work between
It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call also and controls the pauseplay and answerhangup features
The comfort of the ear budds could be a little better but the stereo sound great is
The area only of improvement would be the belt clip
I Really like this the phone camera quality the software everything is excellent
Unfortunately you could not use some of these features in U the
One thing I do understand not why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price
The phone 5 gets stars but the retailers price gets 2 stars
I keep will this short and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned
Its great taking for pictures the pictures come out so clear
Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model the photos are much better both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses but this 3 is
Also N73 the covers all radio bands making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere supposedly two internal antennae
The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular so depending the on city I was in I occasionally had very spotty coverage
The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90 and best of all it is much more compact than N90 the fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket
Last there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back the of phone protecting the camera lense why arent they all like this
As usual the flash isnt the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera but otherwise I see this phone the as best of both worlds
its 12 cents per minute which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid cost phones
Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when Im in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are what and they are doing
I dont use phones cell much but if I must have one I might as well have one that doesnt make me worry about another huge bill
For kids who think can they mangle the budget forget it cuz when the card is used up thats it kiddo
they Once use up the card the only number they can dial is 911 but thats it
Bonus features clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell when me to go home at the end of the day
At some point I might not be able to live this without
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very from different anything youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screen protectors are that very thin material that stick you on the screen hope against hope that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen on is the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors a are completely different animal
And because of those properties they go on with bubbles NO and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on good there
This is the state of the for art screen protectors
And this becomes all an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will get dulled and scratched
Because of the thickness and quality these of scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
I was completely satisfied with the phone clip purchased I
I HAD HAVE THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD UNDERSTAND TO
I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A CELL PREPAID PHONE PLAN
I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF PHONE YOUR
I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS ACTIVATE MOTOROLA IT ON
Ive been using this phone with the service Net10 since March and have to say I am very happy with it
I dont use a cell phone very often so this was the economical most way for me to go
Although the phone doesnt have all the bells whistles and like other phones have
Adding minutes easy is and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER
I averaged it less at than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare
I got better ringtones and online still waiting to see about wallpaper
OverallI would recommend this phone if you need dont more than 100 minutes per week
The service has been good and the features easy are to use
The only reason I give 4 stars is I because am not sure how long the phone will last
The flip part is little a weak but we will have to see
It was easy really to add minutes and you can do it right from your Net10 phone
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted just and what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt happier be
I used have this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less leather than cases etc
But thickness the gains you considerable protection
have I dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is to easy type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy press to
protective The skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and handling good
Only disadvantage is you that can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
was This custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one is complaint they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the and pictures thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons below just the screen
The button is layout the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for 700w the not the 700p
Im going to if see theres a way to remove these somehow
After buying the LG new Chocolate I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it
I searched the and Internet found this one to be the best value
When I first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as I opened the package put and my phone in it I could tell it was a perfect fit
I really like the clear window which I did not have on my previous case now I can see who is calling and my answer phone without having to take it out of the case every time
Wind noice no problem user friendly coustomer support for Cardo great is
My only complaint and consequently the 4star rating is that sometimes I dont hear the Blackberry feel or the vibration
Apart from that this holster is a vast over improvement the OEM plastic holster
I have had 2 Zire models and managed break to both screens
My dislike is that I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer fitting form
I have tried get to info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avail
As for the SD card issue I remedied that carfully by opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject
To keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo I drilled a hole the in back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes
The skin is very useful but can be on improved ways to put it on and take it off
Im not really gadget a guy and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up
When the company gave me a Treo 650 so I can stay in touch I needed to at least take of care the thing
Im a and minimalist for that the Treo 650 Skin is perfect A cool look not bulky
Iam very pleased with this item I it purchased for my son
battery 00 and I thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting
I replaced my new battery with this battery new and now it works like a champ
Just get this battery and you not will have my problems
This works item perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
The only is problem that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to fall off
When I bought my Motorola V220 my Cingular Store charged top dollar the for car charger and they were sold out
I thrilled was when I found this starter set on Amazon
The car charger is compatible with the V220 and it comes with case and handsfree ear bud all for less than I have would paid for the charger alone
The ear bud does not have the best sound voices come across as somewhat muffled though still audible and the case adequate is
I wouldnt this buy set specifically for those items although they both work withfit the V220
As I see it were they bonuses for purchasing the charger
The product is compact and convenient but feels it flimsy
The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my TXso Palm it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX
For some reason the cable wont me let charge using the USB wallcharger I got for my wifes iPod but it does charge the TX off my computers USB port which is a Powerbook G4notorious for being underpowered
reception Great great volume controls easy to use
To the reviewer who said too thin well dont the get thin phone then
Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra plug even in comes with the adaptor for plug in phones
Were in our late 20searly 30s and dig just the phone
One issue DH has the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into bottom of the phone and when is he on speaker phone he tends to hold it there and it sometimes can make your bars go down
That is it and you all have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone
its its cute little its perfect for a young woman
I had a pocket pc prior to this it and was so complicated just making a call
I wanted something simple wasnt that an mp3 player i have an ipod that wasnt a professional camera i have a nice digital cam or a pda i have a palm tx
doesnt although work that great with my bluetooth but im not sure if its the headset or the phone
almost to the point you barely can hear it in your purse
im grown accustomed listening to for the vibrate feature instead
i like how you can put a persons next picture to their name in your contact list
i can wear it the in back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable
I have to trouble buy from Bestbuy but I ordered it from amazon cheapest price and good product Thanks
The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from Scratches it fits like a glove really nice the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of use it wasnt hit treated or carelessly
Ill order some more because they are really cheap and its better to have a cover cracked than a broken phone
Love how the phone in looks it while it was in good condition the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it
The only complaint is that case the open easily if its dropped or handled in a rough way
Clear tape on the seams can easily take of care that
My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and it dropped
The case still does not have a chip or crack it on
it covers all of it so you dont need those screen plastic covers
I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and last they about sixtwelve months
I bought this one and it is much more solid of construction shorter cord and a better angle the to power adapter
i bought two of these for less than the of cost one from Sprint
My wife carries hers in purse her while I just keep mine in my car
This is the best car charger for the Treo and I have had Treos for about years 6
i like the catch that holds on it the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
I have had it for three now months and not a problem so far
The handset is wonderful and so is the headset included it with
If you buy this it phone WILL last you a long time
with my I phone know that sounds absurd but its true
Originally I had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting this one seeing how I had already done so with Motorola the V3T
Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorolas V3T RAZR handsets both for having them freeze at startup I called customer service and told I em wanted this handset instead
With a minor contract extensionhandset upgrade I was I glad made the switch to NOKIA
Ive only had it for 24 hours and Im totally satisfied it with
is Below a list of pros and cons for you to consider
MP3ringtones enabled make sure to cut your tracks to 25 about seconds if doing so
Pretty fast charge even while messing around it with
Bluetooth and infraredenabled making quick for file transfers
Date can be enabled on screen which the lacks V3T
Comes with headphone jack adapter which enables of use any standard headphone that you may have
Vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges default by
Power button somewhat is small and difficult to execute
FM radio plays with static this may varies area by
As you see can the pros outweight the cons with this one so give it at try
Also if you decide that its not for you return it to TMobile within 14 business days of your purchase and a get full refund
As for me wont I returning it because its definitely a keeper
I this purchased phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed
I havent used all the functions downloading yet music but havent had any problems with anything else
2Good Volume ringer volume is loud enough and I hear can callers just fine
1No shortcut to to get main menu have to keep pressing back button
2Battery access its really hard to take the casing off to get to battery the and SIM cardcould be a good thing though
3OnOff Button its very smallbasically have to use fingernail my
I got a chance to play with one of these week last
The external is speaker very loud the controls are easy to use and best of all it comes with a 1GB card
My only gripe the is slide feels a little loose I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake
All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capabilitysoftware is a better lot than my KRZR
I this purchased Nokia 5300 Black at the TMobile store
It does come with GB 1 memory card and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems
Phone comes with USB cable to connect to computer your
You will not able be to download songs bought from iTunes but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4
I wasnt able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook but I was to able pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car
Apple has not approved Nokia the 5300 yet to sync
I am sure it is a of matter time since the phone is rather new
Overall I love the feel of this has phone wonderful 2 in screen color is great camera is cool and it is very intuitive to use
I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to Nokia a
However the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got returned but
you Once load up your songs the speaker is impressive
This morning I had the phone playing music in one part of the house and I had to go get something at the other end of the house and I could hear still the music perfectly
I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of peoplebackground noise and I was able to carry on a conversation pleasant with her unlike my Samsung that was difficult to do this with
And I am happy have to a phone that not everyone has a Motorola Razor
Nokia This 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but I feel like I have a very unique phone that is more than a phone
Who needs an iPod mini when you get can this and your phone all in one
I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for phone this
There is very little to chose from the at TMobile store as far as accessories and Nokia
You can choose to wake up to your favorite song you that have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm
You can make calls without even having to slide phone the to dial
As long as you have the number you want stored already in your phone book then all you have to do is look up and press the green button
When you are playing your music if an call incoming comes in it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in
Once you done are with the phone call you can resume playing your music
As I said this phone a is gem in all areas speaker sturdy colorful I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing call quality is great even in loud areas and lots of little creature comforts
Definitely consider this phone if you really like to have and music bluetooth and speakerphone
I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for most the part
The first thing youll notice how is crisp and clear the screen is
This is a slider phone and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the keys number
The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new thats number not in your contacts and to text message
3MP camera camcorder music player 1GB microSD card bluetooth and support infrared port
Now the FM isnt radio satellite based so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the U
I Now will go into the good and bad things about each feature
3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras but can you show me a camera that what does this phone does 55
While you are the recording quality seems perfect
However once you it play it turns a bit distorted
Plus it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of size the of your microSD card
However I still could not find a way to change the order of the without songs making a playlist
Theres play pause song next previous song fast forward and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures
The buttons must be pressed fairly hard so your music wont start playing spontaneously in pocket your
Also I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put those on stock earbuds
FM Radio I bet those that have this phone tried use to the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement
Well truth the is you dont need to buy anything extra
Just plug in earbuds the that came with the phone and this will serve as an antenna and will allow you to hear stations
And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio the yes sound will go to the earbuds
However theres a loudspeaker option that allows the to radio be played through the external speaker but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in as it serves as the antenna
This means that if you want to hear the radio on your you phone NEED to have the earbuds with you
You may need to play around with the position of phone the and antenna or you may have to move in order to get clear reception
You cant delete the precreated profiles those come that with the phone
In order to change the phone to vibrate you must make a profile vibrating
Then to use it it takes several steps is which not hard but inconvenient
The interface shows month the and date but not the day of the week
Its much than faster the old one I used for an earlier Ericsson CF388
Good the product retractable chord feature is great and keeps the car clutter free
This one is great the retractable wire is very convenient for and storage use
It looks pretty fragile but so far its held up to heavy pretty use
Many of the other chargers Ive have owned also had problems keeping a consistent connection no such problems with this one
Easy to snap on and it wont come off easy others like
This is the one you want if you like dont the bulky one
It slides around too much it needs a smaller fit is it too big
I a have baby pink Razr and this skin looks so good over it
Also it really adds grip so its not as easy to drop and the silicone stays warm in cold weather the unlike bare metal of the razr
would I reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr they are awesome
This is cover great it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped
It isnt soft leather so if you want to protect your you RAZR might want to consider a shield
I think it will do a good job of protecting my phone case in I drop it
Hard shell protects the phone and outside leather it keeps soft and fashionable
protection on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover Ive seen for phone this
keeps keys screen and open so no dust gets pushed up against them
5mm jack and insist still buying this after look at the image then what the h
this case is pretty good snaps in on a sec and it is not too bulky
about thinking buying a couple more in different color
I am very happy with the phone case there are alot of cases available this by is far the best in my opinion
I Wow have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever
soundgreat Clear rangeand most of all its gorgeous
Only con being a loose around fit your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly
It fits actually into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it
It is to easy operate and the charge last for many days
I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just right the size
Crystal clear sound along with being very comfortable and user friendly make this headset a great cell phone accessory to have Love it price Amazons couldnt be beat
fully with compatible Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR
not the best sound quality like I Logitech better
The sound quality in both units are great but Im impressed by weight the of this LG unit
It is like comparing to stones feathers a bit exagerated but you get the point
This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud which sits in snuggly my ear
which dangled often and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls
That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my a head bit to keep the unit against my ear
With the new LG I no longer have to look like I a have stiff neck while Im driving
This came item with the other item I ordered at the same time
Its quality is good but does not stay on the phone when opened as well as I have would liked
The title says it all Fits Great Great Price Real leather and fits like a glove
This product is a good deal if you know to how use it
Unfortunately you if are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider
Verizon The Vcast product would be better because it comes with Headphones
If you already have the headphones which cost anywhere from than 20100 this product will be good for you
It fits but great doesnt cover the corners of the phone
The seam the at top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful
The bolt on the back is not so removable if you do not plan to use the belt clip youre stuck with it sticking out in your pocket
I am using this as a spare so havent actually put in it the phone yet
i bought this for my e2 tungsten since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync an idiot design if you ask me and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires
and to buy a cradle which used to with come the palms was an extra 3040 so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing
the reason why it got only 4 stars is bc when i first tried it my computer said that it didnt recognize the device usb
i searched everywhere for a technical answer to as why
it turns out that connection the was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more
so the part connector could be a little sturdier thats all
Use it every day a its nice connector that does just what it says it does
As with all TreoPalm connectors you need to make sure the contacts are clean get to a good connection
Wiggling connector the where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to work for me
Its not listed in the product description but you can find the on info ziplinqs web site
The product works very well but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful the connecting phone
Overall I would recommend if it the user pays attention when connecting
Eventually prices will be free like the Razor motorola V3
Reception is crystal clear and it also is a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card
Video voice and recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera
I was expecting just to save the touchscreen from scratches but these screens the make touchscreen also feel better
Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is tough very
Have been using just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replace it least at for another three months if at all Ill need to replace it
The problem only might be that it is hard to pull it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone
doesnt It hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did
For a holster i give 4 it stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt
One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be so having a strap on it wouldnt work well too
and because also it holds it where the strap is it adds a little wear to that area
I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall which was highly over priced my for standards
Amazon like seems a great place to buy it but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories then you can find a site with free shipping for it and its 7 bucks
Theres also another site that has for it 3 bucks but with shipping
So if want you a functional holster get this one
I have had this phone and Virgin Mobile as pay you go service for only a day or two but I wanted to write this review before I forget
you Once get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in its a good ride
Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on color the screen but its a pleasant experience
The sound quality good is on both ends of the conversation
It seems a real nobrainer given the choices other for the Virgin Mobile service
You can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuffbut youll have get to used to the funny graphics
You interact the with menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if youve been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences
One thing this whole service and software the on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine thirties
While its a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing pay as gofor you me 18cmin theres a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel
I have Lily Tomlins operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds and if I should ever receive a text message among my canned response options that come with standard the phone are Hell no Cant talk and Leave me alone
My friend has had one for a few and months loves his
He makes a good bit more money I than and sports some fancy handheld devices so its not just that its so cheap and cool
Im a longrunning Virgin customer but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry and so Ive had experience using literally of scores handsets from every imaginable carrier including nonUS
Previous Virgin phones Ive include used the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255
My 8610 still works but its a bit bulky and heavy for tastes my and I decided to upgrade
This is probably the cheapest phone of its sizecapabilities anywhere available
It is so thin that I when put it in the same pocket as my wallet I sometimes forget its there
For the cost it is pretty decent in of terms features
128x128 screen with graphic fullscreen support 10 MB for downloads 32 total speakerphone web capability comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices
For those that had have trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight
Ive found this to be very in reliable my area and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors
Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell which was also good my Kyocera old on the other hand was garbage
The phones graphics are a bit odd but not necessarily in a ways bad
Good of library games ringtones and graphics available
Now I actually something have to spend all that balance on
Its no good if you want video demand on 3G or whatnot
But for just callstexting making now and then you simply cant beat 203 months
No annual contract as well which is a huge plus as many had whove one know all too well
They are a bit stiff as well which is good and bad good because you wont accidentally press them as easily bad because is typing more of a pain
Their web service costs extra and has it problems viewing many page formats says network gremlins when you try
You can browse basic html and about thats it good luck reading email with it
No bluetooth builtin though this is be to expected
can This actually be a good thing since camera phones are offlimits in more areas than you might expect
There are flaws with it as with any phone but the pluses outweigh minuses the
Ive seen many reviewers complain about both and Virgin the phone but in my professional opinion and it is an expert opinion these people need to realize that you get what you pay for
This a isnt 200 Samsung T519 and youre not paying 60 a month for service on a 2 year contract
Considering the costs the Slice an is great handset with excellent service and that is that
Ive a been Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewerif you want a phonephone without all the extra hoopla this isnt a bad deal
I bought a red a Slice couple of weeks ago take note that Im not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear and for my needs emergencies quick calls to family from the grocery store its just right
I got mine for free with Reward Zone points Best at Buy
Nice looking someone mistook it for a Chocolate other the day
Clear reception long distance calls are just as crystal as local not sure if this is an area thing but the apparently service in and around Chicagos solid
Payasyougo option works well for someone doesnt who spend a lot of time on the phone
My Slice holds a charge just fine Ive noticed other reviewers have said this is problem a but so far so good and doesnt heat up as someone else mentioned maybe that reviewers got a defective phone or battery
Its so slim my husband has bet me Ill lose the phone within a couple of months could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on desk your
Someone else mentioned the odd graphics hot dog dripping sauce blue some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth
Seriously I have no idea what those things might be but I say its workable if have you a sense of humor
I have small hands slender fingers and I still manage to bump the 3 whenever trying Im to shut off the phone
Sometimes its difficult to on turn the button doesnt always respond when I push it though could be Im a wimp but once its on its fine
Im thinking this will get broken in more with use
I find myself at staring it just to appreciate its beauty phone confessions
And since I havent forked out hundreds of dollarsor any dollars reallyI wont feel too guilty whenif I do manage to lose it under a of pile paperwork
I got my Slicer past black Friday for from 19 Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency
The Virgin plan 18 cmin pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they originally were made to do
First 20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 months one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were reasonably very priced 30cmin to Eastern Europe
I used the phone on my trip business to call home
The reception was excellent all in 7 states I used the phone so far
They have also planty of ring tones and graphic options
for downloading mostly about priced 2 per download
The phone is nice looking and has all fancy except stuff a camera
However the memory is really small for serious more web browsing but one would not expect more for 19
I am surprised to hear that people other complained about the battery life
The only bad thing I discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone example for during the flight I had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again
I would recommend sincerely the phone and the Virgin pay as you go plan to mature users
1 When a headset is attached the phone does ring not through the external speaker
if So you are not wearing the headset when a call comes in
2 There no is option to use vibrate and ring at the same time
In Standby the phone runs out power of after about six hours
To reply to a text you have to start new a message and then search for the sender of the original message
5 The tones ring that come with the phone are horrible
Aside from those few problems have I been quite satisfied with the phone
I got phone this to use as a phone and am very happy with it
have I had it about two weeks now so this is the early review
I have a nice canon camera and dont to want use my phone to take pictures
I dont want to use my phone to listen to music surf or the internet either I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there
If you are of one those people that has a different agenda for your phone then this is probably not the phone for you
This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in and thickness width but shorter
It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without bulky feeling
It makes a razr feel thick but I am guessing it is comparable a to slvr
The Slice has good sound quality for such small a phone
Sprints is network not the best in my area but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar
When I was in the car the road noise got too loud to hear but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine keep and my hands on the wheel
Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to the use phone a lot
I expect to spend between 150 200 and this first year including the 50 up front for the phone
The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local and taxes fees included
I Although havent tried them it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level
Although ones this name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it it also looks like a real piece of equipment
an As older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP
vibrate in mode of course At the same time my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool
The UI is well designed easy and to navigate except for the ridiculous menu
What were they when smoking they decided to use a pig for my account a dragon for messaging etc
than Other that the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive
Cant really comment on on reliability this phone after just two weeks but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine
Perhaps because are they affordable in other ways Virgin screws you on ringtones and background
The four ringtones included are unacceptable and you are blocked from up or down your loading own
They do have a big pretty collection on their website you can get for 2
The included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too you so are likely to fork out 2
00 for a wallpaper from their web for site that as well
Most of the time I fine do but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small
Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I havent run into that any problem more
Battery life has not lived up to what I read but that might be because of how I it use
I ordered an extra charger to keep the in office and one for the car as well just in case
After two weeks I happy am with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls
It is not big on extras like a camera but what it it does does well
Virgin uses Sprints network see if you can find out about their in network your area before you buy a Virgin phone
I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots of phones cooler out now
Ive used it 3 for years and really like its basic functionality
The battery lasted for 3 years until and recently thats pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have lowbattery life
Im hoping itll last for more 2 years before I get a new phone to catch up with the modern world
Saves time and updownloading pics tunes my tofrom phone
The Speck rubber case is the case best ive found for my Blackberry 7290
That being said its not ideal id and make a few changes
protects Pros case well no screen scratches minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag no need to use the belt clip most women prefer pursestotebags to belt clips and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag
Cons clear case collects dirt screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight screen cover doesnt fit squarely into the rubber and case screen cover gets scratches on it making the screen harder to read
I get a lot of compliments on this case its different enough to be noticed and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to with fumble opening and closing the case
However because of the cons I suspect ill need to this replace case more than once a year
But i it like enough that ill pay the 35 to do so
Maybe next the version will have some improvements
In the meantime i feel like im getting my worth moneys out of it
Im not really a gadget guy and what gadgets I do have pretty get beat up
When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can stay touch in I needed to at least take care of the thing
a Im minimalist and for that the Blackberry Skin is perfect A cool look not bulky
THIS COVER IS SO HOT I GET TONS OF COMPLEMENTS IT ON ITS A GREAT COLOR AND THE SCREEN PROTECTOR HELPS A LOT TOO
attaches It easily and I especially like the screen cover most cases dont have this if you drop the phone and crack the screen youre hosed
only The thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip
I have had this for 2 months now and has it worked out well
I use it on my Cingular phone 8125 while I exercise I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone
When a call comes the AudiblePlayer pauses and I can answer the phone the with builtin button
Voice quality is fine my on end in both ears and I have received no complaints from the other end unlike the other reviewer maybe he got a bad unit or his stereo connector is dirty
I never to have stop my exercise or even slow down My only complaint is that the volume control doesnt work worth beans
When you rotate it at various positions you will hear from one or ear the other
There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears but is that not at the maximum volume
This is a bit annoying but something I can with live
I just leave it at one position close to the max volume but a little less and use volume the control on my cell phone to adjust volume
It is so flexible and high quality control soundvolume
plug Just in a headset of your choice and you can
It will automatically shut off the when music the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headset still ON
Works with any and headset you can hear it in BOTH ears by the way
I keep my headphones on while on treo phone cell calls because it has a BUILT in Mic which is perfect
I have a stressful job and listening to music while I am working in my home office with headset and the ability to pick up calls and leave my on headset with microphone is REALLY GREAT
In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what WORKS IT
I am still using it as it perfectly works even the camera
I used my sisters phone Razr this weekend and I hated it
The redial feature slow was and the phone not comfortable
I will be keeping my Samsung as for long as it lives
This Samsung the is most reliable phone Ive ever had
Ive had it for two years dropped it NUMEROUS times and it still is going strong with only a few scratches
battery The life has declined during this period of time but it still lasts about two days before charging
While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now am I impressed with how many applications I use daily alarm clock scheduler memo pad etc
In all honesty though the camera is terribly not great
Pictures tend to have a weird color tint when transfer you them to your computer and are often blurry
I still enjoy the if camera only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options black and white brightness flash etc
The video option is rather lame though as the footage is and choppy you cant even transfer or send it to anything
Recently when I was on a shuttle two girls with both Razors saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well
said Both they missed it and liked it better than their new phones
I am to supposed be getting a new phone too but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up
If you are looking a for decent and relatively cheap phone this is a good one
Almost 2 years my ago fiance and I signed up for a 2year contract with Verizon
And two years later both phones are in excellent condition with very few and scratches dents
This is a great phone for someone who still would like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily
I 38 have pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone
Sturdy Its not as or thin flimsy as some of the newer ultrathin phones
I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone still is in excellent condition
Another thing really I like is that when you drop the phone the battery doesnt detach easily
Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson the would battery also detach and Id have to restart my phone
Compact Though it is on the thicker side this Samsung is compact very but not too small where you fear loosing it
Good Buttons For those who text a message lot the way the buttons feel can really make a difference
The buttons on this phone are smooth and for great texting
Menu short cuts On the of side the phone you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow
press If the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera video menu pop up
You can also choose shortcut which youd like when you press up I have mine set on the calendar
Long battery life Im not one to hours spend on my cell phone but for every day use this phone is great with respect to its battery life
have There been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged
Camera has flash other neat options You can also adjust the brightness level have a self timer take shots multiple 10 different fun frames and 5 different colortones like sepia monochrome black white and negative
Phonebook Contacts easy are to access and its easy to search for entries
I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under name one
You enter can that persons home mobile fax office and pager number
You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and can you categorize your contacts in different groups
Voice commandsBy holding pressing the button a voice command menu appears
Its a nice feature is but not something I often use
Speed dailing One feature that I do take advantage of is dailing speed
Its nice only having to press a button instantly to connect with another person
Menu styles There are 2 different menu styles you use can
I like the nature option which cute has animation for each subcategory you scroll through
My fiance uses the icon style which is a simple more design
Despite the 15 generous ring tones its hard finding a ringtone that doesnt make you want to pull your hair out
Out of the 15 ring tones there only are about 2 decent ring tones
Antenna I dont use the antenna very often but when I do has it a hard time staying up and is very flimsy
If you intend on taking a lot pictures of I would recommend investing in a better picture phone
Overall cell This phone is exactly that a cell phone to make calls
It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but is it still a fairly basic phone
It was my first phone ever and when it came time to get a new one i just couldnt find a as phone great as this one
So if your looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anything cause let me tell you mine went through world war 3 and its still working like new and not to mention the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of other the phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in time if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect i was and still am real pleased with this phone and it is an excellent phone for anyone
If youre hard on your electronics like I am phone this is for you
I put mine the through washing cycle as in washing machine yes three times let it dry overnight and it still works perfectly
Ive also run it through the dryer twice dropped countless it times thrown it at a wall and ran over it on a mountain bike
The camera still works and I think the reception actually BETTER got after going through the washer
All it has is some scratches on the casing and bent a antenna
This is a perfect for phone a onthego klutzy person
The camera is pretty good and its small and cute in size and it good has reception
Similar This Unit is 14th the Cost of the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300 and it is JUST AS GOOD
Bottom line it is a just Piece of Plastic that gets the Job don
Ive had snapon my case for about a month and I love it
The magenta color looks very much like the original pink phone razr
The bottom case could fit a more little snugly but its not a problem
Fits great My Wife likes bright the color as it is easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone
The and color fit were great I was worried since it was a phone from Altell but it fit like a glove Thanks
You dont have to get a car charger but its a good idea if you have car a
It fits well even and though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it
I found that i had to file the plug charging as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit
But sometimes it can slip and the press buttons on the side of your phone
It can either make phone the not work or run down the battery
First of all fast shipping and second of all what great a product it is I absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees it Thanks
I have gotten many compliments the on looks of this cover
I have actually dropped my phone and this protected has it
Only one complaint the clip is not enough tight on my belt would recommend a little tighter
This case is well equiped the handle wearing on it belt at worl plays movies etc
easily access good looking It functions any at level
The case fits like a glove Appears high with quality the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching
The cover and back were easy attach to and did not scratch my phone which I checked by removing the case
My complaint only was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt
No problem if you slide off the back cover and take off the small foam piece on the inside you will see a screw tiny
There will a be hole in your cover if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece
Attach the back cover to the phone and then fill in the hole with piece a of felt
If you are a clip user the clip is clear and plastic cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it
But maybe that is a good thing so that it wont fall accidentally off
I cannot comment on how well the case will wear since I have only a had few days
I the chose navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone
This was a great price for battery this with twice the capacity of the standard battery
The only thing I dont like the is lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around
Id it give 5 stars if not for the cheezy cover it falls off sometimes
I like the of shape the plug so that it doesnt cover up any other outlets
If anyone needs one for twentyfive shipping plus that has not been registered with Net10 still has bonus 300 minutes and no number is new and has all original accessories open package or for ten extra you can get an OEM car charger leather case and earphone all unused please email movieshopathotmaildotcom
Ive had TracFone service for 2 now days and glad I switched
C139 The is small compact and fits in my shirt pocket
It lacks in tones ring and the address book could be better but for a simple phone its all I need
dont I need the internet access and all the other features I end paying for and not using
TracFone was quick to transfer my phone number which happened 1 in day and they said it would take 7 days
I wont go back to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in a on service agreement for 2 years
have I good service and will be saving 300 a year now
If you want a nice small light and simple phone that all you want to is do make and receive phone calls this is the one
the For 50 bucks you pay here you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime
Thats not a bad deal if considering you bought the phone itself elsewhere it would be 20 bucks and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately 20 some odd bucks or so
I Frankly see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere
the Regarding sim card I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion
A sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD electro static discharge just like RAM computer is
ESD is probably the primary reason why so reviewers many phones here have failed
Id bet single every one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows
Before you the handle sim card you should ground yourself by touching something metal
Otherwise run you the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD
I just transferred my mobile from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139 about the only edge the c139 over has the V120c is the color display
Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the ringtones bundled and the wallpaper
IMO Motorola could have added a port to accomodate USB a interface to this model
It was shortsighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c also in the same price range has such port a
Voicemail is extremely problematic set to up at this time
I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday 102806 and it took over 5 hours my for number to be transferred over to the new phone
In Southern California the network this model uses TracFone is Cingular
Suffice it to say I followed the all instructions on the website explicitly however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesnt recognize my number and to input my voicemail number
I anticipate nothing but problems technical with support when I contact them
They are very polite as customer service reps however they can barely speak or English understand
I am envisioning hours of BS with the call I have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these are reps not technical whatSOever
Note to Tracfone Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most NOT assuredly TECH SUPPORT
Also I wasnt overly impressed with keypad the where it concerns text messaging
But the c139 does have one advantage in this regard text cost messages only 0
3 units versus on the V120c was TracFone deducting 0
units 5 for each incoming and outgoing text message
Im not sure why that considering is the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone
It should be one uniform deduction across board the
Consumers should contact TracFone customer and service inquire about this phenomenon
Bottom line is that I would recommend phone this to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone and wants an inexpensive phone with a much easier on the eyes color display
as Inexpensive in you bought it from a retailer for 20 bucks
But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper and a little more flexibility get then yourself a Nokia 2126
For the same money you spend here the Nokia is a phone better
has It a USB port a speakerphone plus other extras
And you probably wont have any trouble up setting the voicemail either
i like that it has free waiting call and free caller id
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer a program friend will give each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an email and i will send you fast a referral
Customer service is fine and the voicemail free was easy to set up and use
If you decide to get tracfone a please email me for a quick referral before activating it we each will get 100 free minutes from the refer a friend program
Ill also send you the simple to instructions follow
Ive used Tracfone for quite a while so i should be able to answer any questions you have might
ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should be able to us get the free minutes
i like that it has free waiting call and free caller id
if you havent activated tracfone your yet then the refer a friend program will give each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an email and i will you send a fast referral
I have had this phone for about months 6 now and all together is has been great
I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides its that good
I had have so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces
This i phone dont have that problem it is really made good
i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got and it its fine
we Are all talking about the same phone here I havent had any problems with it and using it is a breaze
I bought this phone after I wanted to change my plan calling so I wouldnt get stuck with roaming charges while I was away far from my calling area
My old also phone an LG wasnt compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old ATT service
I love the fact that I can MP3 download ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for
does It not have a camera and I was not looking for one
I already own three very good stand cameras alone why bother with another I was although a little aggravated having to reenter all of my old phone book information because thats the only way you can do it
The manual is not hard read to at all unless you are dyslexic
After two nobrand aftermarket cables which were invisible to the phone and Nokia Phone Suite this cable the and included software driver worked perfectly
Note Nokia Phone Suite must be downloaded separately but is free of charge
We have uploaded photographs from Nokia our 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone
Nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an cable expensive
I pricing recommend accessories before selecting your next phone
Some Motorola phones accept universal a miniUSB cable which I believe is cheaper
Although I have not used the headset yet the case and work charger perfectly
careful Be Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz
Read the Vital section Statistics in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz
Check the web Sony page and other people who sell this phone and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz
I dont own this phone but was researching it for a when friend I discovered this discrepancy
I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror I case have no idea if this phone is really good or not
Purchased this phone a little over a month ago and so far works everything well and have no problems
Many nice features and the service in the of state GA is good
I bought this phone as part of the SERO SprintNextel plan
I used it for about 14 days before that deciding it didnt fit my needs for several reasons outlined below
Battery life was sporadic I got maybe a day worth of power it from
For the price of the phone and the two year contract it carries this is dealbreaker a
The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years so have I some experience with coverage around town
I was disconnects getting and sporadic no signals
An incoming call would light up the display there but would be no ringing
This seems to happen after I had the put phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring
For the same monthly service fee I was getting less access to web services and no high Internet speed ability
Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen but if Im going to be locked into a 2 year contract I would like to some have fast internet access on the phone
If I were then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher since Nextel presently has arguably the best functioning fully walkie talkie network
I could not justify being locked into a 2 year with contract equipment that seemed subpar on a network that did not and likely never will support the latest high speed technologies
were Below my initial impressions during the time I used the phone
Thankfully designed Motorola the phone so the microSD card is accessible from the outside no need to pull the battery to update the card
You CANNOT any use mp3 songs that you transfer to the microsd card as ringtones
You also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took the with phone or a paid download
Any message mms that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller image id and not wallpaper
Battery life on my phone is flaky Im getting maybe a day and onehalf with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to picture 10 messages
There are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off microSD their memory card however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with
Note Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the company same
Nextel there are only a couple reasons that I can think of to recommend over Nextel Sprint
Second if you have a need use to the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature
The side Sprint of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications
The Nextel side clings to the larger phones and their aims services at the industrialconstruction market
For almost every consumer the Sprint is side a better deal
Sprint my in experience has better customer service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives
Heres my summary of this phone after using it two about weeks
Nextel smsmms messages can now be autodownloaded I this believe is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature
cant play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other nonNextel transfer Note Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal make to transfers with a cable but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle
Nextel is my in opinion on their way out as a carrier soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things
While not entirely it unexpected means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to nonconstruction users Nextels core group
If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most Sprint plans which them include
doesnt Nextel have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers
Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character based wap that sites both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens
the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown to accustomed
while not phone related some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a of lot busy signals
am I only getting about a day of battery life which is extremely low
I just wished I looked up at the on pictures here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first
how brilliant They shouldve some provided sort of User Guide on how to put the case on
The seller awesome is very Amazonlike shipping i
The leather is nice and what you cant see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering the over keyboard
When closing the keyboard the plastic does a catch little but I think that will go away the more I use it
phone The fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior
Each exterior button is given own its hole in the leather
The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however is there clear markings in the leather designating ok and ptt
The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to touchscreen the
On flopside the of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc
Another thing not mentioned in its description is that comes it with a belt clip however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case
I was very happy to see that Amazon shipped me PalmOne brand Styluss and some not generic
This is a great deal and Im going to order more some
The hell with Palm that changes with stylus every new model
Great battery the now phone goes way longer without needing to be recharged
I ordered this headset in silver Webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really IS silver We argued about the color and I finally convinced them that makes Samsung white silver red and black
It took almost a month to get resolved but I finally have the silver headset that ordered I
There are 3 different size earpieces for a fit better
The headset gets 4 stars Webtreo only gets star 1
This is by far the best bluetooth headset in the market it is small and very light as well just like wearing earing an
The sound is amazingly clear people on the other end thought I was actually my using phone
I have no problem with it falling off just make sure stopper the is placed correctly inside your ear
Im so happy with this cutie that Im buying it for sisters my friends
Consumer Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset the as best
I can hear my while callers driving and they can hear me
Samsung The is also an extremely small and discrete headset so you wont look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car
And if you want be to one of those people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places its small enough where people will really wonder if youre a crazy person talking to yourself
Gimme a break The Samsung also comes a with cool carrying case that doubles as a charger
This is super handy since the headset is so small and would be easy to lose or damage if for not the sturdy but not at all bulky carrying case
The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headset that did I not quickly return due to poor headset volume
I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after first my few drives in my car
I could simply not hear the people to whom I was talking
The Samsung is first the to provide enough volume
Im still happy it with after two months of ownership
The Samsung was also approximately 35 cheaper on than Amazon at Best Buy or other retailers whether online or in person
The only reason I gave Samsung the four stars and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stay in your ear while running
I learned this one morning when I was late for work and from ran my car to my office
If the Samsungs short talk time is not a concern for you then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide performance better in such an extremely small package
The button the on headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call
Works much better more and reliably than ANY BlueTooth set Ive tried and Ive tried almost all of them
only problem is that it is easy to drop and scrren the smudges easil
This has case good quality construction and fits properly
It solves the problem of being able plug to in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case
I prefer a magnetic closure to velcro this which case uses
I also prefer the of option having the phone horizontal on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working
The fixed belt clip design only allows positioning vertical
This is still best the optional case if you want to use the MP3 player feature and require the use of earphones
recently I took a chance on this item and I am happy to report that its not bad
I was actually not looking forward to a swivel bad experience the but swivel is very solid
The only problem I have with it is that you have to take out phone the completely in order to use it
My only complaint is that the cord is bit a short but that is of lesser concern considering the price
The short cord is the only reason it didnt get 5 a star rating
you can tell that the quality is not as good the as one you would get in a retail store
but it does the job well and i have never had a problem it with
I have nothing but good to things say about this purchase and product
I only wish they make could a PDA phone that wasnt as big as a boat
However the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls easily off
The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not you allow to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster
How stupid is that Why would Samsung supply this of type holster to their customers
You can now flip open your phone when using holster this
wasnt I expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case but Im very impressed
I bought accessory from one the total cost was about 4
The case fits nearly perfectly every hole is the right size and in the right place not as exact as possible but everything works just as as well without the case
Others have complained of chipping paint but in the week been Ive using this it hasnt chipped yet
If I remove the belt clip there is still an impediment where it to use be
For the and quality fit of this cover the price is a bargain
It fits very snugly and the rubberized material the improves grip
I found the razr v3 to be akward or slippery at times this and cover takes care of that problem
If youre looking for a cover slim that wont add a lot of bulk to your RAZR this one is great
No it probably WONT provide much protection if drop you your phone
It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints and the rubberized material is easy grip to and feels great in your hand
The cutouts for the outside display camera I have a V3m and M are logo perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well
I dont use the belt clip as the cover by itself adds hardly any bulk so I just keep my in phone my pocket
Without the belt clip there is a small snap that sticks out a bit from the back of the cover but its really no deal big
Thought post Id this info here since this subject still confuses people
I just talked to a cust representative care who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180day period will invalidate 250 Amazon phone rebate
Well I guess that a is major turn down for me for this phone and this offer since I dont really need a data plan and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time
I still would like to give it stars 5 since I believe it is a great product
Ill take one star off however due for its battery weak life and lack of standard audio connection 2
There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most fairly are accurate
My intent is to some document of the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future
I am a business user who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 my and Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device
I use a Motorola H700 headset with my old and devices the 8525
My overall assessment is my Replacing two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I dont think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use
All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola phone flip
If readers find that there is a way to perform any of the deficiencies I describe please let know me
Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue headset tooth regardless of the PDA volume setting
To hear my voice commands repeated I have to turn on the annoying sound of the PDA so when I voice dial via my Blue headset tooth I can hear my voice commands repeated back
I am referring to the standard dial voice that comes with the 8525
One quick solution would be to tie headset BT to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA
Even nicer would be an upgrade that full allows audio with the VoiceCommand software this is documented in many other reviews
Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was as soon as the BT was the detected phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate
It changed back to the original audio setting after off turning the BT headset
If 1a I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS display the voice dial page
Instead the initial Owner Info page stays up and you cant see the name the on screen unless you reach down and tap the screen
If you didnt set the PDA its to annoying noise level you cant hear the name you requested either
2 Need to be to able control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio Vibrate or OFF
For example need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting OFF on or vibrate
3 Need to be able to program how the long display stays on
I am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as turns it off when I need to see something
4 I would buy a non headset Bluetooth if one was available for long drives when my BT headset battery is dead
Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while on driving the freeway
5 Provide a built in way to make the PTT Comm and Manager and IE Quick key buttons programmable
I would use them for many other functions such as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker need be to able to select speaker here see below
6 Give me a way to press an external button to between toggle speaker on and off
cant I easily push the speaker icon with my fingers
Add a radio button on the volume control that allows you to speaker select phone
you Yes can select the phone speaker soft button but often the display has gone blank and the keypad is showing
7 Provide option save to email attachments to storage card
That was on my IPAQ OS Windows and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory
8 Remember the setting Filter I selected for Tasks
I If have filtered by a task category during that session remember the filter I selected
Currently I have so many tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them up all
9 Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key or make this button programmable I am always having to close browser the because it gets hitselected
10 Let EditPaste me with one step for notes word task notes etc
With 8525 OS you must select Menu then then Edit Copy
Question is there a key on the keypad to CNTRL select C for copy like what is done on a PC the letters are underlined in the menu but I dont see a CNTRL key on the keypad
Allow 11 the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the top and then use the nav button to move across the icons might be the way to allow an external way to set audio volume
12 If I power off the device have it remember input my selection
I recently got the 8525 and i it loved at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do
However eventually i found out that phone the part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone
My friends complain that they a hear lot of outside noise while talking
The phone earvolume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in places noisy
Software The windows applications Word Excel player Media
Plus Ability to create office documents and games play
Hardware Micro sd Sandisk slot card cost me 20 bucks
Wireless Internet You could connect device this to any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet
I dont have a data plan with Cingular i but connect to the internet from home through my WIFI home network
iam If at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free
The view is finder sloppy and cannot capture images in low light
Battery needs to be charged every day second depends on usage but even with light use i had to charge it every other day
listen To to music need to purchase microsd card
Leather case Boxwave by fits pretty good and protects the device
The only problem is that after put you this case on the phone volume needs to be set to the max even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well
But the case boxwaver could be opened half way and folded over
If you are ok with inconveniences minor while using the phone this is for you
Build quality typical is of HTC meaning very good
The call quality good is provided youre in a decent service area system not overloaded with AMRHR kicking in
The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed much use more manageable
The slide out keyboard is easy use to and provides very good tactile feedback
There is a huge community user and a very large knowledge base to consult this is perhaps the ultimate geek phone
The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and the provides usual suite of applications and productivity tools
There is learning a curve involved with Windows Mobile but IMHO its not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be
In general things work as they are supposed to with phone this
One drawback is while that the device does support the Bluetooth A2DP profile stereo bluetooth sound the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible
The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono which means youll have to manually edit the registry to enable stereo true sound over bluetooth
The bluetooth sound stereo is also set to a very low quality which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve
And even after all of that still there exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio
In other words dont waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if take you your audio seriously
However the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular monoone ear BT headsets recommend I the Jawbone and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable
Another audio related drawback of this device is There not even a 2
The only physical audio out is through HTCs jack proprietary which is also the power and data jack
The saving grace here is the that earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable and also the availability of HTCto3
Even with a few shortcomings I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best Phone PocketPC on the US carrier subsidized market
It an packs incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor
youre If in need of a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices this is your phone
Purchased this phone as a for replacement my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed
I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several years now it and appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professionalbyday GadgetFreakbynight guy
If you dont read anything else in my please review understand this
1 This is a Microsoft OS and things go will bump
2 If you are NOT in the market for around spending 110 a month for a service plan voice and data you have no business with this phone
This is a productiviy enhancer it is not 100 perfect but a as data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day this phone does the trick
The battery life isnt that bad as I have this thing in its cradle included not during the day
Active Sync is so to easy setup a noob could do it
The only reason reason I didnt give it 5 stars is the fact that it cant make me a cocktail
This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia its quite popular in and Singapore the HTC TyTN in Europe but in an unlocked model
and quite a bit more than expensive what Cingular sells it for here
If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product you will think its a over heavy feature laden product that you will never fully use and its a problematic one at that
Having said that this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones today available
are such that you would never to need bring a laptop with you
There were initial with problems this phone in the Asian market that have now been since resolved and is now robust and reliable
But one caveat to keep mind in when using this product
Meaning if you not are familiar with Windows devices it may frustrate you
But if you can overlook that will it perform better than anything available
Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brandnew 3GWificamera smartphone equipped
It also very worked well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service
Email and internet works well very in both locations
Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette and use a card reader and cable USB for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips
The color and calibration default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone
Again 1GB allow you take to a very long video in Windows Media Player format
Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails contacts and calendar any time any place automatically and chime schedule notices
The only drawback are the battery life which require frequent charges slow keypad for phone calls and I do not know how to silence the keypad a and little tough keyboard touch
Lack of shift keys on both sometimes sides makes key typing difficult especially shiftA
In addition Microsoft Word is processing slow and so as Excel which will require a faster chip
Overall a great allaround pocket PC this in generation
I bought my 8525 when they first came out like two months ago right christmas after
I upgraded a to 2gig memory card and also have the GPS service
I love my phone though it might have time problems to time and some getting used to
this Overall was the best purchase for the price I ended up spending almost 900
but I also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and other some features
I would like to the see iPhones operating system though
Yes you do have to restart the device it does get hung but i dont blame the phone after it all has windows mobile 5 in it
The restart has occurred twice to me in past the week So be careful
Other the than fact that it has windows The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have
If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it wifi has capabilities Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature
Once you buy the phone i suggest that you get this software Spb plus Pocket
It helps shutting down softwares running in the and background adds more features
The clarity screen is amazing and it has great features
Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this too windows
I bought this cable knowing by the reading reviews that it might not work so for the price I gave it a shot
USB This cable was a replacement for my other cable that was used as a chew toy by my dog
Since I already had DataPilot susteen software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computer with the phone attached it saw it as a susteen USB cable and all installed the drivers on winXP if you dont have susteen driverssoftware you can obtain the drivers for the USB cable for your phone from their website free download
I never used the installation CD that came with this USB cable and I installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes also it works with the DataPilot software but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830
i like that it has free call waiting and free id caller
if you havent activated your tracfone then yet the refer a friend program will give each of us 100 free minutes
send please me an email and i will send you a fast referral
Once i got the phone activated I havent any had problems
Tracfone has a refer a program friend that will give each of 100 free minutes
All you have to do send is me an email asking for a referral
Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us lose who things
Just unscrew the tip of the stylus and youve got pen a
You never know when youll need one when so you do there it is
It also blends in well the with design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactilely
product The came promptly and I am happy with the quality
However fitment wasnt perfect as the ends would sit little a higher than my treo
Not a huge problem but something I would everytime feel I reach for the stylus
But the pen works pretty good it and feels sturdy in my hands
I definately would recomment this product to others
This is the and original at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy
Fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for V188 the
Fried my original one used when it abroad with wrong voltage
Shipping was a steep little for such and inexpensive item
I definetly continue will to do business with Amazon and A1 Accessories
Kind difficult of to place without getting some kind of stuff between the screen and the protector
I recently bought a Nokia 6265 wanted and to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones
However the Nokia CA53 cable was around dollars 50
So far everything that I have used it for working is flawlessly
I would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than CA53 the
This product helps you copy anything your on computer to your nokia phone
Eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and I completely want bussiness more with them
Comes with an unlabeled couldnt cd tell one side from the other that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones arent labeled in any helpful way
It also has links to any 1st party software you need though Im a sure Google search would be just as easy
I bought this case my for LG Chocolate and it is perfect
The belt is clip very strong making accidental unclipping rare
pouch The is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts
The front flap also is reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets
bottom The of the case has a small hole for access to the Chocolates End button
allows This you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case
The only dislike I have is the name Cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really big a deal
I would recommend this case to who anyone owns a Chocolate
had Ive this case for under a month but its working great
When I first got the case I thought I was going to have to send it back because I thought it was small too for my phoneI have an LG CU500 from Cingular
The case has since seemed to a stretch little so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out
The computer recognizes my phone when I plug it in but the drivers on the provided CD are pretty worthless much
I needed a Razr Car Charger the and Crystal Clear Hard Shell Case was included with the purchase
did I not think I would even use it but I love it It is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my Razr phone
There are stick belt on clips that work fine with this
a nice bonus hard shell case that doesnt Razrs ruin stylish look a single bit
The charger wasnt very fancy but it seems to work fine the and price was very reasonable
I wasnt interested in the case but after I it got I found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal
Eventually prices will be free like motorola the Razor V3
Reception crystal is clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card
Video and voice recording and capabilities a 8x zoom camera
Im it using with TMobile so your mileage may vary
In opinion my its a featurepacked phone at a reasonable price for an unlocked smart phone at least
The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well although I did experience some lags and software freezes with apps thirdparty
I think the menu organization could be smarter but you can customize of much it
I do love that the default displays screen your days calendar agenda
Photos with the 3megapixel are camera grainy it also has a VGA camera
Since this is a phone first and not a camera there is also no control stabilization
Your family friends and colleagues will hear you clearly
On your however end it will sound like youre talking on a cell phone
Its bad not but Ive had conversations on better sounding phones
I disagree slightly another with commenter about wireless internet WLAN access
The problem is that if you arent at that location regularly will you have to search for a new network
One around way it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider
I agree however that some kind of onebutton autodetect be would ideal
The metal cover pops off easily fairly as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first
The phones slider form factor moves perhaps smoothly too much so
By default sliding the completely phone open something thats hard but not impossible to do accidentally unlocks the keypad
Its 5way controller button also looks and feels a cheaper bit than youd probably expect
The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid sensible and
When enabled it works contextually on automatically for SMS and email messages off and when typing URLs
I Overall give this phone high marks for features but a few annoyances mean its far from The Perfect Phone
got I this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back
Just off right the box the phone is quite impressive
Many complain about the response time yes phone this is slow but doesnt bother me far better than my windows machine Overall very good phone for what it offers
This phone tops in ergonomics ease of use presentation features speakerphone Bluetooth and call quality
Nokias connection manager is superior far than anyone else in the market
It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots money of
I accidentally downloaded a big chunk of data and going pay to through my nose next month
All the apps that come with this phone are good quite
Also I musicthemesringtones transfer using data cable from my Wintel
The phone automatically toggles to Mass storage when mode it is connected to PC which is pretty neat
I havent faced any such problem as charge I my gadgets daily
I also tried leaving uncharged it and it comes for 23 days good enough for my call volumes
Having the wifi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while youre at home and then use it wisely while you away are
Camera settings similar are to professional cameras very very impressive
life Battery as many claim seems short but I charge my gadgets daily so not a big issue
The headset that comes with the is phone really good
Tonnes of themes apps available etc for this phone
My first biggest problem is that main the navigation key is badly designed
It is made of cheap plastic and 8 almost out of 10 times I selected an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left
My second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on screen the light does not come up
So you wont know even in the day which button to press to answer the question Unlock phone you will get that practice by but it is truly a pain
The picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what get you
There is a serious between lag the shutter click and the final image
I sincerely if hope there would be some sw patch for this
I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras an with exception of Sony Ericsson W810i
That is one far superior camera quality I so saw far
I am putting this on the section bad as even if the slider opens in your pocket the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing
So you would need a app small to do the locking properly
At point this Nokia has better phones like N95 etc of course very expensive
I think this is going to be a good very phone but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800
well I called NokiaUSA direct and regular retail from is them 499
all day as many as you want so it should considerably be less on Amazon
I recieved good customer service and excellent from help these guys
Thanks for allowing me to keep this phone my with network
I didnt want to give it up just and yet you allowed me to get another phone just like the one I had
My V180 is through Cingular I never have a dropped call and is reception excellent
Long Battery life very easy and menuswayfinding small size
No frills like MP3 or player camera however just a very good phone
Ive had this phone for a year and a with half no problems
It is good for making calls is which really all I ask for from a phone
It is easy enough to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and theyve had problems no
My carrier is Cingular and Ive had excellent service in the NY tristate area and because it is a quadband phone Ive also been able use to it while roaming internationally
Battery life is just okay not as as good my old Nokia
I to have recharge every other day with normal use
Overall its lasted me long enough that I would call a it good value
If youre the type of person that doesnt spend on HOURS the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you
I bought this phone in the UK at the warehouse Carphone for around 40 bucks and it works great
I say would that the only gripe about this phone in the US is the price I wouldnt pay over 40 bucks for it
The screen is a colored one and it has ringtones cool
It didnt seem possible that the stuff would actually work for a such low price
Even though shipping was steep it was still the worth money
The case fits great and it hasnt at cracked all
Both chargers work great I think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this charger wall than the one that came with it but I cant complain I would highly recommend this package
just for car the charger alone verizon wanted 24
the plastic cover for the phone is very good the as razr phone scratches pretty easily
The chargers might a feel little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality
Helps reduce clutter and now I actually can close my cup holder tray Acura RDX
It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended it doesnt get in the like way the spiral cords do
I never measured the cord extended when but it is much longer than most
You go to your service provider store and buy a car charger and it will cost you bucks 30 but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better
The retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones you that can purchase from cigular or sprint stores
Ive had for it about 2 months and I am still happy with it
It a has little blue led light that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but I like it
I like the way it doesnt up take space in the console when I am not using it and it seems to charge the L6 just fine No complaints with the devise or the service from Amazon
ive had this charger for the last couple of months and it fits in my phone and perfectly i have had no problems with it
is It highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone
Car charger serves it purpose charges it the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter
You just need to make sure you plug connector the in the right way
I would have liked some type of label would that have identifed it as a motorola compatible device
cord The is a little short but have had no functionality issues
was It exactly what I needed and works as well as one that would have cost me 20 or more in the stores
I purchased this battery becuase my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of serviceso it time was
It last does longer and Im glad I bought this battery
I have bad no reviews about this so if you have an audiovox 8910 cell phone and you need an replacementthis is the one
It is the standard Palm battery meaning it is probably underpowered to relative the power consumption of the device
Note also when that using Bluetooth andor the Blackberry Rim email service battery life is notably reduced
The solution would be lower consumption device or a bigger capacity battery neither of which appear possible at the moment
It very installed easily with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first day
It has far out performed and put shame to the more expensive bulkier unit it replaced
This navigation system is truly a useful tool when in traveling areas you are not familiar with
did I a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch
The Krusell case holds the securely Blackberry and yet maintains easy use
Cosemetically it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards This an is excellent product
I used to forget my wallet but I always had my blackberry so I bought this then since I my take phone every where but not my wallet This salved the problem
This is good for people who forget their or wallet phone but remember to bring the other
I love this because case it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one
It is nice just to have to keep up with one less thing
I highly recommend it you if like carrying less stuff
These are well worth money the for your Nextel Phone Although it may not list it from Experience these batteries fit 95 of all the Nextel phones
Take a look at your phone battery to see if its the shape same
The color will different be as these have a white cover
They a are good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store
Plus these were NEVER used before Unlike celluar the store battery these batteries come in a box with the battery in shrink wrap so you know the battery has not been used
When you buy then in the cellular store they in are a plastic box that can be opened and closed and youd never know it plus there is no shrink wrap Ever buy a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months Hmmm I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one Would you know
These batteries are well worth it one Buy or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days
This works charger perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
is It very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone
This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an battery additional
However it seems expensive for what you not get to mention the fact that what the text doesnt tell you is that you need an additional expensive serial cableadapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable
Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time save money and just get nifty the travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price
and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while charges it
i couldnt believe how small it is compare the to pictures i saw online
however one bad thing about that that is i lost it already
i would recommand it to whos anyone thinking about buying one
When I lost my Stylus I had a time difficult finding a replacement
Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phone models A630 A850 A970 A950 A930 A990 A645 and A870
thin The adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office
I originally bought another Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which twice was the price of this one
I returned the other one because this one worked just good as if not better It actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer
Its a great product for a great Delivery price was quick too
It fits like a glove and the protects phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases
Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene polymer like
All buttons of the phone are accessible through case the
The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and easily remove and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of waist your
You cannot access the keyboard without removing the from phone the case
The clear plastic screen covers that the phones screen is a little to far from the surface of the phones screen
This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with stylus the near the corners of the screen
The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with and use make this easier but Im not sure
On the positive side can you easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online
The screen perfect is for text but not for pictures
Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with pilots palm
I expected to use it like a typical pilot where write you on the screen
Good reception great sound quality Speakerphone is great features Neat
Treo600 The has all the functions I needed phone calendar camera etc
1 the screen is not good for viewing pictures but what thats I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo650
the 2 phone failed to dial two times in two months
I had turn to off the phone and on again to fix the problem
This is a good thick screen protector that stays stuck solidly to your screen
It has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on but glare the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on
Ive washed mine it out comes clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky
Just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in place one
It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending if and you bend it IT WILL NEVER GO BACK
Durable thick doesnt interfere in any way with touch the screen
I havent had to wash it yet so I havent tried out feature that
But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these its been totally worth it to me hey after spending hundreds on your Treo whats few a dollars
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different anything from youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen against hope hope that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screen is off you see the thankfully bubbles when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a different completely animal
And because of those properties they go on with NO and bubbles they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its there on good
This is the state of the art screen for protectors
And this all becomes an even bigger for issue men because of whiskers over time the screen will get dulled and scratched
Because of the thickness and quality of scratches these to the screen are no longer an issue
I had up it and running in minutes with my LG VX8600 Verizon
I downloaded BitPM software free to use with the cable
I just followed the installation instructions that on came the CD that comes with the cable
I clicked discover on phone in BitPM to have it automatically find the phone
I didnt even need to and go look for the com port as the installation says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phone
When installing sure make you pick the right driver
if you have XP choose the XP driver not the NT Win98 or or other driver
My only complaint is in the description they dont the state length of the cable
My tower for my computer is in another room I that keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly
I had to extend this cable by soldering on 3 another feet of wire as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall
I projected the to cable be about 6 feet and if you do yourself youre in for a surprise
cable This is only about 3 feet long otherwise everything is fine
The description doesnt state this but the actually cable comes with the drivers for the phone models which really helped me
On a better note took shipping a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated
I have a VX9900 enV this and cable works great with it in conjunction with BitPIM
Not much say to about it really it does what it should
got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping it and works great drivers work and everything awesome deal for 3 bucks
Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you to have install
No synchronization software is included you so have to use a thirdparty tool like bitpim
I ordered this cable December on 1st got it on the 8th
It came with drivers but didnt I need it because I found drivers online
The cable fit perfectly with my LGVX9900 and to my surprise charges it too
I recently purchased the metal black case for my 8525 and have had a few problems wit
First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip to it my belt
Second the aluminum case isnt the sturdiest so now its sort of bent referring to the hinge guess I Ive been really rough on my phone but I just bend it back to where its supposed to be referring to the hinge
my phone looks and just performs as the day I got it
When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip instead I recieved a full refund so that a was pleasant suprise
actually I liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone
The K790a is currently the best Cybershot camera phone in Sony Ericssons lineup but more are on way the and also handsdown the best camera phone in the U
Its too bad that SE doesnt sell their 5MP and 6MP camera stateside phones
But the K790a is very capable a as digital camera
Sure only its 3MP but like many professionals will tell you pixel count is only one thing
This 3MP camerainaphone takes betterlooking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Aptech Vivitar sp Samsung and other offbrand companies
My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone but when I got the K790a to use with prepaid my SIM card I was simply blown away by the quality
Of course I bought the phone exactly because I had of heard great things about its picture quality but the results still far exceeded my high expectations
I dont care for the MMS features because my prepaid service Speak Wireless Out doesnt support them
I just download them to my PC using a USB reader card
I wish there were optical zoom more and more camera phones in Japan including from models Casio now have optical zoom but the truth is of course that if you need serious picturetaking you still use a real digital camera
But this comes real close replacing to your workhorse digicam
Ill this use for a year and upgrade to SEs next gen next year hopefully by then theyll have released optical zoomequipped K phones
Reception is pretty good the on TMobile Cingular networks used by Speak Out Wireless
are Pictures amazing for a phone MP3 player could use a little help
Screen is beautiful as and always menu interface is a treat
The phone is Java 2 compliant however many programs that run in the background will notify not be able to notify you unless the program is open
Very other than the player MP3 and Java notification issues the phone is a 5
purchased the phone about 3 months like the QVGA nice screen and impressed with excellent cam it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors
phone the has good reception at least on par with W810
voice call is but OK as other users stated the level is kinda low esp speakerphone firmware upgrade R1KC001 will help
the operation standard is SE style if you are familiar youll be OK without reading manual
audio the player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio still used by BBC and it works well with TMobile internet it can play local mp3 VBR supported wma asf audio rename the extension to
wma realaudio I but wish it supports ogg vorbis which is the audio format I use
bluetooth works pretty well it works with ALL bt I equipment have including wireless headphones
logitech headphones users please read in order to make the headphones works properly you need go to to bt menu and connect from there
web browser can handle regular html sites well as as simplified html and wap sites
the phone is kinda bulky and a bulge on cam cover its but pretty comfortable and firm to hold making messaging is a good pleasure
though the phone has lot of functionsfeatures are pretty appealing it lacks something its supposed have to
quadband this is not acceptable for this price even many lower models quadband have K550 W610 W580 W810 Z710 W710
player music should have more file format support ogg vorbis streamimg wmaasf shoutcast
m2 card memory though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB PSP card is a lot cheaper
QVGA screen and shows it clock when the phone is idle
low earpiece and speakerphone level though firmware will upgrade fix
conclusion if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam go for it however if you travel a lot settle with quadband theyre models cheaper
Ive had cell 3 phones prior to this one all Motorola and I really thought they were all pretty good phones
However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water Its very compact and durable you can tell it was made with an incredible level of control quality
This is why bought I the phone now I am never without a camera
The flash is good and strong so it takes great pictures with focus good
I dont really use the mp3 feature because I have iPod an
However I was VERY disappointed that it wouldnt allow me to use mp3s ringtones as
I heard this was my because service provider is a jackass and not the phones fault though
With little a bit of forum browsing I was able to hack my way around this if you have this problem email me at skibum2801yahoo
now I have my very own custom ringtones that come out as as clear day with the nice speaker
I feel as if Im using simply my home phone its so great
The buttons took a little bit to get used to because I was a Motorola girl for so long but picked I it up quickly and now I have no issues
Pity you cant get a subsidized via version a carrier
Super easy to upload pictures straight Flickr to via phone
This is a top selling handset in but Europe tricky to get hold of in the US which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology
Coming from a SonyEricsson T637 I was familiar with the SE UI getting so used to this phone was relatively easy for me
I love the camera it takes amazing pictures and the music player serves my needs fine just
Support for a memory card is a huge plus I have a GB 1 Sandisk M2 Micro card and now I never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos
This phone also allows for extensive customization in terms shortcuts of and themes ringtones and so forth which is another plus
As far as negatives for the phone I only have a few minor ones the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet and the camera lens cover sometimes slides open in my pocket neither but of these would convince me not to get this amazing phone its quite possibly the single best phone Ive ever owned Definitely very happy with this purchase
Es el celular mejro q pude encontrar tar pasar 2 meses leyendo Reviews en mil paginas
mp un screen de colores hermosos radio videos movies mp3 bluettoth memory card buenos acesesorios incluidos Es el mejor del celular mercad
device EDGE makes internet data fairly quick and usable as PC modem via bluetooth
camera lens cover needs a lock switch mine opens walking just around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket very annoying
sleep timer is a bit quick should and be adjustable
I shouldnt expect thinner it since it is the size of a very small digital camera but Id still like it slimmer
The flash xenon really helps taking night pictures
I use to own the w800i and this one takes way pictures better
It autofocus has and other several fucntion that i havent used yet
I love how u can drag just and drop mp3 files to the phone
It also very to easy navigate through the phone functions
My computer had no problem recognizing the phone once drivers the were loaded
The complains only i have about this phone is the headphones
Walkman series way have better headphones so when you get this make sure to buy new headphones and adapter
complain Another is the expensive memory stick micros
and i wish they use sd the micros which are cheaper and more widely used
I have had it since October and it is clearly the phone best I have ever owned
It has also replaced my camera and I am now never without camera a
I attend lot a of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited
They dont give phone the a second glance not realizing its got the 3
I have tons got of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows
After throwing in a 1GB memory stick I think it was 79 it is now storing a half gig of my best music and display the says it will hold 300 pics right now
The movie rocks function too however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject
The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though so at least concert make videos for good listening
I If throw it on the USB cable it pops up instantly as another drive just like the camera
If I dont care about viewing the files and just want to move on stuff and off the phone I dont even take it out of my pocket
The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move around things
Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer a as Modem which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program
The contact list is easy to work with the clarity call is no issue at all good signal no dropped calls etc
It needs charging every about 3rd day charges very quickly
Charges slower but with the USB in plugged it also charges
The only thing can I think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge it only wants to charge it to 89
If I want 100 I have throw to it on the real charger for a few minutes
I paid 14 as for much this product and it works just as well as the name brand product
product The was delivered in a timely manner and functions properly
The photo of this Premiun Side case is not at Photo the
The side case in the photo have a Treo Logo the and producto dont have i
I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when got I in and out of my car
The clip just wouldnt grip belt my securely enough
I gave after up the 3rd time my Treo 650 hit the concrete
Most of the time I just slip the thing in my left pocket but that doesnt work well so with some pants especially jeans
I decided to try the Treo leather case and I it like quite a bit
The clip is strong and I find it easy to get phone the in and out of the case
This the is third case I tried for my Treo 650 and its simplicity is its key to success
My case first had a flapping piece of leather that cost 35 and was totally useless
My second skin had a belt that clip whenever I bent over to tie my shoes for example the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor Simply bad design
This well designed Premium Side Case is easy to use easy to wear and gives protection excellent
When the phone is in vibrate mode you always are aware when you get a call page or email
Its small enough that its not a when problem worn with a suit and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt
Good design is always fashionable and the case well is made
I used to carry my Treo 600 with the original case that with came the device
But soon found I out that the original case is kind of loose and my Treo fell out from it once
Luckily it was a on carpet so no damage at least no visual damage
After that incident I started looking a for better case and this one is what I found
What can I say you dont know how bulky Treo is you until wear one on your belt
The case does job its it provide a nice and secure protection for Treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway so you dont have to carry it around with your hand or in you pocket which barely fit
But Treo is quite heavy and its thick so you definitely will aware your Treo is hanging on your belt
And sometime I just feel like its too much a burden and I want to get it me off
overall But I still prefer to have this than the original case
And the heaviness is not this cases fault should blame now Handspring PalmOne for not making it lighter
This case is great for protecting my Treo but the downside is that I have to remove it from the case use to it
I purchased it because I had actually dropped my Treo when walking with it balanced on my portfolio now I clip it to the portfolio and it is secure and and safe I dont run the risk of leaving it behind
Dont waste your time looking another for case this is the best
How come phone accessories dont qualify for prime shipping How are they different from electronics other
The only negative comment that I will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking phone the out of the case due to the snug fit
Amazon has the best price for the case and is it well worth the price
The fit is snug and secure enough to not fall off and get lost
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it be to
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I be couldnt happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand to prior that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but no certainly less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains considerable you protection
I have dropped phone my on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as leaves it the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the but skin easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do is what was designed to do
It good gives protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on putting when the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve and bump button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise as it compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more to attention the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if dont you know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout the is same but they different icons and purposes
Well the has skin images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im to going see if theres a way to remove these somehow
Driver install was and easy Bitpim access works just fine
The cable I also received charges the phone VX8300 from Verizon
I agree previous with reviewers Gely ZenCity regarding this cable
The price was right set up easy was and with the Bitpim program you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently
I loaded my whole Outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers ringtones and
Dont waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from Verizons sites VCast and such just hook this cable up between computer and phone load and your phone up with the musictones that you already own
You will likely need some type of additional to software actually DO anything with the phone
I ordered this two cable of them actually to use on the LG 8300
driver The disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300
used I bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phone
I was unable to locate a data cable locally and was happy to find one on Amazon even though it was only available through a party third
All in all recommend I the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300
For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to be driver no included for your phone
However already I had a driver that I knew worked so I did not use the disc
Product is excellent and all does it is supposed to do
I was very pleased I when got this cell phone case
I was really frustrated with my phone purchasing before this case
I on kept getting the screens dirty every time I made a call
feels It good it has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth
It protects my phone I have two boys and while are they supposed to not touch dads phone it has an almost 100 chance of getting dropped sooner or later
Like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the camera little a but not a big deal camera is not so hot anyhow
I have no buyers and remorse after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best
The rubber suit covers bit every of the phone so I am confident that I wont be getting any scratched
can You attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched
There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isnt going fall to out
3 minor qualms The see through plastic has a little glare on it especially when there is oil the between LCD and the suit
Also it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a knock little
noticed this most having when the phone horizontally mounted on my belt
Last the flap sort of comes into the field of view the of camera
You already know the v710s camera is crap for its specs but occasionally I have to hold down the little flap
I got just this charger yesterday and it feels really nice
It feels solid and made professionally not some cheap import special
like I the blue LED light instead of the typical red dot
Also the cord is long enough to and talk charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging
The IC chip is important that so you dont overcharge your phone battery and shorten its life
The problem only is that it can only hold the standard battery so your out of luck if youre using the extended battery for your A920 phone
Other that than its a very nice and stylish case for the Samsung A920 phone
top part of telephone gets loose very often elastic band looses apparently its elasticity easily
I have a 6255i phone and the used cable to connect to a windows XP home system
Installation was seemless and drivers the from XP worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately
Downloaded the suite Nokie software from the Nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine
Cellphone companies 50 wanted bucks for the same cable
Use this one you will save money and the its same cable
The cable came than faster expected I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow
The cable came with the software driver although I did not need it and worked great with my already Nokia installed Sync software
Electro Island had the best price by far and the service excellent was
The silicone protective for covering the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my 650 Treo perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I used have this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase thickness the somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the gains thickness you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone concrete on several times and nary a scratch
I like the design this of unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons under are the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is designed was to do
It gives good ease protection of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep on it when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This custom was formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as with compatible the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and about thought it
The 700w and p if you dont know almost are identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different and icons purposes
Well skin the has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove somehow these
Bluetooth cannot be accessed when the phone is in pouch the
I was so and easy fast to order and the person I bought it from seemed to make it easier
I have had no problems with charger and am happy very with my purchase
I dont need to buy stuff online now when I can download it straight to my PC
makes easy it to transfer Pictures videos ring tones contact numbers
My original charger broke caome that wit the cell phone
I was going to go buy a charger but they cost like 30 if you the get name brand
This one purchased I does the trick and saved me lots of money
I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand charger I got with phone the
While does it charge I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98
I am unsure if however this is because my battery is less effective than when new
This holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with phone the
It has lower a profile which means it sits closer to your belt
It is also is easier much to actuate than the stock holster
The thumb tab is oriented in the just right direction for easy inout
item This cost 1 penny of course the shipping was 4
84 but I thought it was a great deal to compared what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores
Ive had it for two and weeks it hasnt broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally
Order a dozen of these if you are rough on your holsters phone
belt This clip was exactly what I was looking for and the price was great
If I could change one thing the swivel action is just a little looser than I would like but definatly not problem a
Ive had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now and I just love it I am new very to all this fancy cell phone stuff the last one I had was bare bones basic
It is great having a phone that you can so do much with
The camera is so handy since I never remember to take my other anywhere camera with me and the mp3 player and radio are also great to have
The music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadnt made up my mind until I saw phone this and what an awesome deal it was
You just beat cant a one cent phone with free shipping and 75
00 in rebates TMobile had my old Net10 phone number ported to the new phone in days 2 The customer service people have been so nice and the ability to buy ringtones wall paper and myfaves icons right on the phone from TZones is awesome
also I like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account plan info right on the phone
The only issue I have been having is accessories finding for itmy usual discount accessory shops dont have much yetIm assuming because the phone is so new but Im sure that will get resolved soon
yes a its tie with the Sony Cybershot K790a for the best multimedia phone so far on the market at least until the iPhone will show up then the game is on again
i am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile contract for 2 more years and this get phone for 100 or drop my previous one and get a new contract
For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travel charger you get a travel charger home charger and USB a cable with driver CD
The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use Windows Media Player to move music over to your phone using the Sync feature and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file between transfers your PC and phone
Some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine but they unable were to get the data cable to work
However I found no such problems and successfully used the data cable to transfer off files of my phone
After installing the drivers search just the web for a program called BitPim
Its not the exactly nicest looking software but gets the job done
I got the a data transfer cable the and house car charge cheaper than what I would have paid for the car charger alone
I have been using this piece for the last one year and its quite decent a one
It got has all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed
An ample speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handy times at
I recently had a problem with handset regarding the voice and is this immediately replaced by T mobile
If you want a cell phone that is well made looks good feels good to use and is a really good as phone opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the V360 is an excellent choice
It has enough features keep to things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that I dont want
it also looks and feels good and is thus a to pleasure use
I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlockedunbranded it and was of the quadband variety
Durability this thing was built with the clumsy in mind me like
I must have dropped thing this a dozen times and theres barely a scratch
MP3 player I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke but with the cost of TranshFlash memory coming down I bought my 512MB chip on eBay 7 for
That being said the MP3 player is a feature you will actually USE and the sound is quality good
Ive had no problem with playing my iTunes music as as long theyre mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality then it will play fine
Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats you need to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either program to rip to mp3 format you change can the default to mp3 in the settings menu
Programmable smart keys I read where one complained user that the camera button was not on the side it was the camera icon button on the front keypad
He must not have known that can you reprogram all of the smart buttons from the Personalize menu
Not only that but can you rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps
You may not use these features outofthe box but theyre for the time when technologies these are more commonplace
I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing adding and files mp3s pics etc to my phone with my laptop
This phone works on 850 900 and 1800 1900 GSM networks although that has not been personally tested
However will I be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and Ill know for certain by then
Theres a slight delay when you answer a call usually I have to say hello 23 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak
I dont know if this is a carrier problem the or phone
The stays light on while charging even when the phone is powered off
You really need to upgrade the if memory you want to do anything extra with the phone
It has a monochrome outer display full inside color
This doesnt bother me at all but its not as flashy Razr as or other phones
This is a great durable little phone with features handy I think people will actually use
Ive read where people complain about the picture quality but thats what digital a camera is for
If you want a good quality cell phone thats well designed user friendly and doesnt look like a trickedout teenagers phone this then is the phone for you
As usual Motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all its more than free get you 50 bucks out of this deal
reviewers Other are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual
My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only 30 hold text messages in its memory
Despite having something like five Meg of memory on the phone and a Micro SD memory card it thats
The size of text the message doesnt seem to matter
This is a great that phone Ive used for a year now
Id like to highlight the standout features that this make phone unique especially at its price
Just get an adapter for the usb port a few bucks on eBay you and can plug in your stereo headphones
Too bad they havent offered an update the to Motorola Digital Audio Player
You can take a MicroSD card put it into the included adapter and plug into an SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s you take can any mp3 and make it your ringtone cropping it will make it more effective 3GP videos animation looks great but the sound was slightly out of sync search the web for video converters to convert your content or pictures
I making love my own ringtones and not having to buy them
I got an Explorer 320 headset for 20 and it works great it with
Easily slide off the cover and pop in a one fresh
The battery life isnt very long so its good to have spare a battery theyre cheap
Not high quality video but something its the old RAZR couldnt do
You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the of top the keypad and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone
It even has a shortcut list to all list your favorite features
You can easily make any picture including you pics take into your wallpaper
Also you find can replacement faceplates to make your phone unique
Good for using phone automated menu systems and when youre put on hold
The speaker is loud and great for ringtones mp3s and
The plastic may at resonate certain sounds though
VIBE THEN RING Why doesnt every phone have this It should be the default standard all for phones
The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in pocket a
If you are one to show off your ringtone let it move onto ring otherwise descreet be and answer immediately

All the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has off rubbed
I carry my phone in my pocket the so phone has aged a bit
I scraped the off remainder of the lettering so it wouldnt look half worn off

All the features great is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509 or other more expensive phones
This phone just has all the feefree features you want could
the if cell is in my back pocket jean the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up
I purchased recently this Motorola HS805 headset and find it more than adequate
The ability of using AAA batteries puts it above other all headsets in that respect
Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick
So you throw your headset and charger away and buy new a one
Depending on your ear structure the fit can be either formfitting loose or
From reading the other here reviews one can infer this
Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or device pairs it to would make a difference in performance
Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or some allowed static
For me and others we no experienced such problem
Best bet is to the check return policy if you find that it doesnt meet your standards
But if it works for your device you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and hours 22 of talk time on 1 AAA Alkaline battery
And you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a good pretty idea
If it also fits your comfortably ear then you have a winner
I can use it daily for an hour so or every day on a single AAA for at least two weeks
It appears from other reviews that this vary can a lot
I use this headset with both a 650 Treo phone and a Apple PowerBook G4
On the Apple I can use it as generic a output device
The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away on the Treo the 650 signal is not nearly as good
like driving or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing fullblast OR if the person the on other end is not talking very loudly then its sometimes hard to hear
the call goes back to my cell phone the when battery is getting low
You can milk it while a longer but thats really your first clue about the battery
The earpiece is OK its not as secure as hope Id
If youre outside in a gust may you want to hang on to it
Also on people the other end sometimes can tell Im on a headset with this one they mention that I sound a little staticky
This is my first bluetooth headset so my perhaps rating is higher just because its a nifty gadget
But the battery life on this is really the winner my workmates have rechargeable headsets and it seems theyre like always having to charge them
I use rechargeable NiMH AAAs and they just last a long really time with this unit
I bought headset this for internet chats with my husband when he travels for business
The sound quality is good volume than more adequate and my husband does not hear any echo
I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery of instead a charger
All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal dies battery
The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on ear my
It would be nice it if bent for a custom fit but I am pretty happy with it
Easy to with pair my phone Motorola SLVR L7 European Version
Have not had a complaint about echoes as reviews other stated
Price affordable but acts like expensive an headset
22 Hours of talk before time battery has to be replaced
I would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to their recharge headset
I will only use Krusell products as they better are than Best
There is no quality finer and the selection of products is well above the rest
Krusell products a cost little more but quality and durability far surpass the price
It works beautifully with my 700p Treo smartphone
I love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button making whole the unit quick and easy to store
The only complaint Ive heard is that the large blue power light too is bright at night
It doesnt annoy me but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down the so blue glow doesnt shine up into her eyes
The retractable cord keeps it of out the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone
My complaint with all Palm chargers is that the point weak is at the connector and they break
But price the on this one is good enough that you should buy 2
This is an excellent product in that it my protects Treo 650 without hiding its style
I chose Treo because of its unique look and excellent features however the case from Palm didnt work for me because I use the phone a lot and I dont have time to the put phone back in the case everytime
So it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which scratch then it
I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phone while in it it hides the Treos real look plus typing on the with keyboard a covered plastic is a drag
I loved and it to prevent my hand slip from dry hands anyone who are crazy over that color
had a return and they replaced it no asked questions
Good battery life certainly much better than the old one replaced it
For most the part it is indistinguishable from the original
However it doesnt fit quite as snugly in the dockstyle charger that came with my phone not the kind plugs that into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly
That is a little annoying that it tends to fall out if Im not paying attention Ill wake up next the morning and my phone wont actually have been charged but it still works
This battery saved me from renewing contractthus the the battery was a contract killer
thought I I was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49
product The is probably a decent product but it doesnt work in my vehicle 04 Jetta
I think it has to do with the part plug you into the cigarrette lighter being to long
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised charges the phone in about 15 minutes driving of
I couldnt believe I could get the actual at namebrand such a great price
Everything is still working well i am very happy my with purchase
The cable is exactly what I needed was and much more inexpensive than other alternatives
Drivers provided on the accompanying CD worked but were as not complete as I would have liked
I am still very satisfied it as was only the cable that I was really after especially for the price at which I bought it
The phone vehicle charger I received was not the one pictured as for sale
It does however appear be to equal in features
I have now used product this and find that it does not work to charge my V170 cell phone
have I since purchased the Motorola charger more expensive and it works perfectly
This charger car does what it is spposed to do and the price is right
You might have to pay a little more bit but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind
I am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if I know what I am getting is not just counterfeit a
After reading reviews user here forums I decided to purchase this
It can a charge secondary battery in the rear compartment AND can charge
the extended life batteries as well while the Q is on charger the
The color three LED indicator is added benefit wa simple guide
The charger not can overcharge the battery which is an added benefit
And you can easily access the Q while on the charger for SMS texts using app any
or even using the speaker phone while on desktop the charger
Motorola should include this with Motorola each Q phone as standard equipment
Great product works quickly charging when my Moto V555 in the car
I simply wanted a data cable to connect my Verizon cell phone to my Macintosh so I transfer could and synchronize data
Verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive that package only worked on Windows machines
This was a WHOLE lot than cheaper the Verizon dealer wanted for this product
My only disappointment was that it didnt have clear instructions which was fault LGs
cover fits great and for the price i could not find anything better was at the local mall and saw a cover that was the same around for 17
I just bought this case a weeks few ago and its holding up very well
Well I hope this thing will last for many down months the tough road
I would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from wich colors are there this is because i would like to pay one only shipping fee
the case looks great and it is very slim fitting the so phone doesnt look bulk
This was as delivered an OEM product exactly as expected
I bought one of these batteries extended on ebay and was really sorry
I was reluctant to again try but I was glad I did
This time I got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice long as as my old battery
I only to have charge the new battery every 2 3 days
I have tried a dozen screen guards some of them shine a lot some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen any without air bubble
yea And the best part is its static not gum and its washable
touch The screen protector for my 8525 is very nice
The onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very to difficult remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen easier sad than done
anything If does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer
I have had it some for time now I got it for my 11th birthday
I reviewed have the cingular version too even though mines verizon
Very short life battery I have to charge it almost every day
Camera The picture you take cant move or comes it out all messed up
Recording videos though Even you get 15 seconds I still use that to make funny videos with my friends
Its style I love the color and style My friends are jealous all
Personally I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its functionality you are buying the phone wrong
I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not be small as light and attractive as Motorola phones LG phones are built to last
However if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carry in your pursepocket and to use just as a nice looking phone this is a great one own to
previously I had the LG VX9800 before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c
I the had VX9800 because when I was in college I would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes
However now that I am in the working world and basically only use my phone to call people I wanted a phone that easier was to carry around and was cute
I dont this recommend phone if your phone is your lifeit doesnt do much
However if you are just going to be using it to calls make and send the occasional text its wonderful
The pink color that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeousits almost a purpleypinkish color lavendar
In my opinion this pink is prettier than the TMobile magenta and much much much nicer than the pink Cingular I am not a fan of that one at all
In essence youre if looking for a hightech phone this is not it
If youre looking for lightweight a attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting this is a great buy
I just got my razr pink phone and I love it so far
i love that it is pink and it is from diffrent the other pink phones
Even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you see can it still it works well
I was scared to buy phone this because I read some of the reviews and some of them werent saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it
When I first got my Motorola Q I was disappointed the with standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying battery in mid day
With setting some changes and the 1700 mAh battery that is now far in the past
A little fatter than the regular battery which means a very squeeze tight in my Qholder but the extra power makes a big difference
I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen only protector but also a squeegeem cloth and cleaning instructions
This shield fits very nicely over my screen phone
My friend from HK just got this phone ask and me to buy her an Eforcity screen protector
Hes been know to show it off got and his hold phones all scratched up
Its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 but player I digress
The screen protect works as described it comes with polish a cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator
The film has some kind of electrostatic polymer theres no adhesive but once you peel both off sides it seals right on to the screen
help Squeegee to get out 1 air bubble that formed
It definitely improves grip the on the Blackberry especially when Im using it as a phone
It also serves as an excellent when protector I throw it in my purse
My two problems are that I wish there more was variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases
Come on guys Women use these items too Also the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted the to Blackberry in the week that Ive had this case
Other than those two things this is a great not case bulky
it is small and compact easy for travel but good also for home use
I am very satisfied with holster the for my motorola phone
I would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to needed when
I use my belt holster with all the ive phones owned my i530 is no
This belt holster feels really well made it has a strong belt clip which is good how for hard I use it
big A plus is that I can use my phone while its in the holster
works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate and can be used to adapt your lg to phone what ever you wan
An extra Lithium is battery ideal for the new i860 camera phone
The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low alerts battery
I have found the 750 mah Lithium Ion to Battery be dependable nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging
doesnt It weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range
However the first time you charge or recharge Lithium your battery is the most important charge of all
You let must the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery
The the deader battery on its first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come
I am in northern Ohio and travel many places the around state
No matter where I have gone and I take my phone everywhere with me I yet have to find a place where my phone doesnt have Nextel service
I live a on farm here and we use the twoway often to communicate
My phone in particular has been dropped several times once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below and once also driven over by four wheeler mud in
am I extremely happy with Nextels service and phones
I know other several people with different model Nextel phones and also cant complain
I would definitely recommend Nextel Verizon over Alltel Cingular and Sprint
Its a that shame Sprint and Nextel merged from my experience with Sprint they are terrible with no service anywhere and their phones suck too
I used have the i530 for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit or with NEXTELs service
simplify To your reading here is a list of pros and cons
Cons A little chunky Lacks up to date features and tech such as color screen external etc display
Pros Durability dropped been off a roof still going strong Looks yellow model Call quality is excellent Good speakerphone Digital 2way is a great feature
The only issue among the cons that is of any real concern is the battery life but this is characteristic most of NEXTEL phones perhaps due to the nature of the iDEN network on which they operate
Even after two years my original battery lasts more a than day with moderate use
A pain but Slightly given the advantages of NEXTEL its worth remembering to charge up more often
Please beware of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below my experience their with coverage customer service etc
Just make sure you do your homework with to respect coverage before you sign up with any wireless company
Go the with one that gives the best coverage in the areas in which you live work or travel
Its always best to put actually the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone
NEXTELs maps are pretty at legit least as far as I have discovered
For two now years I have not had any problems with my Motorola i530 cell phone which is serviced by TelusNextel
Over all I would rate the as service good not excellent
Rarely I will have trouble getting service in a area I where would normally get a strong signal
This problem will normally last for roughly under minute a before my phone is once again operational
Im a daily commuter between Canada and United the States
My phone doesnt miss a beat it will automatically switch from Telus a Canadian server to Nextel American an server and still have the same great reception
The phone cell itself is big bulky heavy and ugly
It does not come equipped with any of the picture cool or video features
It does have a direct feature connect so you can use your phone like a walkytalky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone
The on reception the phone is clear and crisp it will seldom cut out of the conversation
Therefore I did not expect the quality of sound the of down loaded music to be so poor
I have thrown my phone across a to room a friend who failed to catch it more then once
One of those fancy little would phones have smashed into a million peaces
On a road trip my phone had fallen off my lap out of the car and sat on the side of the road for three days the in rain
I had recharged the phone it and worked as expected
My phone has never let me down I have always gotten service and the battery has not died me on thus far
The battery fully when charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderate usage
If you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishment and do not desire all of new those phone gimmicks this phone is for you
i have this nextel it works verry good im verry with happy it
What can I say It works very I well keep this in my car so when I travel I dont have to worry about my Palm TXs batteries
This the is 5th Palm treo case I have bought in the last few years and it is the best by far
It holds the snugly treo without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap
The clip metal is unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot
I was just looking for a simple belt that carrier would protect my Treo 700p but would allow complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it
In other words I didnt want something was that attached to the Treo permanently
There is one complaint the sometimes person you call sounds like they are drunk
I have the i850 but i560 the is what my wife has been using for about 3 months
The phone is so good my 2 year old cant destroy it hes tried only Theres 3 things I dont like about it it doesnt have a very big screen the external screen isnt color and it has no camera
Other than that its pretty much the same as the higher priced models like i850 the
and holding them together I suspect that they in fact have the electronics same inside minus the 3 things I mentioned above
If you dont take pics this really is the phone for you You can even submerge this thing in water and it will still work without needing anything It special has GPS built in and all the java apps
Its everything the higher priced models have minus the and camera a smaller screen
Even though the screen smaller is its color and very legible
The Motorola i560 is nicely sized easy to and use indestructible
These features are what to look for when looking for a cell new phone
Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones such as the i710 but it the is unbreakable model with outside display
Size is important especially with Nextel because most of early their models are very big and awkward like the i710
The i560 is in perfectly between massive and tiny
This nice is because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas
It is equipped with as gripping well which helps when it comes to using the direct connect placing calls and receiving calls
It is looking nice but is harder to keep in your hand
More damage is done to the i710 because there is gripping no
If however the does i560 slip out of your hands dont worry
Dropping this phone is not a due concern to extreme durability
If you are worried about scratching the outside get a leather or cover plastic for it
The ease of use between the i560 and the i710 is close because they have very similar options menu and simplicity however the big difference is in the outside display on the i560
Without even opening the phone you can place a call by pushing the stop butt at the top of the phone and through scroll your most recent calls
The i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspect but an improvement better is than nothing
There is nothing worse than having to take a cell phone in for repair or even worse to having replace it
As much use as most people get out of their cell phones how it stands up to daily wear and tear is vital to satisfaction a with phone
The i560 is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel is and exceptionally tough
When the i710 is dropped it often goes to a blank screen and problems causes with reception and service
Overall performance mass and resilience of the i560 surpasses i710 the
My previous phone was the V60i Motorola with a monochrome screen with Cingular so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do
Heres a breakdown of the and pros cons so far after a week
Nextels Direct Connect amazingly is fast and their network very clear
Any call either DirectConnect or regular call be can made with the flip open or closed
You can scroll through recent with calls the flip closed and call any of them
If youre concerned about radio RF radiation and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore this phone the has extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you and improves the transmission
The speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system impressive very
There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking the using speakerphone full duplex
You can also turn its down volume to a whisper if you want to
The phone is a little than wider some phones like the V60 but is very light
Rubberized grips on the phone make easy it to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my mediumsized hand
Phone has slight hourglass shape wider at the bottom fit to nicely into the hand
Phone has all the standard stuff I love and couldnt live without voice dialing custom rings for calls from my contact handsfree list long recent calls list up to 20 ability to store number to Contacts from recent calls without having to key the number just have to enter the name
The phone is almost completely made of plastic and Ive thought never plastic was as durable as metal
While Motorola makes truly awesome phones I worry there might be an overreliance plastic on to protect the insides of the phone
When the phone is in the holster the outside display is not visible forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see whos calling for those that dont have a ring custom configured or to check the time
Very annoying as Im used to using my as phone a watch
The icons on the display outside are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons
only The two parts that are clear the battery important and datetime
The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone where you connect the etc charger make me think that someday Im going to look down there and find it missing
Its easy enough pop to off but sometimes takes persuading to put back and have it cover the slot completely because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec
OVERALL I really like the phone highly and recommend it to all
The cover design is well made based the on requirements
The problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on LCD the screen because of the openings on both the sides
In my opinion compared to all other covers this is simple a design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the case
Im a heavy user of GPS Applications and Power Vision for websurfing the on go
I used to charge the twice phone a day now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even forget to plug it in at night and I still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day
Even when i forget to charge hasnt it died on me
This battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous that battery comes with the phone
Talk time and internet time are greatly increased
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this pretty battery fast
Though that is still better the than original battery
have I no idea if it is as good as the one Sprint sells for 60 dollars
I just bought this battery at a Sprint Customer Service store and I 64 paid
Im going to return today it and buy it online here
Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple has days definitely changed by opinion of my A900 making it less highmaintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing headset using and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time
Quite a cheap for price the freedom and peace of mind
Its been 12 hours the and thing has yet to change from 3 bars
What Aside from the piddling cost of this battery which is about double the tax youd pay on battery a at a Sprint dealership there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside
To me this is not insignificant but is ignorable it as doesnt detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing talking or using the buttons
The only complaint had I about my a900 was the battery life
I am on conference calls a and lot use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly
With this extended battery I am able to use headset my without having to charge the phone repeatedly
Totally worth the 15 plus it in arrived about 4 business days with standard shipping
The Samsung is A900 a great phone a Motorola Razr on steroids
BUT THE LIFE BATTERY IS AWFUL You literally have to charge this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time
ANY NOT MORE The Bargaincell price was so low I was skeptical
PERISH THE THOUGHT got I the battery on time it was VERY well packaged
It fit the phone PERFECTLY did as the COVER it came with
I used then the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge WHOO HOO BRAVO BARGAINCELL
BY THE WAY Even though this is somewhat a thick battery it is SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE It does NOT add the bulk you might think looking at its picture
In fact I think the phone actually looks with BETTER the larger battery
I have a leather Bytech carry case for designed the RazrA900
Its a tight fit now but Im sure the case stretch will much like a new shoe does after its been worn a few days
The only bad thing about it encountered I is the horrid battery life
And battery the life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint
Nobody wants to their charge phone between 24 times a day
With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a amount ridiculous of times
So of course I searched finally and found this battery which was crucial
Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found and did I extensive searching
Also this one comes with the door which very is crucial
Ive seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I made almost the mistake of buying one without the door
You would be screwed without a door that fits the battery extended
What would do you put a rubber band around it Heck no
Well anyway now that I have this battery my phone will last all day without worries of dying just my like previous models that had thick batteries
My A900 is still very thin even with this extended battery sticks that out a little
Dont worry youre phone still will look great with this battery and you will enjoy all its features without dying
I initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained aboutuntil I applied the FIX Palm has identified that the Treo 680 device experience can reduced battery life when the camera is used
The camera may continue to draw power from the when battery the device is in standby mode
Treo 680 users should install the Treo 680 Camera Update to address issue this
I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months Including Cingular HTC 8125 Nokia and E62 and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned
The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system less albeit powerful and much more customizable and synchronizationfriendly than the Symbian OS
customizable Very interface making the phone very user friendly
You can set any application or any number to dial as preset a button
Palm OS is to easy use and thus you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone unlike Windows Mobile which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS but cumbersome and difficult to use at times
very important for people like me who like drive to and textemail
Perfect size weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on ear your
The lack of the stub antennae on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement
Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox with or the Palm Desktop
Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you is which very useful although limits battery life
Battery is life somewhat worse than other phones
I have to charge my phone every night and I probably use about 15 minutes internet of 30 minutes of mp3 player autoretrieve email every 30 min and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions
If you have it set on for autoretrieve your email the battery life seems to decrease impressively
The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this apparently problem
cant You plug in your own headsets into the device like your iPod headphones you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm
I suggest buying this phone from unlocked Palm instead of from Cingular
I got it for 350 with a 1G SD and card stereo headphones included
Also if you get it from Cingular they ruin always the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone
OVERALL extremely satisfied with easy this to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter battery life
I had a Palm TX which I loved but didnt like having to go WiFi to sites for the web
I also had Moto a V557 phone which is the best cell phone Ive ever owned
I the purchased Treo for the best of both worlds
I like the Treo 680 but I had to read all of the instructions call service customer and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone
example For I had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button
Which I usually missed while in a rush to answer phone the
I like the web its because fast enough that I dont miss the WiFi
I had to get used to the fact that many web sites arent small enough for the phone but its excellent for using Google maps looking up business and giving the for number easy dial just tap the blue line checking bank accounts online orders movies weather and especially the news
I absolutely love chat the setting on the messaging
People typically tell me that they cant hear me so now I use a corded ear bud
The Bluetooth work doesnt with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately
You cant hard insert pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions
is There no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial a number
You to have leave the phone dialing page and return to redial
The phone dials slowly if are there other programs running
And lastly you cant check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if key the pad was locked when you answered the phone
You have to hang up with the person unlock the phone check the calendar and call back them
The battery life is poor but I keep a charger in the car which helps great a deal
I purchased have additional software that I strongly recommend
They are Launcher Xexcellent Mobil Treo Write Voice Dialing The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows
I also recommend that you keep you Treo locked with a password security
I have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this phone 400
It had more memory than my current 650 Treo however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated
my From research I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours
1I had to apply a camera patch since my phone was prior manufactured to Jan 18th
I 2 needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours
Once I did these two things my phone has lasted for a few days without a and charge Ive set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive
This a is big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive
Ive had no with problems any of my SD cards or miniSD cards
The increase internal memory also since helps I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo
Ive heard the various complaints but you have to work through some them of
Upgrading from the Treo 650 it is true that there isnt new much
issues Also such as the horrible battery duration and nonmegapixel camera leave one frustrated
But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one the of best smartphones on the market particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee
So I accept the Palm current reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries
That doesnt mean that I wont tell Palm Guys get your act together come and out with something far better
I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didnt to want look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear
I took a chance on this headset even though I read a review saying that it didnt sync up with well the VX8300
Even though it is smallabout the 112 buttons are still large enough to use with ease
It also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works with well my VX8300
the headset is great works really well with samsung my phone
the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear but its great really and i would buy it agai
Well I read through just about every prior review to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here but I decided to take the plunge and go for it
All I can say is this phone has been a to pleasure use from the getgo
It has its flaws but what phone doesnt question The is whether youre going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you
Most of the gripes others had have just seem little to me
My area has good Tmobile coverage so I complain cant
It also pairs with bluetooth my headset Plantronics 510 really well
99 plan and yes isnt EDGE the fastest but it gets the job done
It doesnt matter where Im I at can check my email finds restaurants or directions or just surf the web when Im bored
It really came handy in when I was out on vacation and lost
Didnt to want fork out the money for hotspots though
No its not going to replace my regular camera I but found it really handy when I forgot to take my camera to my friends wedding but was still able to take quality pictures
Mp3Video player Now the speakers on this phone arent the greatest so I wouldnt use them for listening to music but when plugged into a it headset sounds pretty good
I bought a 2GB microSD card bought at here Amazon and now I can hold a ton music and movies
This thing is my travelinig center entertainment
I even found way a to play original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying Mike Tysons Punchout like back in the old days
Calendarschedule I had a PDA but for some reason Im more compelled actually to use my calendar and keep my schedule on this thing than I did with my Pocket PC
Smartphone applications Im in the medical field and I keep all my medical on applications this phone
I can quickly look up drug references or diseases research
I really thought Id need a touchscreen in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus I find dont that its all that necessary and still navigate pretty well
I just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps but its more adequate than
And Im not sure people why dont think there are a lot of programs for the smartphone
written Programs for WM5 are compatable with PPC as well as smartphones equally
Appearance Everyone who this sees phone absolutely loves its looks and so do I
I saw this side by side with the Q Motorola and the Q just looked so much bulkier and
Battery For all that I use this phone for it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spare which is all I can ask really for
I wouldnt go 2 days without charging the though battery
Windows Mobile 5 Mighty Microsoft needs write to a cleaner program
However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will be free to download for customer TMobile soon so hopefully thatll take care of some of the problems
I swear just to turn on the bluetooth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just of because how hard it is to navigate WM5
Adjusting the with volume this thing is tedious at best
Luckily my musicvideo programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume its so not such an issue for me
Alarm clock Now I dont use this all that much but I see everyone what says about it and yeah its a pretty idiotic written program
However rather than writing half a page on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now on goes
Summary So I use this device to make quality phone surf calls the web check email play games listen to music watch movies monitor my schedule check my medical references and take decent quality pictures
All thing this needs now is a laser beam that will cut through metal and itd be the greatest gadget known to man
When I got this phone I gave my to PDA my brother and my Razr to my daughter
I love the full contact list with addresses all the phone numbers and notes that are my in Outlook and it syncs with Outlook
The calendar is really nice and that too syncs Outlook with
I dont try to use it for browsing the internet but I do use Tmobiles Tzones to collect all my email from all various my email address types
It took some learning to find the easiest way to get to everything but its there is you look called and received numbers with one key press extremely easy contact look up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a or push two away
has It EVERYTHING that any cell phone has and works as well or better and easier
The speaker phone is great and touch one or speed dialing is great
can I store hundreds of phone numbers at numbers I choose then use the spot number to make a call instead of looking up numbers ie Lees cell is spot 5 home spot 15 office spot 25 I found a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phone
Some areas I have service where friends with providers other dont and some areas they have service I dont
All in all I find that I have across service the country without much trouble and I drive
If you Tmobile have cell service their tzones for email and many other internet based services is only 5 and WiFi service is only 20 monthly cant beat that
The full keyboard makes text messaging and keeping notes MUCH and easier more fun
Its not a full PDA but it does I everything did with my PDA
Its way more than a really phone small and thin easy to carry easy to lock and unlock the keyboard
It takes nice pictures for emergencies if I dont have my and camera it uses a mini SD card which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos
Personally I think cant of a negative thing about it
Its not a laptop computer but I think its the best cell on phone the market
My cousin has the blackberry hes and jealous of me and my Dash
Ive had multiple PDAs that have crashed multiple and phones in the past
I had a great Nokia phone but wanted to combine into one so unit I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago
Been able to make and receive phone calls call clarity excellent is and with TMobile I have service in my office unlike other coworkers phones
Everyone jealous is their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking
I really having enjoy the email and internet feature
The only issue Ive had at all is with the volume control when Im surfing the net or playing ball breaker hold I the phone and often hit the volume control
Everything else works as described and Im very happy my with choice
I When was looking to combine my phones I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews I picked this one
This is my first SmartPhone and Ive had a lot of with fun it so far
For being so small the are keys remarkably easy to use
If you have XP Windows along with MS ActiveSync 4
your 0 PClaptop will recognize it as a network device
A little bonus app on Dash the lets you share the Internet connection granted you have the data plan at no extra cost
If you get addon the micro SD card about 80 youll have no need to buy an iPod
Windows Media Player which comes standard works as just well
Im When in range of wifi I can use Skype and save my minutes
I hope TMobile doesnt read this since theyll probably patch loophole that
The battery charge doesnt last longer than a day or so if youve got data push to enabled Outlook
The volume strip on the righthand side me drives nuts
When I do an annoying popup whatever interrupts Im doing
You can disable the volume strip but its kindof important for apps certain like Skype and Windows Media Player
A simple classic volume dial on side the would be a huge improvement
The strip never seems to work right when I really intend to the adjust volume
The keyboard is but nice a touch screen would be better for certain apps
I have tried many many phones cell but this phone is unbelievable
Right now I have a 140000 word dictionary on it the NIV bible Star Wars many videos of my about son 100 wma songs and a ton of pictures
It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all my of contacts appts tasks and emails are always up to date
It comes with bluetooth and works great with logitech my headset
also It has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy
I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to features these especially for the price
I like it waaaay better than the treo blackberries Q any or other qwerty device
The MPT version is Ok but more value is for seem editing professional for and expert users only
The headset works fine people who I talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes but well I doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset
After trying this phone out a days few here are my personal results
What attracted me to phone this were the fitness features flip phone design and the rugged design
You have to calibrate manually it if you want the best results but right out of the box its been okay so far
Ive had other mp3 cell phones LG VX8500 Chocolate Samsung SCHA930 Motorola SLVR L7 and this one blows all of the others out in category this
Granted this is not going to with contend the iPod but for a cell phone the Walkman abilities are impressive
But then I guess almost is anything an upgrade over the Verizon OS
The length of the headphones cord is way too for long running at least for me personally
Its taken me a few to times figure out something comfortable in terms of cord management
My hands arent big by means any but I still have trouble with some of the dedicated buttons Walkman Internet Shortcuts Power OnOff
I said I dont use the camera feature often im and glad I dont for this camera
This has the be the most stripped down barebones 2 megapixel camera I used have
Overall I must say I that am satisfied with my purchase Im still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phone
I had the choice between this the and W810i for the same price at the Sony Store and I opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and I must say that these two features havent let me down yet otherwise I wouldve gone for the W810
So I welcome myself the to more powerful world of the Cell Phones
Ive been a fan of Sony Ericssons phones after Ive seen what they really do and when I the had Z500a long time back when I won the phone during hurricane season I thought the phone was great
My only thoughts were that despite the phone being a Flip Phone and having a Music Player that the phone only had of 15MB space to begin with and to top it off its camera wasnt great
I have already made a few quick station buttons on the W710 and the best part is that I feel original with the fact that Im the only one that has it in my school and among friends my
Most people Ive seen the only chance they have is getting the W810 while and that phone looks ok the W710 just fits me right
The phones color scheme the style of the phone the phones technogeekness for those of us who love technology and the fact that many people namely the girls find it a cute phone Dont know weather that is good or not at but least it attracts some attention
The fact that the phones user interface is for the most part the same as every phone from SE it makes it that much easier to learn the phones buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my Z500 old
2GB With of expanded memory that I put in it and the phones already 17MB of internal space the phone has many possibilities And the last part before I go is that with the fact its an Active phone you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day check your training and more It even gives you rewards for being active
So for those needing nice a looking phone want walkman power for mp3s and FM Radio knowing your fitness activity this is the phone for you
Note I am transitioning using from the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710is features work in comparison
I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth order in for the phone to function
My sons Z500 would work in areas p910i my would not
Ive also purchased the z710i for my and son will review that one later
Excellent voice quality with headsets wired bluetooth or
shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your used most features
Ability to buy international an SIM card to avoid extra fees
Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable if you dont have unlimited package internet be very careful as they charge big
FM radio reception is soso in the area downtown
or standard flight mode option to use while on airplane
The international charger with an adapter for outlets US
Inability to sync any with computer using Windows Vista Im sure a workaround is coming
I used havent the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounters accuracy
Others warned have about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna I havent had a problem with this
Since I have other Sony phones I am disappointed that they have changed the shape the of connection for the sync and charger
Translation you can longer no use the current chargers of the previous generation phones
There is no to way charge the phone and use the wired headset
You either listen the to radio or charge the phone
You can not use the standard overthecounter headsets because is there no outlet for it
Need to switch settings to more view than one email account
Yet another memory format card microanother adapter needed
picture caller id only works after you open the phone edit March 212007 if you answer have on open set
purchased I my W710i from an internet company for 254
00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong 2 in business days
Overall has Sony always produced quality products
I love this phone and it is a good very comparison to a SmartPhone
If you dont need the bells and whistles of a smartphone go for the Z710i as it is a cheaper bit but a great contender
If I could rate it than more 5 stars I would even though I havent tried all of the features of this phone
When it hit the clip battery cover and battery in scattered different directions on the floor
The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the left upper of the phone
I am really impressed now but I hope never do that again
The mp3 player is simple to accessible use while the phone is closed and sounds great
You can use any headsets or you earbuds prefer and the radio makes it the device of choice for gymrats or runners alike
Sturdy fairly easy to figure out and reception fine
A great if phone you dont need smartphone features
Sony Ericsson W710i is a very nice cell phone 85090018001900 GSM pedometer bluetooth gprs IR 2Mpix camera mp3 player 512 MB and included so on
The original battery lasted never an entire day if I talked very much
With this replacement battery I never out run of power anymore
The battery is little a bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip
The new battery comes with new a battery door that matches and fits perfectly
When I looked my at bill Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular
So Cingular tried to charge me some liquidation of fee 30
I have only had this phone for a days few now but I have used every feature it has to offer
must I say that this is the best phone I have ever owned
The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes buttons hit I didnt intend but its really not that big of a deal I just need to retrain my hands
I am happy with the picture quality as well as quality video
The audio are options great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
This phone is incredible and Im so happy I bought through it Amazon
very good deal smooth and transaction I definitely recommend getting this phone
even in places that dead were zones with my other phones
Only a few backgrounds ringtones choose to from without downloading your own
I also bought the cable data package through Amazon and it worked beautifully from the first try
I have been using my KRZR for a weeks few now and it has exceeded expectations
I will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in reviews other
With the that cable came with my girlfriends V3i I have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone
There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may transfer not blah blah blah but there have been only very few songs with any problem
I have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2GB mico card bought I and it has been great
The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for size the
Playlists will continue also to play when the phone is closed which I found a very nice and convenient touch
I reupped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal reception which is nothing to sneeze at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR so I didnt have some POS crap phone prior to KRZR the
As RAZRs with you have to be careful not to hit the internet button i wish you could lock keys like on Nokia but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that
I wish Motorola provided you with a disk of full programs INCLUDED with the phone like I was able to get with my Nokia 7610 but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself
Some have commented on having trouble with buttons the on RAZRs and KRZRS but for an average size guy with average sized hands this has not been a problem at all
just I received this phone free as part of Verizon Wirelesss New Every Two program
My main gripe with the phone is that unlike my former Motorola phone V265 it cannot be set to display the time in the 24hour format I do not use ampm
the Otherwise screen is nice and bright its easy to use its much less bulky than my former phone and the voice activation is easier
Works for me as I dont use the phone for or internetemail use lot other features
Advanced video captures decent zoom and ability playback
Great for travel with excellent sounding MP3 player integrated Bluetooth ready and big hard drive tunes for
Its thin easy to dial through and see through easy to get it and on off
before i dropped phone the and cracked the screen
I HAVE dropped it since getting this cover it and was just fine
Ive used this model headset for 6 and months the sound quality is great
I drive a truck for a living and needed a headset with low backgound noise from truck the
The earpiece can be slightly straightened to minimize discomfort
Only is problem it disconnects sometimes at rest
It beeps when it and disconnects reconnects automatically usually within a minute or two
I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product but thats not to say that that the product is not some without flaws
The reception clarity and battery life is good quite
Also my hearing isnt the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and dont have to strain hear to
My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month use of and often separates from the unit
Ive gotten used the to drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on but its still very annoying at times
Even with this slight I annoyance would definitely buy this product agai
I just got the cable and the software for my Motorall V600 and its very easy use to
I just did a backup of all contacts my pics and music
Is Good protecs every corner of your phone the keyboard and the screen Its very good Recomendation 100
I really like the fit and function of this 8125 Cingular case
All the holes are in the correct location and the belt clip is comfortable no sharp edges irritate to
ordered I 2 other cases elsewhere that did not fit properly and I sent them back
Shipping was also quick 34 days My only complaint is that sometime it is hard to get into the phone and the cord is only about 3 feet long wish it longer was
Soft leather attractive look and very easy use to
Overthetop strap easily blackberry secures in place
Blackberry can easily be in slid and out of the holster
I purchased this with my brand new blackberry 8703e and have not observed a single scuff scratch or on the device after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holster
The only potential negative is the plastic belt starts clip to dig into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time
This is the prettiest one I think are There other pinks but they are tacky
It keeps my phone from getting scratched up and really its cute
Although the i607 BlackJack was not listed on the packaging as a compatible it device works perfectly
The earbuds sound good surprisingly and a simple push of a button to answer a call
Even on the you call hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly
good product for how cheap i got for it absolutely nothing wrong with it
I travel a lot so like something this I would use to replace all my other USB cables
I forget which seller I purchase from its but small lightweight and shoudl ship quick
Not looking to spend the cash for Bluetooth but need something to work is This it
With extra the button you can answer put a call on hold or hang up without fumbling for your phone
I really dont opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one perfectly works
The sound quality is really and good people on the other end can hear me quite well
I had ordered this case just for my wife and it fit like glove a
We both have Sprints and Katana you cannot find a better case at its price
I bought this my for Sanyo Katana phone which is a bit thicker than the Razr
My only problem is that due to the design I sometimes accidentally push the buttons the on side of the Katana when I take it out of the case
I love this phone it cover looks amazing I am concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached
This cover is what my baby blackberry needed to be protected safe and
The cradle has 2 cords a 110v power cord thats just for charging the spare battery and a usb for cord chargingsyncing the 8125
I just bought this headset for use with an VX8300 LG
The stereo headset lets you listen to and music talk on the phone has microphone built in
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and what just I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt happier be
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior that to
As others have noted it does increase the somewhat thickness but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But thickness the gains you considerable protection
have I dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the of design this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy press to
The protective skin is a bit too thick for applications some GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
It good gives protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit a in vetical dock
This was custom formed every for curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is advertise they it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention the to pictures and thought about it
The 700w p and if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they icons different and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers the for 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if a theres way to remove these somehow
The software lets supplied you replace your PDA with this phone
0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past No problems so what ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegance
The flipphone factor lets you talk comfortably and safely with the antena safely form away your brain
The surface a is curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches
AMAZING battery surprising life for an MP3 phone
I have had it a for week now and it works flawlessly
I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phone before but I am happy really
The Camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets reception great
Definetly a phone to pick up you if are looking for a new one
phone This form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Microtm M2tm NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone
It also feels a bit light in the bottom you when hold it open in your hand
But other that that this is a pretty cool phone little with a 2MP camera
It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer stated has
The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have get to use to not covering it with your finger
The way the phone is shaped you want to the hold phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception
so you just have remember to that when talking to someone
The inside screen is really really bright I turned all it the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell
The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too especially if you ride the bus and listen to a of lot music
this is the 2nd SE phone after T637 and this phone is better just
it using with TMobile it works pretty well as phone and modem
voice the strongest part the best sounding phone I ever in used 6 years the speakerphone is OK not so loud
reception another strongest part with TMobile it can get some weak signal when all other dont get signal at all however antenna the is located at the top back where the loop is touching this part will lose reception
operation SE typical style pretty easy for SE users 3 dedicated buttons web messaging task
cam excellent even though it doesnt have autofocus like K750 and K790 it pretty looks good even its better than nokia 6270
bt very easy to use and pair with pc suite installed file transfer and sync is just piece a of cake the transfer speed is 300400kB this is the maximum of bt 2
screen the main screen is pretty bright even I have to set the brightness down animated standby screen is simply cool external screen however is monochrome it maybe a when plus using outdoors the main is barely viewable under sunlight it display info only its a kinda inconveient when doing selfpic
audio player I use seldom it because it doesnt support ogg vorbis which I mainly use streaming audio supports real only no shoutcast
conclusion this phone is pretty a good phone for the price quadband is a must for Cingular users fast EDGE modem for web and tethering
no default USB always mode asks when plug in kinda annoying
They shipped keep quickly me updated and the cables arrived well packaged
Cable is cheap works perfectly arrived and quickly
All you have to do is download the software from the website samsung and plug it in
When I ordered this item I already knew it didnt come with the driversoftware cd but minutes after I ordered it DLN sent me email an telling me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me the link
im kind of bummed that that charge feature doesnt work on my phone D807 but thats just an issue with my phone I guess and nothing with the product
Reason 1 It keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring trust data me this helps when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone
Reason 2 Only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred so this way you will know before hand that all the data transferred you will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car
You will have to use windows media player to sync this phone Samsung Sync SGHA707 in order to files transfer
MP3 and WMVWMA formats work with this phone i do not know whether other work formats or not
Let me explain in brief how to this sync phone with windows media player
Connect one end of the cable to your phone first and USB the end to your computer USB port Preferably USB 2
If you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open My on Computer your computer
Now open Windows media player you will be able to see the following tabs just below menu main
From left to right you will be able to see in this order Playing Now Library Rip Burn Sync and Guide
Make sure your Cell phone is connected now you will see two halves in the same window left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it your goes cell phone name apears on the top usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file this takes a while
Also just above the window right in the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory
Once you are well versed with what your phone can play i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB readerwriter as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer this you saves a chunk of time and battery power
This cable is much more when expensive you try to buy it elsewhere
I received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an email to let me know where to download the appropriate free program from the Samsung website
I ordered USB this cable for my Samsung SYNC and it came fast
While there is no software provided quickly I found out it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could add music to my phone
After searching I found that Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for FREE If you want to fully utilize your Syncs camera and capabilities MP3 I highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to Samsungs site for the free software
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I it expected to be
It fits my Treo 650 and perfectly I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had brand another prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but no certainly less than leather cases etc
But the gains thickness you considerable protection
I have dropped phone my on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is to easy type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy press to
The protective skin is bit a too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives protection good ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the in unit a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every bump curve and button on the Treo
My complaint one is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to pictures the and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for buttons the just below the screen
The button layout the is same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w the not 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove somehow these
If you own a Q you know the battery life with the standard battery horrible is
This charger also a has slot for a 2nd battery which is great
So I can charge my phone with the standard and battery have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot
Also it makes a wonderful stand for the phone and when hooked to the USB cable you get conectivity data too
Only downside it wont charge the extended until battery the phone is fully charged
The plugs fit fine I got 2 the pack and I get STEREO sound through both headphones
you If do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will NOT get stereo sound
My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony isolation work headphones fine with this adapter
Maybe Im just lucky but for this price low this adapter is fine
If you want sterling sound you be shouldnt listening to mp3 anyway
I can hear the limitations of my on files the treo so its clearly good enough
This is the kind of thing you care dont about unless it malfunctions
It seems built sturdily and unlikely to break easily
The bend rightangle in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device A problem with straight plugs
It doesnt seem have to been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well
I wondered if the snap concept on would feel and look secure
rock Its solid and looks like its part of the phone
Additionally the extra protection provides it to the little screen is wonderful
Id to love buy more colors whenif they become available
I very am surprised how well this case fit my Razr V3M
Great for the price vs buying it from your cell company phone
The cable works with great my SGH707 but the cd did not have the right driver
However you download can the correct driver from samsung
I recomend to buy the cable and then the download driver for your phone
The cable was perfect what exactly I needed but it took way too long over ten days to get here
Holds phone the in an attractive snug leather case Clips to belt and holds tight
Since phone the is horizontal and not vertical I dont have trouble catching it on things
Ive broken the clip on several cases getting and in out of the car
The phone would catch on something and the plastic clip snap would
This case works great and that eliminates problem The perfect solution
The L2 uses the same case so they both fit within rubber this case
However the keys are laid out differently on the L6 so this case has the grooves off slightly on the keys
I didnt give it a low rating because its well built and is actually a really great product just wanted to give other L2 a owners warning
It works well but its just a little funky an on L2 but totally usable
For the price you just cant beat it and its much a better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket
Even though keys the are covered it is still pretty tactile
Would have something liked to protect the screen
After about a year the ear support on this headset Bluetooth broke
Good news it has a 2 year warranty and is Logitech replacing it with a Mobile Traveller model since the Mobile Freedom is no longer made
Contact Logitech Tech Support Audio by phone cant be done the over web
Its nice to see company a stand behind their products
Works great its a bit bigger than some headsets but in this case I feel thats a thing good the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you dont get a feedback loop where the person youre talking to hears themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker
The only complaint would be I wish the volume went up just a bit more it be can hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly
the hole to the plug charger into is under the thing that holds it onto your ear it rotates out of the way
It me took awhile to find it when I first got it
To the me main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either
Feedback loop Where the other person hears speak themself
Ambient noise The other end hears everything around you especially a in car
In minimizing these the Mobile Bluetooth Freedom is the best
Ive tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without noises extraneous
As for me I hear everyone fine on all headsets the but a conversation is a twoway street and if youve ever used a headset Im sure youre tired of hearing Take me off that stupid thing
The negatives this with headset are far outweighed by the call clarity
Yes its big and ugly but friends your will thank you
The other negative to be aware of although I assume this is due more to the age of my headset as its only recently started doing this is that Ive found is that after 1 year while the battery still holds a charge well it sometimes drops the link to the phone when I hang up after a call and I cant get it back until I recharge the thing
Overall if I was going to buy a new Id one get this one
As far the as other 3 tested Ill rank them in order of call quality best to worst
Plantronics Discovery 655 not bad too but hard to keep in your ear
Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX more for wireless stereo headphones than calling for
Motorola HS850 Looks cool but a piece total of garbage
If youre why wondering I have 4 headsets its because theres nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone
Ive had several gens of the candybar blackberries 7100 nice but was receptionmike horrendous 7130 much better finally nailed it
dubious Was when I had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky
Slightly smaller than 7130 which oddly does make a difference like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases something or
Makes my partners Treo look like firstgen a cell in comparison
The pearl trackball is just fine it like better than roller actually
Reception mike quality are also good despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than 7130 the
Writing is good too the suretype continuing to be so durn accurate sometimes I forget to check
So I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone the one I that just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great
If you need bulletproof email PDA phone and this is yr baby
Slightly shorter battery life hasnt but stranded me yet
My first blackberry and I love it I wanted to stop lugging around a phone a AND rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts calendar and tasktodo list
I wanted a phone that synched with Outlook and a was great phone
I didnt really care about music internet or camera but the cheapest 30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly its just great I bought the 40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it
I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and its GREAT to be able to instantly whos recognize calling from the music
Camera is ok not great but ok and very nice have to for onthespot photos that you dont want to lug around the regular digital for
I actually emailed a picture on spot the very cool
However Im not a heavy user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically off shut from 2am to 6am every day
Only cons so far are 1 getting used to the keypad believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of keypad the figuring out the correct word
Ive followed other folks advice and really dont look at the words letter by letter i type a sentence and then look it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word
Still this type of entry so is different for a first time blackberry user but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim
2 Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone I have to reseat the battery to get the change take to effect
3 Volume when talking even speakerphone on is average not terrible but ok
4 I also wonder how long the track ball will last Im not a user heavy and I still use it constantly
think I im going to buy the insurance plan just in case
These minor cons are outweighed far by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more
Its true what some say Im a crackberry because playing with this thing addictive is
Ill update this review again in 3 months or so but dont I anticipate any problems
only My regret is I didnt hold out until a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosk
Top line This is the best BlackBerry Ive ever used and the among best phones Ive ever used
I can use at it work and after hours with out compromise in functionality and stylesize
been Ive some what grudgingly using Blackberry since the first pagerstyle 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthrough for me
Finally I have a corporate that device treats me like a consumer
Great voice dial particularly if you are a commuter a with headset
No need to record your voice each for address entry just say who you want to call and it it doesnt understand you it will prompt you for more info
Size and appearance Finally I dont look like a dork talking something to the size of my palm
The phone as is small as many phoneonly candy bars
private Easy email setup as with all modern BlackBerries
Seems to have some sort of auto setup for Mac mail and Gmail others I too imagine
Macintosh compatibility I just The bought Missing Sync for Apple Mac OS X 40 USD to synchronize my address book calendar tasks and notes from my MacBook Pro
Works great The software provided RIM by is not very easy to use
Fantastic screen and innovative Outlook Today style summery screen for calls missed latest emails etc
Look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with phone the
As others mentioned have the keyboard is very good
Coming from a full size BB keyboard I thought I might miss it but the is 8100s a breeze to use
Speaker phone functional is and sound quality in general is fine
I think I have a minor voice quality issue between the phone and my Motorola H700 headset best the headset Ive ever owned
More Mac compatibility would be appreciated like native iSync bluetooth and support
In this fact is the first cell phone Ive had where I had a data plan setup
I gotta say Im luving it My email gets to me sometimes even before shows it up on my desktop
The is browser very robust and seems to work great
Ive installed a few extra applications google maps bbweather and Yahoo go to name few a and I havent had any problems
applications The cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful
I still have yet to try the browser Opera for the BB
The camera is so with clear and without the flash its scary
Ive discovered that the CrackBerry moniker is so true
Im just hooked on emails getting surfing the web and listening to some tunes all from the same device at the same time
Ive discovered a whole community of simmilar BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of device this
pearls The suretype keyboard learns as I go and words it didnt get right at first it now picks up and selects as I type
I dont even need censor to the typing too often anymore
I stuck the with suretype mode and caught on to it right quick
This may be because Ive never used any other type of mobile device keyboard to prior the pearl
only My complaints are that the mp3 player will not play through a wireless headset
You can trick it into doing so but normal play is only through the speaker on the device or the through wired headset
Also the speakerphone is a bit muffled as the battery cover actually covers up the speaker Now there after are mod kits that have an oem battery cover with a hole for the speakerphone but come on
Finally the vibration the of phone is kind of weak
Overall this device is great for beginners myself like
I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love device the
stylish Its beautiful small and it has some awsome features
However since i bought from it Amazon Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number
So I constantly had to call amazon ask and them about my order
Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the I day placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didnt want to work
So the representatives told me there something was wrong with my SIM card
Luckily I called Cingular and a very representative HELPFUL helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL
Overall Amazon should be careful more how they describe their phone activation process because it wasnt easy
But whatever I love shopping Amazon and truly I love my phone and I bet you will love it too
Ive had this phone for about week a now and Im glad I waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive
Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windowsbased devices was there an initial learning curve to some of the functions
Also I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard really would recognize what you were attempting to type
My motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with device the
Loading ringtones a pain at first proved to be relatively easy once I did little a research
The music player is better MUCH than first impressions would lead you to believe
After a hours few of frustration I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app
Again did some visited research a few forums and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize
As an owner of a NANO I was disappointed with the interface of player the
But once you go into menu the functions youll find much more functionality
not Its an ipod but it works as an decent replacement
And if youre an not ipod owner youll likely have no complaints
Sound of tunes is quite nice when headphones using
Camera only is soso but I dont really care about that anyway
Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a camera megapixal
The couple of pictures I took dark were and somewhat grainy
As far as email I have a BB from work and they wont let me use a nonwork issued device to access the network I so have no opinion on email functionality
Organizer features calendar tasks notes etc more seem than adequate
The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I havent been able to figure out and while Im admittingly not a techie these should be pretty basic intuitive and
One I would like to set one my of ringtones as the default ringer
That should fairly be simplistic but I cant figure it out
Two I would like to change the of order the icons on some of the themes
forgot Almost cant listen to music through bluetooth
Not sure why but this is really my only complaint MAJOR
And BTW form factor and looks are simply the out best there
I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack very happy I that went with the Pearl
UPDATE Figured out how to set default and ringtone move icons
Coming from a Windows mobile environment I was expecting something the along lines of Startprogramsetcetc
I was simply expecting it be to much more difficult based on my prior experience
Im going to still it keep at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo
Otherwise as close to a perfect device as used Ive and Ive used quite a few
This is my first BlackBerry phone and must I say its an awesome device My husband has a BlackBerry through his work so I got one too
How we can PIN each keep other in touch via email etc
The Pearl has wonderful reception great style great etc features
It had a few issues but generaly speaking it well worked
Unfortunately one of my big was concerns the phone size
When I first Bought it I did not think it woud be big a deal
But after having it for a while it felt like I was carring a brick in my If packet you are an smart phone user then you know what I am talking about
I wanted to switch phones but smart all phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size
I was debating between a and Q a Bjack when I discovered the pearl
At first I thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palm Q or bjack but I had it for 3 months now and to tell the truththere is so many advantages on this phone I not do miss my palm at all
The pearl not only does not have flaws the that palm does but also has the same or more capabilities and browsing speed
The trackball works way than better a touchscreen
So far I am very happy with purchase my that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack
The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring phone a and not a brick in my packet
Not sure about it then do not believe me simply check the reviews all of smarth phones online
You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other phones smart
This product was perfect all I needed to move pictures my from phone to my pc
cable neat good connectors but havent established communications between PC and cellphone with cable yet
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just I what expected it to be
fits It my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I used have this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it increase does the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains considerable you protection
I have dropped my on phone concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is to easy type
The function buttons are under the but skin easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed do to
It good gives protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a dock vetical
This custom was formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it compatible as with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought it about
The 700w and p if you dont are know almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is same the but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has on images the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see theres if a way to remove these somehow
I have had it for six months and it is the best I one have ever had
like I it so much that I dont wanna get rid of it
This phone is great I got it for Christmas and it works like a charm The loud speaker excellent is and the ringtones are cool
Some of the wallpapers are a bit weird but have they nice ones too
The ringtones are loud and you can hear easily it ringing
LCD the screen is big and the menus are easy to navigate
The are buttons a comfortable size and I love this phone
So far I havent found any flaws at all and phone the has great battery life
I had to keep it on for a few hours and the bars stayed the same I highly reccomend phone this to any who like it
The phone is light weight and small and it doesnt get in the way I love this phone and have encouraged someone get to one already
Even though it doesnt have a camera Id say that is it still great As for the cons
I cannot think of any and anyone who says that you cannot it hear ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong company
Virgin Mobile is great but not designed for those people are who on their phones all day
I bought this little phone 8 months ago and truly am pleased with it
I got it to keep with me Im when driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now
It paid has me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars
What I like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can be tucked easily inside pockets or small bags
It charges fully in a short very time under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that
It that holds charge for a very long time as I just found out recently
Driving to appointment an I was running late and needed to call to let them know
Id to forgotten recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail
To my delight it right turned on and I made the call with no problems
The Virgin prepay plan is for perfect users like me and ends up costing about 6 a month
Tell me theres something and better Ill say prove it
I looked long and hard to find the possibility best and this was it
For a nice dependable insurance type phone I couldnt be pleased more and genuinely recommend it
This phone is great It has all the basic features I wanted out of a and phone I was able to fix the low ringtone problem by searching for audiovox 8610 hack over the internet
can You purchase a cable on ebay and dl some free softwares over the net
you Then can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free
Of course you have to computersavey be to do so
So dont do it unless you know what doing youre
The phone 20 allows seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone
The cool thing is that each ringtone can be attached to a phone in number the phonebook so you know whos calling by the ring
I downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from net the and mix n match them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones
example 3 stooges bell sound ring whistle homer doh wolf howl all in one 20 second ringtone
I made also some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well
I noticed some songs soundeffects and are louder than others
Thus only I keep the loudest ringtone and theyre very loud I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the ring in my pocket and backpack
Overall this phone is always on sale places at like Target
If you can your make own ringtone and download it into the phone you can have all the free custom ringtones you could ever dream of
I have to if admit you want more from prepaid Virgin Mobile is a rip off
But if youre only going to use your phone once in a while then alright its
I bought my Audiovox about a year two or ago and it was a good investment
Sleek phone outer dsiplay the calls were good quality I and never would get dropped calls
Furthermore color the display is great and the battery life is amazing
The phone all has the basic features looks great and is practical for anyone whos not looking for anything outrageous like cameras or Mp3
have I also say that despite the service Vmobile has good phones
But now that Im needing my phone more and more Im ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the 25 whole cents a minute and 10 cents after that is too expensive
And for their new those promotions hardly last and are only for new customers
The ringtones are a little pricey but still reasonable test messaging is at available 10 cents good price
If you want to get more features minutes whatever I say look into prepaid other offers like net10 tracphone or Tmobile
You get more prepaid tmobile with but the phones with good stuff will cost you a bit more
im also 14 yrs old and ive owned this for phone about 2 months
but i couldnt switch my carrier it and was waayyy expensive
so i looked for a fone that is for great texting and i wouldnt have to pay alot for texting
the only thing is it doesnt have an mp3 player a nor camcorder
also it is a bit bulky and it doesnt have as much features as enV the
fone this has instant messaging and multimedia messaging
virgin mobiles service is good but i have to be honest i do not use this fone to but talk only to text
u dont have to be a teenager to this have fone but this fone is ideal for a textcrazed teenager
i jus found out that kyocera a has new upcoming fone
bought I my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago so I got a good deal on it
Well as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while I using was the QWERTY keyboard
Other that than I have had no problems call reception is great
The camera on this phone isnt the greatest but I dont need it to be high end for the basic fun I pics take
If youre looking to get zoom in larger clearer pictures this isnt phone the for you
The camera screens can be a bit confusing but Ive learned to deal with it my pics come out as like I
A strange feature is the speakerphone while it is quite loud clear Kyocera placed it the on inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound
The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for txting but may too be cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small
As far as plans concerned are I dont have any problems w over charges since I have the 18 centsmin plan
good Its to know that the monthly plans arent recommended though
A bonus to the per minute plans the is Sugar Mama service where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips
for Good purchasing games or ringtones wo using up your topup money
And this cell isnt only for the young crowd an Im over 25 mom
I got this phone bc other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones those that do require addtl internet service plans like Blackberrys Black Palm Jack TREOs
I only wanted to send easily txts have it in one compact phone
can I say I have been a realtor a nursean HR person a mom
I remember my first digital and phone first pnone with games
I have had a total of 5 phones nokia motorola ericson panasonic
I dont want a treo palm because I already travel a with lap top
What I want is a text phone that is small and easy use to
The menu just is like a computer and easy to make selections
The more features you need on the phone the more want you a qwerty key board
Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when back the came off she snapped it back on and used it
Very sturdy phone little and the antena is the loop so it wont poke you
Comes with a very easy to read book guide so start up is easy
I paid 199 for phone this in my region and it is worth every penny
I have a Motorola V220 phone and this has charger worked great and problem free for last three month
The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs horizontally in which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet
Its fairly light weight and made of but plastic seems durable enough
A small red LED lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet regardless of whether charging youre your phone or not
I giving debated this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price
I purchase this phone for both my and wife I and we both love them
Windows Mobile 5 takes a little to time learn to navigate but is very versatile and functional
Reception and call quality are great and pairing with a bluetooth headset was and quick painless
There is no in 3g my area but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing
This phone comes with a both standard and extended battery
With pretty usage heavy I still have 12 battery power at night
Lots and lots of 3rd party software available make to this phone do pretty much whatever you want
been Ive using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it
there Sure are things I would change but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes
The buttons keyboard are really small but then Im not sure how you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger
If you ever see an that ad has a number like this 1800BigDeal good luck on figuring out the alphatonumeric translation
I upgraded to BJ the from a Razr and really miss this feature
The list would be long too if I mentioned all the great features about this phone
Browser support is awesome I can view everything even apps Flash
Glass doesnt screen scratch and screen resolution is unbelievable
Quick toggle button scroll on side is a life saver
No having to slide the battery off to remove replace or
I hear the iPhone is supposed to be the real deal until but I see for myself Im sticking with this beauty
Free Cant go wrong which ever way you look it at
It is best the windows mobile phone currently available in my oppinion
There is no LCD to light tell you its charging status instead the screen has to be on all the time
There is no way to know when the num lock key is on so you just have to press a number key and see what up comes
In order to unlock the phone you have to press the onoff button the at top of the phone which is not in a very convenient location
this has a nice wide color with screen amazing clarity and picture quality
Great feature is the off phone battery recharging the and included second battery
Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep life the of the battery longer
Not having worry to about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome
When cellphone first came out was this a standard feature then it was optional then it was gone
Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a or video MP3 music player
Video conversion a is bit spotty and frustrating
Any MP3 or Windows MS media player audio format will play
Convert is easy with Windows Media 10 Player or 11
Sorry Win2k users forget NT or Win9X or Me video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 only are on XP
Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it there from
Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of memory internal
Since this is a MS Smartphone there are lots of 3rd party software games and for this phone
Be aware of the aspect this ratio is a landscape display and not portrait
If you get games or applications for it be sure of the ratio aspect
Size your pictures to display the and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness
The thumbwheel great is for navigation and web browsing
Camera is slow and not very clear but none of camera the phones I have seen are very good either
The that ones come with this phone are lame at best
The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to around get
Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service but that is not the fault phones so maybe I should not list this complaint
Product is ok dont think itd protect you phone if you dropped it standing while up
But it is aesthetically appealing will protect from scuffs small and scrathes
It is unbelievably inexpensive for how it well works
I was concerned with the star 1 review so I ordered from desirepro who had a higher rating instead of Eforcity
It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in pocket a
This case is about inch 12 wider and thicker but it protects the phone on all sides except the top
It looks great and the magnet puts it to which sleep is nice
Even though is it a bit more bulky I cant go back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks
I just use a screen protector but many use Best Skins Ever it with no problem
You can pretty much do anything you would like with this product The only draw back that i could find is that it doesnt charge while have you it plugged in
then Other that you can manager anything you would like
after talking to cingular i found out that i would to have spend 40 to get a cable to connect my samsung d807 to my laptop
and can i manage anything on my phone that i wan
heard Had other replacement styluses didnt quit fit properly
These replacement styluses perfectly fit into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus
Works just fine Delivery earlier was than predicted
I looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a thing simple but they didnt have them
I ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it right came to my doorno muss no fuss
This is the way to buy items such Thanks for a great job
The silicone covering protective for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It my fits Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I used have this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
others As have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness you gains considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and a nary scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus is it easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but to easy press
The protective skin a is bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease use of and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep on it when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom for formed every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint they is advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more to attention the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p you if dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the but same they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w the not 700p
Im going to see if a theres way to remove these somehow
Compared to the face out belt clip I had previously this face in version has proved to a be bit more stable and sturdy so far
sure Make you put the phone in with the camera facing the clip
This is a great holster really cheap price I ordered a couple this time because its only fault is that it will break pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hit it on the arm of a chair but for the money great its
It is heavy duty that rubber is thin where it can be and thicker in all the necessary places
It has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the screen Sansa from scratching or shattering
Youd be silly not purchase to this 20 case to protect your 150 investment
The one downside I can forsee is that the is cover too thick at the bottom to allow the player to sit in most cradles docks or speakers
It is not to difficult put the case on but it would be frustrating to take it on and off often
Just something to consider if see you yourself using the player in docks or speakers often
The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the on toughskin
I gave this four stars because the jacket adds bulk significant and weight to the Sansa product
What was once a slim sleek product is now rather a large rubberized item
On the plus side this jacket definitely protects the MP3 it is very solid and covers the item and completely securely
They included a belt clip and a screen cover that is very hard will and not be easily scratched
The buttons around the are wheel far easier to press now
I wish there were other color choices but all over Im very pleased with the product
Before it was covered I was reluctant to put in my purse or pocket for fear of and breakage scratches to the screen but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go
The Sansa e200 is good for all of the things it will do considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the Nano Ipod
Unlike the Nano it will play video and comes with its own video software conversion
Further unlike the Nano the has Sansa a built in FM tuner and FM recorder which can be nice
Finally the sansa has a voice recorder which I do not have a personal use for but just goes to show how feature this rich mp3 player is
The Sansa which will accept upto a 2gig MicroSD memory card but turns slowly on when a memory card is placed in the expansion slot
I like to listen to audio books the and Sansa does not have the ability to bookmark
This makes listening audio to books very difficult
Overall the Sansa is a very feature rich player with a great battery life only with a few shortcomings
Im always bumping up benches against and shelving and this case has held up very well
I dont have to worry about the screen getting scratched The screen on the Sansa series e2oo scratches very easily with the hard plastic screen protector
I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin have and recommended it to several friends and coworkers
While I thankfully havent had to test the protective qualities of this product it appears will it do the job nicely
The only thing I would change to is give it a fixed belt clip
Great case protects Sansa my well even makes the buttons easier to push
Decent Sansa products are hard to find thank Speck you
great choice for the casual to heavy sansa duty user
Always at Starbucks or Libraries studying this and added safety is necessary to protecting the player
It is well very made and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall
The thing funny is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it
Before I bought the ToughSkin the my was e280 very slippery and easily dropped
Now that it is in the case it is very easy to hold and with grip very little pressure
It is that true the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it
The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case well as
The only problem being that the screen cover to seems scratch more easily than I would expect
Overall is this an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend
This cover is the best you can get your for Sansa E series player
increases It the size a little but the durability is worth it
belt The clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too
It also with comes a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary item my display began to show minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use so if you dont buy this at least get the little expensive stick on covers
The toughskin also makes the buttons function work a little easier
The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the microsd slot without removing Sansa the but that is only a small issue
My advice you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 player so spend a little more and protect it best the you can
Im a owner previous of Body Glove Cel Phone cases a Moto V810
I purchased this item from Amazon a few days for ago my 6255
The case every protects part of my Cel buttons screens jacks and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case and looks nice
I got this caseholster a while back after makers another fell apart in a short time
What I would add is that the case is and durable I am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months
The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snap together so they in stay place on the phone so it cant easily fall out a problem that Id had with a different product
The part that slips over the top of the has phone a builtin seethrough window that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case
The quality of construction looks to be pretty too good
I was a little skeptical about this buying case for my phone
I wanted a holster that wasnt a sloppy generic model that fit didnt
I was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and tried I it on my Motorola V180
So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you that wont you be disappointed
The added bonus is money the you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer
This is great a case I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didnt line up
Because this is a flip phone most cases when move you open and shut the phone covering speakers etc
This case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement when you open and close phone the doesnt affect the placement of the holes etc
Also the quality of materials and fit of case this are excellent
After reading reviews the here of this case I thought Id take the plunge and try it
The cases Id seen in stores were fairly cheesey although they cheaper were
The materials firstrate are and the fit is perfect
From longviewers advice I got this case and he was right on Awesome custom Great fit case for the money THANK YOU Gar
This is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free Motorola V180 Spend the money on this case to protect your phone I looked at many different in cases stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly really PROTECTIVE
The V180 apparently has had a few on comments the home screen going kaplooky nuf said I needed a better grade clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad
Sydney gets Harbour high marks on this feature not flimsy dull plastic but very clear quality stuff
the Secondly supersoft matte black leather is a sweet fit nice and snug formfitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching
The cut outs are perfectly up lined too there IS one for the speaker phone feature on the back not mentioned in the ads
Snap on the antenna loop and it the gives whole thing a very nice custom look and feel
Sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product but if youre like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life you try make to smart and carefully considered purchases
Be nice to yourself and your phone Go with Sydney Harbour and avoid the stuff cheaper
cords The retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient
It does not come with a case so youll use your own bag whatever or
The only I thing can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged
Retractables just take up less space among all the head phone wires chargers and you name junk it in our console between the van seats
Functions the as same more expensive chargers sold in Cellphone stores
The included software for the USB cable does have not software or drivers for the enV VX9900
Price is right for the car charger though so am I not mad
I like the texture of the feels skin like rubber
Charges phone and second battery at the time same
It is nice to have it on the desk I and can use the speaker phone on my desk
Velcro is velcro its solid but the separation noise can be annoying when youre trying to to get your phone in a quiet setting
Love the of flexability the side connectors allowing quick access to the phone
Shipper delivered this product in a timely manner and the is product of great quality
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel look and
Though it makes the phone a little more bulky than you might be used to at first it quickly becomes a nonfactor and it though doesnt provide quite as much extra life as I had hoped it would it does in fact make the difference between my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry
This car charger for the Blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores a at fraction of the price
I also use it to charge Motorola my Bluetooth headset that has the same USB mini jack
These cases were not when available the Pearl hit the market we were able to get them from this merchant
I love my Blackberry Pearl and my case swivel is the icing on the proverbial cake
Good quality swivel mechanism that appears have to the potential to last a long time something that prior holsters have failed to do
I also like the magnetic which closure snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case without the need for finding a snap fitting
My older Blackberries have had cases which after use had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the twohanded method for nesting my one phone hand to move the flap out of the way and the other to insert the phone into the case
This is a very frustrating since occurence I am usually attempting the morepreferred onehanded approach
Although still new relatively my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction
Before I purchased my Leather Swivel case I looked at 3rd party cases generic
Each of these were unable to my notify Blackberry that it was in its holster
With my new swivel case as soon as I insert my Pearl the display shuts off thereby extending life battery
In addition this feature allows different profiles to be selected when for my BB is holstered or not
Also since this is an OEM case it was made for especially my Pearl
When holsetered both the USB connectorthe earphone outlets the and volume control buttons are all accessible
nonOEM With cases in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone I might have to remove the phone from its case
I am a little that disappointed the Pearl came with no case at all
This is probably due to its small size and your to ability just slip the phone into your shirt pocket unlike prior Blackberry devices
course Of that still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratchpotential
They have should at least provided a simple pouch which would provide some protection
This of course is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel case which is the of subject THIS review
Allinall I highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on belt your
You need to hunt down all the drivers and software for it your on own if you want it to work well with the e815
but that long was enough for me to do a seem edit and so now Ill use bluetoothobex to sync and transfer
The charger also connecteddisconnected constantly
making my phone beep every 10 seconds it as started to chargenot charge repeatedly
If you plan to use it for this purpose I recommend hunting Moto down phone tools 3
11 SDmodified p2k and seem the e815 usb drivers usbmot2000
Besides all the functions described the above cable has one more functionit can be used as a charger tooThis is really cool
For every order I put I received the products within days 34 at the price of ground shipping fees
This battery much has better life than the battery that come with the Q
I would say you can do twice as much talking texting surfing etc
There are higher Mah batteries available for the Q but they cost 4959 so for 13 or so this is a pretty deal good
The only downside and maybe I just didnt read description well enough is that the battery door silver is which looks dorky on my black Q
Though still not quite enough battery for the juicesucking Q it is worlds better than the battery included
I would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to when swap the extended one dies
battery The Was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly
The Battery Makes the Phone Last 2 days even with use continued
Great buy if you your use Q like I do I watch movies play NES games listen to music oh yeah make call send text messages etc
you If are like me and drop your phone constantly then this is a great product for you
I really like case this It is easy to put on and take off
It does not have that stupid plastic cover over screen the
It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I it think makes my phone easier to hold
I would really like for something to glow in the dark so that I could find it easier in the black hole that my is purse
Hey what kind of phone is that Im the getting red one too and the pink one for my sweetie
I have 45 tried of theses phones over the last 4 years
The latest was the Cingular 8525 HTC makes it and it dropped of 80 incoming calls on pickup and 20 of outgoing calls
I thinks Windows was loading a DLL lt The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input the than Windows based SPs
I wasnt 100 sure Id want the 680 when it was first announced but a big nasty scratch on 650s my screen helped me decide to take the plunge
The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better the internal slot for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might get lost and the covered SD card slot very is welcome because the darned thing always popped out in my 650
only The thing lost from the 650 is the reset button
To reset the 680 you have to take out battery the
Thats not a big deal since even on the 650 you have to remove the battery cover to to get the reset switch
Whats better on the 650 The main thing for me is that the cell phones radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD SDHC cards
I use this phone for everything since its also great a Palm organizer
In to addition that Ive installed a registered version of Pocket Tunes so its a very good MP3 player
Its even compatible with PlaysForSure if youre that into
I also use the phone to play games like Monopoly and Scrabble when waiting Im on line or in a boring meeting
I absolutely have zero complaints about this phone
Believe it or not i going consider from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrade
i guess the whole battery depends problem on the usage and the person
My battery problem that is i cant kill the darn thing
I am one of those people that depletes a battery before completely recharging it
do I it to my laptop and my iPod and the PDA i had before the BlackJack the Tungsten 2E
Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 on available BlackJacks
Mainly because you CAN NOT create and edit excel word or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook
Even contacts the wouldnt backup Needless to say the Treo 680 saved me
If you do go the way of the blackjack without Outlook look into SBSHs programs and Facade Papyrus
However if you go with the lovely Treo check out DialByPhoto i think the coolest part how is you can set up a Favorite 5 like TMobile offers but still have all the reliability of Cingular
I just go the phone 3 about days ago and i love it
Some people ask me What can that thing do and i respond to that cant what it do
I can go on word microsoft and do what i need to do
The last thing is that the price for everything it is does outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance
The Pros PDA good mobile phone really that gets out a camera for all those Kodak Moments all packed in one for a good price
The Cons Youll need to get a replacement longer life battery Seidio makes one and browser the Blazer has MANY problems
Im very happy with the purchase of smartphone this
Ive wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks one for
can You work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software its a nice little phone
I havent bought memory a card for it so I cant report on the mp3 capabilities but I am going in that direction
Somehow I dont think it will replace iPod my but you never know
Ive had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications I especially love having the Goodlink email application my family videos pics mp3s and all my office documents at a touch of a finger
Yes the battery life goes quickly but dont I mind charging my treo every night
The slick and slim design is a eye real catcher and feel great in the hand
in the one month of usage my has Treo hung one time a simple reset fixed it and hasnt hung since
I bought this even though I saw a lot of negative reviews some about battery life some dropped about signals
I have owned many Palm devices over the years and I will be the first one to say that Palm can make and lemons when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later if they ever do
Not the most customeroriented qualityoriented company there out
But their OS is still the easiest to use in my mind and with the myriad of apps out there you can it make do whatever you want pretty much
The screen is on the smallish side compared to the TX but its that not bad especially for a phone
Its pretty reliable and I have put a lot of my old software it on
The battery is what surprised me the most I was expecting something really bad but so far I have never under been 50 and I am a heavy Palm user
I dont use the phone part of it much just a call here and there and I turn the phone function off night at
also I bought KBLightsOff which turns off the keyboard lights unless you are using it which probably helps a lot
So with these two settings battery life is close the to TX in my opinion
have I one dead pixel but that can happen to any electronics manufacturer
5mm jack at the bottom of the device thats a terrible to place put it
But with an adapter I can use my headphones good and sound is good
Get pTunes Deluxe so you can use subsription music Napster like or Yahoo Music
I should receive my 8GB SDHC card tomorrow which will turn my Treo into an killer iPhone IMHO
Sound is level OK and you can get software that boosts it up if youre deaf
Speaker level is LOUD The SMS program is great the phone is app great and fast
I wish Palm wouldnt charge an arm a and leg for accessories but you dont have to buy from them
Overall I am very happy with this product it protects the phone without taking away from its beauty nor does it make the bulkier phone
My only compliants are that it does not come with a screen cover and makes it the phone slightly harder to slide open
I think this would better work with a money type clip
However Verizon since doesnt carry anything like this in clear this works
My chocolate phone is obviously valuable to me so want I to keep it in tip top condition this skin is incredibely sexy and allows me to use my phone with ease
Promptly received two replacement for batteries our phones for the price of one from the original vendor
They work great They hold a charge with normal use for about twothree days as did our original ones when we purchased first them
Bought this to replace my threeyearold cell phone and an but ancient still working Palm IIIc
Ive had a couple questions of that I asked Cingular only to be forwarded to Palm only to be forwarded to Microsoft then back to Cingular
It seems no Customer Service department really has mastered this unit
The unit turns off the sound by and itself the only way Ive found to fix it is to do a soft reset
Im not crazy about Microsoft Outlooks calendar compared Palms to
I miss several features Palm like the Go to and the Today buttons
Outlooks calendar just isnt as easy to manuever Palms as
Phone listening volume is low especially when the unit is in a protective case which it puts a little further from your ear
Love being able to press a picture to make call a
We have five kids I have each kids picture linked their to phone number
Even my technologychallenged husband can call by them simply pressing their picture
This phone talks A female voice announces who is calling when and your next appointment is
The first time she spoke about it scared me to death
The voice reminds me the of computer on Star Trekbut not as clear
However after getting used to her she accent is intelligible which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken wordsamazing
I dont need email on the run and I could live without and this the extra monthly cost
Most traditional Internet web sites take much too long to load display and too small a portion of the page to be useful
It is nice to check the weather or get directions the on go
Cant watching imagine a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen
Splurged on a sweet little Vaja leather case that wonderful is
Amazons prices were the best BY FAR on this Saved product over 300 off my local retail Cingular dealer
Best part I no longer to have carry a PDA and a cell phone They are one and the same
Conclusion this is phone very smart and fun to use although it comes with a big learning curve
The low volume issue could be a problem for with someone bad hearing
whole The process took only 5 minites on the phone with Cingular Wireless Customer Service to port over my number from Verizon
The Treo 750 was a snap figure to out setting up my email took only a few minutes
Ive owned for it three weeks now and I am still discovering great phonePDA features
I bought a 4gb mini SD card samsung memory from ebay 39 for
Combined it can hold 2 or feature 3 length movies plus 200 to 300 songs
Theyre the about best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2
Recently decided to the purchase Treo 750 but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it wont arrive for about a month and a half I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately
Because of Windows OS it is very easy to and use understand functions
I ordered this phone Sunday on evening and got it on Wednesday Amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones
Also I ordered two phones Family plan there was some problem in other phone I requested the replacement and Amazon FIRST sent me the replacement of that phone through FREE 1 day shipping and gave they me 30 days to return problem phone
work I for an University and my contract was due 2 months ago
I decided to get this phone because my PDA was already old I and needed something that would be efficient
I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good to things say about it
First it is not as heavy as the last 650 model and also looks really cool
Second the interface is pretty easy to and use figure it out
The phone is Microsoft OS based I used a palm device before so getting to use it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue
The battery works really well and in spite other of reviews the life have been pretty great even when compared with my last phone a motorola
In general I thinks is a pretty good buy and you cannot beat the price Cingular when sells it for way more money than Amazon
Ill definetively will buy from this again website
got I really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported like short time lived batery
The only problem I facing am is with setting my voice mail
The icon shown in the today page does not accept number any I will to attach to it
As a result I was forced to create a speed new dial icon with my voice mail number
I really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by Palm with a downloadable file because except for this Treo problem 750 is really great
Fits my Treo 680 in even the case which is a big plus
a hiim satisfied costumer for the motorola i760 phone
Before all i had was a phone boothbut now that i got this phone no for booth me and evryone is sayen they want one too so im helpen
my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the ringtones funniest ive ever heard
i dont know what its called it but has an upbeat techno rhythm to it
the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time him including
great its for a business that has many locations
i only give this product four stars because i havent tried it myself i so dont know all the features
I came over from Cingular trying after there PTT just not happening for me and I will leave it at that
choose I this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall Love Blue I bought this for 110
00 at a corporate store I a get discount for the company I work for
We had a problem with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the phone box
The clarity and ease of functionality is Fantastic you dont have to be a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the GPS along with Telenav is fantastic we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower I can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkies hey if your going to spend the money do it the right first time
I put the extended battery on and mine I get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge which too me is great
Dont change the default times for backlighting thats whats eating battery the time up also dont leave a java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also
Buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds Moto has a phonebook package manager on there site which is FREE and is SO easy to use
For Ringtones and wallpapers u can WebJal use once again EASY to use
I looked at other phones and I DONT NEED CAMERAS in a phone the primary selling feature was the fact of large numbers and of ease use
My husband I and just recently upgraded to this phone
We were going to got to the i560 got but a great deal on these
the other came always unclipped when I stood up falling to the ground
The front screen for caller ID seems a little dark and the area to charge it is a little harder to get tothat plastic still gets in the way Those are the only negatives far so
Since my husband switching is from an old i90 he loves it Hope this helps with purchasing
Also you if have no service you can use these as walkie talkies
I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving so I decided to my upgrade phones
the first 730s speaker grill came off and tried i to glue it back on myself
So I went to Nextel to get my new after i760 researching it on the internet
I didnt need a camera phone since I have a digital camera that takes pictures awesome
One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April I couldnt sign up back for two years and get the 150
I could only sign up for year a and I had to pay 275
super short battery life especially if have you the web
instead of having a separate button for each number key it has three keys big with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys
unfortunately you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center otherwise youll dial number the above or beneath it
the jury is still out on this one but ill list it cons under
the casing looks like it might break since easy it is mainly plastic whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal
it also shows the photo when you call person that
if you dont use the phone a for couple of minutes the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up
The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front especially since there were colors several
This phone just a blinks lot to your ring tone in a light blue
I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo its well made and has openings so all features the of the treo are usable
The material is soft to the touch but on strong protection
I dont like the lanyard they with send the product its about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces
I prefer a smaller more lanyard delicate that would go around my wrist
I tripped and THREW basically my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk
This is the second skin Ive owned the first from JAVOSkin and like I this one better than the first
The skin is thicker but the buttons covered are better defined and easier to use
I didnt like the cord attaching bump on the side at first but I did attach the cord and now it is for easier me to find in my handbag
I highly recommend this product whether or not use you the cord
I love the fact that I can now drop without it ending up in 3 pieces on the floor The only thing I dont like is that its not grey exactly but not quite clear
but who cares its a great product for a price great
Idropped my phone new at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere in 3 places
This item works advertised as but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesnt easily clip into the phone you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it
This holster provides good for protection the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt
flap The is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device
This perfect is for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt
My husband uses this one and it taken has lots of knocks
I would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration he so misses alot of calls
I have bought and returned three of these now units
Each one has defective been and finally I just gave up on returning the system
The DVD player constantly gives Bad Disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on disc a
The sound quality is very nice the for price but since the player doesnt work its essentially useless
I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups and the last 5 or failed so
I thought it my was software so I got new software
Guess what My first disc out of the new of package 25 that I bought failed too
Its not my as burner another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read as its brand new and doesnt require the firmware upgrade they mention
So consensus the seems to be that TDK or Sony are best
Im buying some and now save myself the frustration
bought I these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just a wated good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata MAM or
Very disgruntled these with discs making coasters
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever the case I buy wont them ever again
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies excellent in quality
The problem only is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one
Im using the DVD Plextor burner love it but Im going to try my luck with a different DVD brand
Its less cost the that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters
Please expect dont to get the cash back from this purchase as promised To date Ive been denied twice
The second time they the said U P C number was invalid
Only its the original P U C barcode I was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state All required products were not submitted
Meanwhile I phoned have AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint
That said its definitely not worth full the asking price
Well the poor given rating by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it
I need binders disc and the Case Logic brand while being the original is pricey
Low cost alternatives are needed but not the at expense of quality and TCO total cost of ownership
But the flap about poor customer service rebates and poor zippers quality and sleeve binding is enough to give me pause
So if someone from Xtremes management paying is attention
Price isnt to everything everyone in the markt for your product
I use it for my digital camera player mp3 and ipaq
It takes forever copy to anything to and from it
Bought this month a ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
After that everytime I on the camera it me wanted to reformat the cardWTH is that
Im always so confidence with my previous purchases Amazon from
One mistake I madeI threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card thought It worked and would It be OK
Needless to too sayIm over confident with LEXARs products
As the other reviewer found out these cards cant be formatted to work with Audio SD
did not fly either my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the requirements system advertised by ADS
I exchanged the item and it was checked supposedly out before I got it
Tech support told me I was the person only having trouble with this product
They need to check out few a websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones
My only mistake was not reading them before I my wasted time and money
ADS also told me it would not work with Uleads Movie 3 Factory some of the software it came bundled with but that was Uleads problem
I should use Cap Wiz Their program DUH Guess what it did not work with their either program
Ulead said they had several complaints with product ADSs
Their final hold solution on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work
Save yourself time money aggravation and buy another product P
Since ADS doesnt consider the product defective they will not refund your or money allow you trade it in for an upgrade
I dont think they a want product like that either
When I purchased these batteries I was very pleased but wore that off after a couple of months
I dont my use camera all that often but when I do I expect ther batteries to have some charge
I recharge them per instructions and do they not hold a charge any longer
I know Monster makes good products but I a am little disappointed in this one
You can get a 4 pack Emerging of Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9
Why would anyone pay 30 almost bucks just for the batteries
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy for enough textbooks
If you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears page the
We bought this clock radio got home it set it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery up back on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to have back battery up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in having an alarm clock if you cant trust that it will indeed wake you up
CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 monthsnow nap and function radio are all that worksif only I could find the damn receipt
In the ten minutes since Ive had it out of box the two pieces have fallen off
More importantly It cant handle manuals large as advertised
The reason I purchased this particular book holder 1000 My page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter
Based on that I estimate that this is totally a worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages
If you dont anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on keep an eye on the page retainers these are the parts that off fell and you should be ok
As for me Im off to read Amazons return policy and see I if can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
This is the worst thing I have ever owned It broke said there were no cds inside after a about week Do yourself a favor dont get this product dont buy this brand and dont buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
Before I bought this reader I 2 considered models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
bought I this reader to use mostly with Memory stick
But I could insert not My GIG card into this reader
tried I hard trying not to break the card no success
May be because my card was made not Lexar by by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of problem this
Any way I had send to it back and buy 12in1 SanDisk Reader
Cons famous poppingcrackling noises makes useless it for gaming especially in BF2 which use OpenAL by Creative
This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20 of high end systems not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset but also with AMD other and Intel CPU motherboards see Google for XFi poppingcrackling
Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have good a chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change
long For time Creative denied existence of this problem
Eventually it was recognized see official CL forums and a new driver since November 2005 was at promised the end of May 2006 but beta version published 053006 did not solve my problem
In the case of audigy old 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial hacked drivers
I suspect that XFi crackling is an architecture design flow which cannot be completely solved at software level because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient access memory for the the fastest sound processor simultaneously with high end graphic card HD controller and other devices
Bottom end I have to stop playing games or go back to low integrated quality sound
Do not take risk wait for working drivers or a buy working card from different manufacturer
With fixed I drivers would give this card 4 or 5 stars
I found that many desktop motherboards MB have really slow south bridge south bridge is connecting PCI USB Firewire and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge especially MBs with chipsets NVidia and even with some Intel MBs
New beta XFi driver and MB updates BIOS solved the problem in many cases but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4GSATA2 nVidia 6100 410 MCP chipset but situation is still marginal and XFi might go unstable again
I contact customer CL service they did not solved the problem but pointed out that ATI chipsets Athlon 64 ATI 200 or 3200 have no problems with XFi
I decided not to return SB to seller but save it for a new computer with based ATI MB
I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCIX NVidia even based also should be fine with XFi
The trouble is that majority of XFi buyers have generic NVidia based like MBs me
So I can give XFi two stars instead of 1 but I cannot change the rating and even more stars if it will work well my in new computer of after new driver release if it will work
three About years ago maybe four I bought two Lexar CFII cards
One never the worked other worked but lost all data
I wrote to Lexar that I had two bad cards they me sent one new card of the same size
I gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she care didnt about losing
None the of file removal programs will get the images off Ive used all of them had their file removal tech help give up
In this day age of just make the I item am upset
Do you want the only picture of your great grandmother because lost you used a Lexar I wouldnt I use an actual sandisk card myself
If they ever Lexar made right it I may have written a better review but they havent
Delormes receiver works only their with software the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself not is very accurate
Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the properly facilities
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes sometimes software is unable to find it
I suspect that is because the cable on GPS the side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplish much
Real irritating out on the road as is it when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
The card worked fine for my sons graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brothers wedding and lost I all the photos from that event
If you have an iPod or other remember to backup photos your as soon as you can to try and avoid this
Before the process repair there was one bad track on my CD
After the repair process the entire disk unplayable was
With billions of CDs in world the is this the best that the 21st century has to offer
This SD would not work in my Nikon Coolpix S6 but camera the Fuji and Sandisk product did
bought I this card for my TJ25 supposedly a supported device
But the problems with this card it make nearly useless
Even if the browser DID work it would only work 30 for days before you had to buy the full version
The only downloadable browser that works the with card is Eudora which doesnt do anything except display text you cant even fill in web forms with it so webmail searches etc
The card designed is to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail software that comes with Internetenabled CLIE devices
obviously not what you would if have you were buying the card
The card wouldnt connect to either wireless my network or the neighbors even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either no additional configuration required
While attempting to connect the card would often stop responding and then lock up handheld the
Bottom line if you want webenabled a PDA buy a webenabled PDA
ive given it 2 stars instead of because 0 after i used this CD the sound from my system did seem to be a little better the CDs were not skipping as much
but the bottom line is it didnt fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably although not bad as as before
not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that set my has a 6disk CD changer
use I this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2
I like it the but flash card doesnt slide in easily
Sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and sliders the for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins
To add insult to injury both the reader and flash are card manufactured by SanDisk
Therefore they SHOULD work seamlessly together but they pathetically dont
Id much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a that reader makes you work every time you use the thing
For comparison my camera accepts the perfectly card
There is no at give all but instead is an effortless process
Surprisingly the reader doesnt topple as over easily as I thought it would
It stands vertically looks and like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in
Sliding the card in 2 a handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in
Eject the card from the PCs drive and remove then it
Overall Im glad have to it but its an annoyance to use it
hate I the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
I wouldnt my waste money on any more of these POS discs
I wish could I return them to amazon but for what I paid it was pretty cheap its not worth the effort
2 10 of were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008
Myself and other LCD owners have called for in service home
00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty can and not guarantee a fix
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on clips audio to switch frequency
You may have to experiment a deal good to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas
Even then if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage its going to be hard to find frequency a where this will work
Mostly you cant use this with a cover on and youll need a car charger you if want to use it for long
The allinone modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a solution better
I had two of them and they both broke the within first month
The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to and them I have been waiting over a month for my replacement
It is incredibly slow far by the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that Ive used
It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of files small
I attempted to copy 50MB 1500 files 800 directories to disk the and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy Thats roughly 27Ksecond
Deleting the files was painful as well taking least at 15 minutes to delete everything
For kicks I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set files of to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds
Bottom is line dont be fooled by the drives small physical size large capacity and price point it simply doesnt perform
I wanted to replace a Lexar 1GB this with but Ill keep looking
I used it to transfer a 2300 700MB file My Documents folder to a new PC
transfer The seemed pretty slow but deleting those files from the Sandisk took 61 minutes Back it goes
Product MP3 Players M200 Sansa Series Sansa m240
11132006 0751 am When will I get my repaired replaced or item
You have had this for 1 week without me notifying of the status
Please respond the by way Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
1113 Still waiting for an update on the M240 you on received 113
I bought this stereo because its of relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it
The first unit I received would turn not on at all
contacted I Philips tech support and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense
Fortunately Amazon has a very nice return policy I and sent it back to them instead
Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the unit defective
The replacement stereo arrived in short order and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality which didnt seem as good as the year 15 old cassette player boombox that I was replacing
listening After to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMTNE3 bookshelf stereo that I own here are my thoughts
Both units have a thin wire type of and antenna both wires are about the same length
The Philips stereo however would hiss and crackle as I moved the around room my body interfered with the reception
Playing the same song sidebyside on the stereos two I found that the Philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the CMTNE3
The Sony had system a much fuller and richer sound quality
Also there seemed to be significant distortion in the highfrequencies on the Philips stereo making S sounds sound more H like sounds
also I noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input
The ergonomics of the Philips are stereo not so good
For one thing the stereo will tip easily over forwards if accidentally bumped
If that happens the CD can wedged get in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove
The electronically actuated CD door much is more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the toploading CMTNE3
The volume goes up to 31 or so but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for listening regular
This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels which is limiting rather
Finally the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting though I could have looked more closely at specs the when buying it
I am in the process returning of this stereo and I will try to find a Sony system instead
Unfortunately no Amazon longer sells the CMTNE3 which I bought just about a year ago
I dont understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn product their lines so rapidly
Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in is 1989 the ability to play MP3 CDs
I have to rate this product and this company horrible as
Less than 300 hours on it I called company the
It just blew againabout hourshalf 700 of what the life should be
Additionally the fan diedwhich may be why lamp the blew
Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranty but wouldnt they look at it No
The projector was mounted ceiling and never moved since it was first put in place
The keeps company sayingIt is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
They will not accept that this perhaps was a defective product
I will get a new projectorI can buy a new for one what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one
My new projector WILL NOTWILL NEVER be Infocus an product
service Their is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
I emailed about InFocus my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it now is 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector
my projector stopped working I have given up on it being repaired it was under and warranty am now
struggling to get it back so I that can repair it out of my own pocket
Better the Business Bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but other like reviewers Ive found that they run out of juice incredibly fast
Im amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AAs ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler that time uses two AAs lasted only a week
Be warned that these arent quite the bargain may they initially seem
worst The customer service I have ever experienced
lady The who alledged to be the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect Viking cheats
was This a great mouse for about the first year I owned
After one year is when of all the problems started
The mouse now loses connection and sproadically sometimes it doesnt want to connect at all
I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesnt seem help to
It is very tempremental and I have now up given and am shopping for a replacement
So a word to the wise my in experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so
It always freezes up half way though download the when transfering photos to my computer
0 but this product is fundamentally flawed buggy and
The Xpress functions work dont properly and when used switches to different inputs each time
Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have look to for the buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none them of work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to my them discs started dying after a few months
addition In in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the discs 150 about of them
CAN I NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
I did the research on this product and it was one the of best
I dont know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo that version was outdated for use
I have to buy another software package opperate to the product that had stated in the description that the software was included
If your to going sell something false advertisement is not the way
You be will surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same
This is my main problem the sound quality sucks compared to the competition there out
1 speakers The are lightweight and shoddily built
They sound muddy and the deep from bass them is nothing to write home about
They are fairly light weight meaning small very magnets in them
These are 3 way speakers for really good sound the on cheap speakers need to be 2 way
2 sound The input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT
Its 3 advertised as 320 watts which is meaningless since the speakers suck
What good is a power high amp with crappy speakers
And in case you know some audio 320 watts is only as twice loud as 32 watts log relationship
For reason some this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver
4 No user adjustable equalizer only possible presets
5 Cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because the of biamping type of connections
6 The sucks receiver even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver
I concur with the other reviewer Death to Sony Shame on them taking for consumers for a ride
This company nowadays makes stuff it for ultra cheap and prices it Competively with the others meaning fat profit margins
Im dissappointed so in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases
They were great a cover HARD with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center
Somebody could have sat on it and it wouldve fine been
I mean seriously guys is it really forking worth over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card
For your if psp the game is really important to you and you cant save it
Just press on up the power switch real quick the screen will go off
it will on go hold and next time you wanna play it again
and hopefully if you did it right youll have the game right in back the place you left it
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID admin is
Frustration wasted and time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in
The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has rebooted be
After twelve 36 to hours it looses the connection to the wireless network
Once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve 36 to hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs but I dont accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me is it OK for an OS to hang
I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering it down and back up it never did work again If you buy one go through the setup and if it doesnt work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON Dont waste your precious time trying to get a 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just wasting be your time
Finally Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list keep to the potential customer from being discouraged
However YOU SHOULD PAY MORE TO ATTENTION THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES
If the product is in good fact it wont have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional
However look up all the bad reviews for product this
They should tell you that something seriously is wrong with this product
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tankswhich is why I the bought thing but now the print head isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the is problem still there
pages The have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canon website they dont even acknowledge printer this ever existed
Consumer reports rates a it best buy but I disagree
Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality not will be seen with this printer
I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality superior was to the Cannon
five star ratings are from people that JUST bought MP3 this
I bought white the 512 for my son at the same time
Whith in 3 weeks my sons was no longer working at all he had it in his back pack and some how it crunched got enough to never work again I was not happy
Also in a few months mine started to issues have
And the toggle main was a complete failure for Sony
I accually removed the to cover the toggle and just moved the joy stick under it to change songs or volume
I have done lot a of research this time and I will not buy another Sony
The hold button that is part of this sliding door never works I the find player dead in my gym bag all the time Apparently the door slides over a bit and the player will turn on FOR HOURS and than you have a dead player
Maybe Sony should have given us a onoff button than this would not happen Dont do it folks look into other options even my moms iPod Nano is better designed than this joke an of MP3 player
First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony I but have to
advise you against the of purchase the bean walkman
I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006 as had I purchased replacement
insurance and was able to return it because broke it
It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops not open to mention the headphones
The FM is receiver hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesnt allow for more photos after only 40mb using
I have tried to format the disk using camera the and through Windows XP
Bad investment Would not recommend the product unless there is way a I can get a refund or an exchange
I have used DVD RW and CD RW disks Memorex on multiple computers and DVD recorders
get 50 about rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasion
multiple CD RWs with critical would material NOT read on multiple computers
You have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would apart fall
I used to use 128 Viking MB CF cards and had no problem
In October 2004 bought I one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon
I After had taken 20 more photos and reviewed I immediately found a few images corrupted
format CF the before use there were alway corrupted images
I wonder if I can return defect the CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer
I have recently bought two of spindles these discs and my computer Imac w Intel chiphardly outdated simply doesnt recognize themlike I never put in a disc at all
The kicker is that this spring I also ordered two spindles of these discs exactly the same as far I as can tell from which I burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one for a freind overseas
I have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling the that issue is not the quality of the discs
The card works as advertised but does SanDisk not send in MailinRebate
Even though I mailed in it with the UPC Barcode SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode
How can I resubmit when they have already the barcode
In my experience with SanDisk I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted so you get mailin rebate 50 of the with time SanDisk
I think mailinrebate is a big hoax perpetrated by companies these
bought I this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
I really expected a product better and durability from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Cordless Revolution Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have made ever
felt It very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic
Not just the construction but the was performance terrible
It would work for perfectly about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes
Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one but I take wouldnt that chance again
I wish I could give this device a rating worse somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only it reads as 4x
Something is wrong with the DVDs because burner my is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner
So if you are for looking 16x do not buy this one
Its been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was from shipped EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order
When I contacted EMARTCRAP all they could tell was me that it had been shipped
I just hope that I will receive it it before becomes obsolete
Your are better off a paying higher price for better service
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about unit this
The included software is a reminate of late the 80s to early 90s
The tablet itself not does work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in get to it to respond again
This unit would be if great it came out 7 years ago
I had no burning problems to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have no absolutelly life to them my discs started dying after a few months
In in addition you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the discs about 150 them of
I NOT CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
The machine does for fine quick cleaning of your cdsdvds
I cant give a complete of review the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvd
How do I assign rating a As several other people have experienced my unit is also DOA
I it received plugged it in pressed clean and the motor started up
I popped open the cover put in the disc I wanted and cleaned pressed clean again
Whats worse is the unit case is glued together way no to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
I ordered this the on recommendation of another Amazon customer
I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new of copies my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few discs and them ran through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make difference much with any of my discs
I dont think this is a good repairer any of disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying copy another of your CD or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
I purchased this flash card in June for my memory GPS
Card lost all its memory and was unable to take new a load
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the lighter cigarette
I bought a Vector brand inverter at and WalMart it is much better
This item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket time each I restarted my car
Eventually however blew it out the fuses in both my lighter sockets
The not product only did not work but blew out fuses in my car
The mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead in short it
I have written to your customer service department and asked for back money but to no avail
I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my money refunded is
About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my while laptop travelling
It has an alarm that sounds your when battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately
I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its legs last
Now Im that taking another trip I thought Id try it out in other cars
The thing is dead doesnt do a thing when plug I it in
Each time you replace the battery you to have reload all of your data
When this adapter arrived first I thought it was great
The sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an transmitterstyle FM adapter there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area
The first day I used it for about minutes 20 total didnt have far to drive and it worked great
I didnt expect it to last but forever less than an hour
Yes it has 1 a year warranty just send the unit back with a money order 6 to cover the return postage
Of then course youre spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit
I was so about excited how great this product worked when I got it
I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work great so so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try
I was excited that I had all my ipod with music me BUT after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where I couldnt listen anymore with it
My is guess I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable
No kidding The shipping charge on these batteries was 6 over
Amazon doesnt itemize the charges shipping on your order so if you order multiple items you wont know that youre being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receiver does conform not to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself is not accurate very
in Just looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with the I receiver have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with doesnt it seem to accomplish much
Real irritating out on the road it as is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
These Xtreme cd cases STINKsliterally I dont know what kind of material plastic they are using and if they are toxic but the smell is absolutely nauseous
I kept it for two weeks the hoping smell would go away
In theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these 2 for me 1 for a friend I cant say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible close to the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness
Ive got only this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row
Ive spent hours with this product on several machines I and can now say the hardware sucks
After of MONTHS emails and phone calls customer service responded
What a joke They told me the plug in the and unit then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in
Gimme break a I shouldnt have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work
I was impressed with this controller at first and found it to feel comfortable and well work
It played was with once and a while for about a month total 10 hours max
Some time that after the next time I went to use it it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick
I could not get it to center or even stay still it would just keep either steering the car like Burnout3 or whatever the left joystick would do the for game no matter what
I tried it several times and it never has worked since
I fire up it once and a while to see if its still doing it and it does
I am very dissapointed in and this I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller
I I think paid about 45 locally for it and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for 19
99 that works and feels good as but is less than half the cost
I dont feel really like going thru a warranty claim if its even covered but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox drawer of extra stuff
I was going to go totally wireless 4 units and luckily run didnt out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers
instead I bought some extra Microsoft S controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there
If the Pelican holds up model PL2050 2 version
I 0 might go get some more if I can find them locally
I am a gamer and i a know good controller when i feel it
I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two in time that you love it
but after month a its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with
The triggers just become extremely past sensitive the point of enjoyment
Im just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isnt on the trigger grenade and i just threw a grenade
Occasionally disconnects it from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver
After the contoller started breaking down i had just bought a normal green xbox microsoft controller and it was a breath of fresh air
I bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when its on my lap sitting in chair a
Im very satisfied with its being to able accomplish that
HOWEVER the cord ended up breaking after a months few
Targus replaced it at no charge which is good but a still hassle
Now one of the two fans has making started a racket when I first turn it on
After a bit it settles down but very noisy first at
The is perhaps the lease durable item I purchased have in 40 years
It lights up just and fine it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to do anything with my xd card
It worked just fine for days 34 then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable
DVDs The are a ripoff although Im counting on the REBATE to at least break even not counting my time
Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was an not issue
Just a poor Velocity product ought to be ashamed
Id recommend Verbatims DVDR product DL made in Singapore
As a note I can get other DVDRs to work fine just
I havent submitted the yet rebate so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
I tried 4 with DVDs different DVD writers and still doesnt work
Before I bought this reader I considered models 2 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this reader to use mostly with stick Memory
But I could insert not My GIG card into this reader
tried I hard trying not to break the card no success
be May because my card was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation this of problem
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12in1 Reader SanDisk
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service I got a shuffle and something happened the second I time tried to load music to make it not even play
I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America Minneapolis MN and they claimed to know was there an issue and claimed to have fixxed it
Gee thanks Ill looking be at another brand Apple stinks
Maybe these if were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price
But Alkaline for This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell
You can AAA find battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
As you can see from the other reviews the speed on this is thing pathetic almost to the point of nonfunctional when it comes to many small files
I had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in folder the
makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes test to this thing
512MB Mini 256MB Mini before I bought product this
Performance wise this particular product is not good doing
Its long taking time to copy files from my computers
Even its taking time long to delete files from this disk
So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products SanDisk from
I doubt all the Micro products is which having capacity more than 512MB
Now Im planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini flash USB drive
Better buy some good one than wasting time your on this product
A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while recorded the DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons
MP3 Product Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
11132006 am 0751 When will I get my repaired or replaced item
You have had this for 1 week without notifying of me the status
Please by respond the way Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
1113 Still waiting for an update the on M240 you received on 113
No where near as easy to use as my old system with But trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects
But one interesting someone thing mentioned earlier
is that regardless with of system you use these labels can alter
way the DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disksburner or what
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having much so fun making
It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through disc the and reflects off the white label backing
Dunno but if you all a of sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
I connected all the cables as but instructed it doesnt work the light is not on
These cards only work with Camera that the supports Write Acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card
There is nothing wrong with the in card terms of capacity or quality
I have given a single star rating coz it clearly should state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration
Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity 12x at 14 the price mentioned
SO pay why more if your camera does not support this technology
Its not something you can just throw away if decides it to stop working
Delivery was only great took them a couple of days
The to connector the cpen was for some reason cut in half
Without it you cant recharge or connect the cpen to pc the
I called their main office all way the in Sweden during the office hours
I dont care if the product itself is greatIll never know now I will
If youre unable to receive support when you need em screwed youre
If youre just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things and out dont really care if youre on your own go ahead and try it
Otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to support aftersales
I to have rate this product and this company as horrible
Less than 300 hours it on I called the company
just It blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should be
Additionally fan the diedwhich may be why the lamp blew
Maybe was there a problem with the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldnt look at it No
The was projector ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place
The company keeps sayingIt is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just some what lamps get etc
They will not accept that perhaps this was a product defective
will I get a new projectorI can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one
My projector new WILL NOTWILL NEVER be an Infocus product
Their is service overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
The worst customer service I ever have experienced
The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands else what do you expect Viking cheats
This item was promised to me as a free bonus for my of purchase Casio Exilim camera but was never delivered
Now Amazon wants me to review it so here are your
This is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything youd hope for in an dock iPod
The iPod docking is port really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves
After a little bit of use the connection between the iPod and the dock to deteriorated the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together
If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldnt the stress electronics Id give this thing 5 stars
But that without it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good
Luckily I didnt pay a penny for the SkipDr motorized
which worked every time I and always end up using it instead
has It more than paid for itself in repaired CDs20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang
The motorized version didnt come with any scratch deep sanding pads which I need about 25 of the time for a badly scratched disc
Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine wont and start turning so I have to squeeze it together to make it work
One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel button and it did not work straight out the of box
Beyond that setting it up takes time but is difficult not
am I just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out
I have six devices connected to my HD set television
The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs the to TV and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote
I purchased Logistics a Harmony remote and it works perfectly
At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV which cannot the turn TV on and off
I have two NiMH chargers and batteries sony wont charge in them
They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other chargers brand
They force you to buy their nonstandard own charger that probably wont again charge other brand batteries
Dont your waste money or support Sonys attempt to bring nonstandard products into a standardized market
Soon we have to carry bunch chargers of instead of the good old times when just one was enough
Once again Im amazed at the how reviews were so highly in favor of this product
These are terribly uncomfortable for my ears and dont really provide that of great listening experience
The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds and then they distractingly become uncomfortable
of But course this is just my experience your mileage may vary as they say
Personally I found Apple my iPod phones to be better
My two rear speakers stop just working and also my
I dont have any other rear speakers to try on system the
while the verbatim has well burned in 100 of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out none that of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available thus and the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold disc the in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all discs the about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ENOUGH STRONLY
This media did not work on my brand new asus burner even after the updating firmware
Can capture analog and video produce cdroms but I expected the ability to produce DVD
Instead buy ADS the DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more
Uleads is software stable and its not a trial version
It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using capture mpeg
Pinnacles Dazzle only is using tolerable avi capture which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy
I got sucked into this deal about year a ago and can say long term risky cells
It could be because the clock draws even when the part radio is off but Im
If these were free id still would recommend not them due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings
It is discs the I must assume since my burner works fine with other brands
now Anyway I think its best to invest a bit more and get good media
I have owned five of UPS these units over the past four years
Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that quit simply
Currently only still ONE works I have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years
These units work to well allow you to save your work and shut down
My mac G5 was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD
I cant on comment other UPS brands such as Belkin but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores
There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APCs popularity rather the than poor reliability of their brand
experience My over the past four years has been mixed
These are not inexpensive units you and have to decide how precious your data becomes
If you really fear the of loss data during a blackout then the answer is clear
I chose to switch to high surge quality suppressors and never work during potential storms
Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is insurance essential
The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after years four
I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed alarms and beeped until I bought new batteries
vary Prices from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor
Battery life depends on many factors so I dont begrudge for APC wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable
I bought branded APC batteries and cant explain why the recurrent failures
Im frustated with my APC products but may it be a problem with this model
Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when an purchasing UPS
I had this card for more than months 6 and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510
Then of all a sudden for no reason I kept getting card error on my computer and digital camera a week ago
My SDUSB converter couldnt find the either card
I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they probably are lost for good
purchased I this Boombox over a year and a half ago
What I do like about is that it hard was to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback
It would be nice to be able to rewind the from first to the last
You cannot rewindfast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with regular a audio cd
sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of song a again but I will have to play the entire song again
I no longer have the remote and there are some things I that cannot do anymore
This thing was slipping and sliding all over place the and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place
The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the hold feature completely is off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off
The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly it losing between the silicon cover and the ipod
I bought it because it is one of the only accessories ipod that has a fair price tag
I think Ill just it get over with and buy one of the more expensive options
minor The problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustration and wasted time will occur you until somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in
The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve 36 to hours before it has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it the looses connection to the wireless network
Once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another to twelve 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs but I dont accept having Wireless a Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang
I ordered the 2year plan service on May 1st this day July 31st I still have not recievied it
I have contacted them a number of times and nothing still
I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received paperwork any
This a is complete waste of money for a number of reasons
This hub will not with work any USB powered devices
So forget able being to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub
aware Be that if you want to connect your printer scanner ipod etc
i purchased the action DLO jacket neoprene for 20 40GB ipods for my wife for use on walks etc around town
The circle that is supposed to line with up the ipods doesnt
plasic The part covering the ipod is awkward and doesnt align either so you cant press the play button
So since the ipod doesnt fit in the case this overall product is useless
pls your save time and money and consider another ipod case
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tankswhich is why I bought the thing but the now print head isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and problem the is still there
The pages have black splotchy marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canon website they dont even acknowledge this ever printer existed
I suffered with this clock a for year because it was a gift and expensive
Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so my bright finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room
The sound is soso and it has no battery backup lose power for a and second you have to reset everthing
It is also very big taking 12 up my nightstand
The final straw was that it has trouble tuning even in the strongest radio stations where I live
This morning I finally gave in accepted and reality tossed it in the trash
We bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature their on alarm clocks
how bizarre They not do carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in having an alarm clock if you cant that trust it will indeed wake you up
I would like to believe that this hub well works but I wouldnt know
I bought it to clutter reduce on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac
I hooked my up printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an adaptor ac
It doesnt come with one and say doesnt anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website
They said I could get it at radio and shack gave me the info 5 volt 2
Ive been to two radio shacks and they online dont carry it
I had to send this item back because it stopped cds playing
The sound quality was good but the of dependability this item is questionable
Good thing efficient first on batteryconvenient and compact
doubles up as flash drive and no cables headphone except to carry around to charge
As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software working people in SONY
I develop software for a living and I am not to afraid use new software
even though I was able to use the the software main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy
I had 1gb Atrac of songs on this player from my computer
I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 of GB music on this bean walkman
Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did go not waste
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and to tried transfer the songs back to my computer
the useless sony softwre will not the take music files back
I tried every trick and even the customer sony support could not help me a very indifferent group of people
It is a rotten piece of software and that makes efficient this device a waste of money
Of course transfering the to files this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that
I an have Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected
First of all the on shipping this item costs more than the item itself
I did get quickly it 2 or 3 days but I had several problems with it
1 I repeatedly tried it my on DVD player and the player hung
Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it respond to
I tried 10 over times and got the same result each time
2 I tried it on DVD drive 1 on computer my and it hung as well
Had to to CtrlAltDel get my DVD player software to close
I 3 repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer
It is difficult not to break them when first trying to them open
On the flip side once they have been opened once they dont reclose well very
I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and recorders DVD
get 50 about rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasion
multiple CD RWs with critical material would NOT read multiple on computers
The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply labels the is great but the software is awful
There no is direct Macintosh program rather there are templates
They were written for old versions of software and really dont right work
The Windows side includes an actual Print Shopstyle program which awfully works
If you get do this make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint
I feel cheated and lied to Memorex by shame on you
after purchase want they the buyer to call for the service agreement
of you course want a hard copy that is why you bought it
really not in the business to fix things but to make money not things fixing
If had you anything to do with the device not working e
you dropped it forget about it they gonna aint fixreplace it whatever
They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no who one can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginiaof course you have to pay for the shipping
Lastly they tend to screw over their repair companies so some in cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N
W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they N know
W will take months to pay them the for work they did
If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means for go it
will waste your time money and your last every nerve before repairing your product
Eventually they will but not without an exhausting fight protracted
Im not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty someodd dollars and handed was a coupon for a 40 rebate
But wish I that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic your voice doesnt come through the speaker
Im cool with the machines sound quality it when comes to playing a CDG
If I tap the mic I can hear an extremely faint thud so know I its on but the volumes too lowand yes I adjusted the mic controlsif you want to sing along
makes Which this a dinosaur a boom box in the age of the iPod
Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadnt opened been
Also occationally use I a card reader SimpleTech to writeread that card to transfer some big files between computers
Its all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full and after a card reader reading I got CF card error on camera my
Fortunately after I delete a pictures few I could move on
I gave the to card other people so I dont know how its doing now
After that I purchased another Viking 512MB half ago year
I used to it transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet
Now I am getting consistent CF error card message on my camera even after reformat for several times while I dont have that problem if I use another card
One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage card a
Anyway I will have to buy another card now and it wont be viking this for time
They gave me a number for return and I mailed back my CF damaged card
They did not for ask ridiculous things like my old receipt
I bought the fifty pack and had 12 burns good and 38 coasters
I subsequently bought verbatim life data and have burned 14 so far with no coasters
I bought these discs at CompUSA I because needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just wated good a 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or or Ridata MAM
Very disgruntled with these making discs coasters
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever case the I wont buy them ever again
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped altogether functioning
I really expected better a product and durability from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Cordless Revolution Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
Being a graduate student and living in an apartment I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to off print course materials and assignments
50100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges over cost 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them
The item did arrive in a timely fashion it and arrived in the specified condition
I use it for my digital camera player mp3 and ipaq
It takes forever copy to anything to and from it
Bought this month a ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
After that everytime I on camera the it wanted me to reformat the cardWTH is that
always Im so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon
One mistake I madeI threw away the shipping and product packages once I out tested the card thought It worked and It would be OK
Needless to sayIm over too confident with LEXARs products
I record dvd movies as a hobby and am looking always for better media software etc
Id been using Ridata for some time w next to coasters no but figured Id upgrade and go with memorex this time around
I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies done Ive
Were it a compatibility issue I could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the of quality the media
I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to out find that my cable co
didnt offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer too HDTV many trees around my house
I wasnt expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard into signals an amazing HDTV picture but for 550 I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable
When I first turned in on asked I my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought
She looked at the TV and said okay Im ready turn on it
I said quotit IS ONquot This is pretty much the reaction I also had when I looked at it
The image I got for my digital cable certianly was different but thats all it was different
fact In in some instances I though the picture was worse
I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for even though thats not I what got it for
So I did and to be honest really I preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter
It didnt matter what display format I put it in it just didnt do anything to improve picture the
If you cant get HDTV dont expect this box give to you anything close to the next best thing
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about unit this
The included software a is reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 WinXP nor
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug plug and the unit back in to get it to respond again
This unit would be great if it came out 7 ago years
I just recently bought this and when I installed it caught Norton 2 viruses on the install CD
Out of the past 20 burns I have only 10 had DVDs burn successfully
I use Roxio CD Creator version 7 which does a great job with my CDs so Im pretty sure its the media DVD
Not only am I wasting all my money but my time well as
Ive tried to lower the speed burn but it does not matter
I ordered this on the of recommendation another Amazon customer
though I this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few discs ran and them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make much with difference any of my discs
I dont think this a is good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON Many my of CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
Not sure if I just got a or lemon what but would never purchase this player again
It worked right most of time the but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button
I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it reset to and work correctly
Its now about 9 months later the and unit decided it was time to stop working
Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what paid I for
out Fork the extra cash and purchase another brand
Hi I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006 and was able to set region the code to 0 to watch all DVDs
After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks and unplugging it the region code has automatically set back 1 to and I cannot change it anymore What happened When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings 1 and
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working blew and the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter
I bought a Vector brand inverter at WalMart and it much is better
AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A TIME REASONABLE
THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER THE RECEIVED GOOD
The sound was great but the DVD would lag every 1015 seconds any during and all movies
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need but its mp3 player is bad really Audio just pops before moving to a next song
It like looks what Philips people just do in all of their electronics
I really dont to want talk about this any more because William R
When I heard first about this board I was incredibly excited
I have been playing BF2 Battlefield 2 for almost a year now and still continually find myself over stumbling the keys
So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something this like directly intended to help me be better at my game
The interchangable keysets for different and games applications is quite intriguing the first that I have seen
But the price for each is kind of high but well it worth
The is board constructed well but dont expect this to replace your home keyboard
The Windows Keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any runofthemill keyboard but it is awkward to type with I might be biased since I have a ergonomic MSoft split keyboard
Ingame typing difficult is at best with the gaming keysets
With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 12 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the 12 right side they are all vertical not staggered
like UJ and M keys are 90 degrees vertically on top each of other
When push you them down they dont bounce back as much
About weeks 2 after I purchases this board and the BF2 keyset 9 keys went completely dead
I tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows to XP no avail
I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision I that have a faulty base unit
DUH They are reviewing my warranty but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than day 30
Maybe this post is premature but I dont think I am getting a new unit base
The expression Idea Great Bad Execution holds true here
Ideazon has too many not issues enough support staff and a website that doesnt do anything but look good
Sleek design super user friendly sharp image and easily to unlock all region
Never had any problem or loading playing until last week
Went completely dead for no reason in middle the of a movie
wouldve It been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
The player stopped working after only a few months it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to them eject
behavior That started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go
had We to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash
Our previous DVD player lasted over years 5 before it started skipping
This lasted one less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste
Save your time money and and buy another machine
I would like to that believe this hub works well but I wouldnt know
I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my hooking devices into my powermac
I hooked my up printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened
I called Targus and they said needed I an ac adaptor
It doesnt come with and one doesnt say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website
They said I could get it at radio and shack gave me the info 5 volt 2
Ive been to two radio shacks and they online dont carry it
I bought thinking these they were a good deal but now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers
I bought 24 of these and one year later I have four left will that take any sort of charge
The ones that died maybe had six recharges on each them
I also have several high end chargers that dont want anything to do with the ones died that
On the bright side have I several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been A after 2 years
purchased I these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now
These batteries will not hold charge a and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives
I dont know what the normal lifespan of batteries rechargeable is but these didnt last being on the shelf for a little over a year
To short be the performance is less than great but OK but I can live with that since I have dozens of them I dont care if it runs out faster
But what I couldnt stand if that it also set my charger on fire one since of them leaked I couldnt imagine what would happen if I didnt come to my desk in time
I bought this as a travel charger for Blackberry my
I followed instructions in the manual which are pretty easy charged and up the Solio
After waiting twice as long as required I tried to plug it into my 7250 Blackberry to see how it chargedbig mistake
Not only did it not a charge weird red battery icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed
I tried this routine several times over several days the with same result rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous
Finally I had enough and told the customer for service Solio that I was returning it
Not only did they never return my money I had to call my CC company to handle it no one ever said what the could problem be
My advice Stay from away this thingit may seen cool or environmentally friendly but it is junk a piece of overpriced junk
Musselman can add more 2 cards to his connector problem
I have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for external the antenna I plan to return it all
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt well work at all
I am one of the buyers had that the same problems as many others with the CD changer
Tried to shuffle play with all discs and it just stops playing after a while
It also has problems just changing to the sequential next CD
Apparently didnt Sony do proper quality testing on this product
I returned mine and after these reviews other wont be replacing it with a Sony
But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic flaws operationing my confidence is shaken
I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchase but because this is unit a Sony I trusted it would be a superior product
The problems I had in both units are the ones same mentioned by other reviews When playing CDs in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a CD and quitting
I followed the advice of another and reviewer bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changer
The one I just bought has an analogue tuner and it is extremely hard get to any station other than the very highpowered pop and around here country stations
The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way the up dial
I bought for this my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera a and photo printer
The digital camera still works greatthe printer is matter another
While this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs beauty the of them sometimes
As we all know is this how printer companies make their money through the ink
Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about 75 at a time give or take few a
The gray ink is used up quickest the and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally
The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is after excellent you replace the ink but for only about the first 5070 pictures
The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of registervery frustrating when youre printing out any pictures alone let ones of your child
Yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is clean to the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion
Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with that pictures resemble something a third grader took a crayon to
In the long run I will not be buying a photo printer for home use but will rather them take to a store for processing
Qualitywise it gets you in the beginning but doesnt hold for out the long run
My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present me for
I installed and it it worked perfectly for one week
Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them such yellow as faces and hands no proper flesh tones
I call HP support and was told that my printer was out warranty of because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured not the purchase date
I was offered one call free but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had
I was given a case number but when I called HP back stating my case number they said that this was no a longer free call
I explained was it an extension of the first call but they refused to work with me
I think HP warranty policy stinks and would not purchase another HP product as long as this stands policy
But when it is forget recording about changing channels
It is really really slow and like takes forever to even receive any remote clicks
Broadband feature is nice but doesnt USB come cheap
A clock radio that you have to fumble for a to remote use
I have older the models CD Clock Radio and they are nice but the new model is irritating
I also have the IPOD and player at least the volume controls are on the system
I cant keep a system that have I to locate a remote to operate
PURCHASED I THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK
I AM A AMPUTEE DOUBLE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR
I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD RECCOMEND NOT THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE
COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO QUALITY THE
This carrying case worked well for me until I jumped in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it causing my to iPod fall to the pavement
It turns out the clip isnt fastened all on that securely
After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up I still cant get more a than 20db signal from my guitar
it Installed easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen
I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasnt been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers I only wouldnt recommend this memory for dell 700m users
Huge in flaw this product requires that it be restarted daily
This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP order in for it to stay visable to your computers
Second problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps are speeds very rare and even at 35feet from the AP the unit is around 1136mpbs
Do not buy this product find another company who behind stands there products
All of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere India in
People the on phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke
I bought the 72s Zire as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with
Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to rid get of them
Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify problems the
I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same I condition sent it to them
After my experience with this Palm I will buy never Palm again
This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting over them
We thought it was the battery going bad but new a battery didnt help
I am not going even to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
have I had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years
While some Linksys units have worked for me more I often have found them undependable
In particular the WPS54GU2 set up fine but I almost always had cycle to the power to get it to work each time I printed
THIS IS THE ONE THIRD THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR Total JUNK
I bought this HD because my Lacie which had lasted over 5 years crashed on finally me
Out the of box this product looked great although it was very large and heavy
I immediately plugged in it to test it and it came up however that was the one and only time that it booted
I tried several more times it and wouldnt boot up
VERY VERY scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data it and wont boot up out of the box
dont I know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data
I purchased this and shipped to and US finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon
Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a microphone good
I record my violin pieces on laptop my and used an ordinary computer mike for this
But I wanted a sensitive more recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike
The gain lower was than the ordinary mike it doesnt work at all without the battery but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory
sony Unfortunately doesnt have good service centres wholl entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain
SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared Vista with upgrade save for the Windows startup music
I thought this new sound card would bring my back sounds
Might have but it says not with compatible Vista
are you serious I bought this a while ago to see it if was cool
It is a piece of u junk can barely get any channels and even if you do you can barely see them and it has loud static
if you want to watch it in your car you have to cover because it the back light is too week
The item was not difficult to install but the plate adaptor did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks
I was disappointed it was NOT universal as as advertised
once I got the tv up it is ok and getting the tv to up it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady
I did find there out is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks
I had to return the first tv the to store and round up help when I got a replacement
Now it looks like I may to need do that again as the replacement tv has problems also
This whole thing with the mount and has tv been very frustrating
These Verbatim discs are hands the down very WORST blank media Ive EVER encountered Theyre made by CMC Magnetics well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world
But not only are they CMC Magnetics the theyre worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics
The latest KProbe hangs when faced these with forcing a hard reset
The latest Nero Burning ROM hangs when faced with these a forcing hard reset
The program continues nonstop to display waiting for media when I use these and an attempt to abort hangs Windows XP SP2 the same way it Kprobe hangs
Curiously media the IDs on these are exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CDR media theyre made by CMC Magnetics as well
However at least the Philips are recognized by all my and software hardware quite unlike the Verbatims
why Thats I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics
The Philips are no either prize but they perform minimally well
The ONLY thing that worked with media these are the LightScribe labeling
But whats the point of discs labeling you cant even RECOGNIZE let alone burn
I had the exact same problems with these media in both my LiteOn LH201AH burner and my NEC ND2510A burner the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for lowquality even media
Note that Verbatim had a great reputation they when sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden
But stupidly they chose to go ultracheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Corp Magnetics
I found this very be handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of
Im glad I back up my data in than more one place
Do not be fooled by the flashy picture metalliclooking
The plastic of shell this device is the quality of McDonalds toys
One would think for that 300 the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting
In order to turn the device on you have to press very firmly which is a risky thing to do considering the delicacy cracking of the shell
The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy and you have hold to the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place otherwise the connection will be lost
I am a premedical student and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product that believing I could for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk scan my science textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that way I thought I would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least 100 each
However I now that see this belief was naive to say the least
The words come out distorted a like jammed fax machine and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDFs the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate
Furthermore downloading is very slow at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer and since you cant see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer you will have to rescan 80 about of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibility
I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying product this
I have would saved myself a lot of money and time
If you are a user who is only looking to pictures scan or a few flat documents then this product may work okay for you although a digital camera will probably deliver better results
If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going allout paperless with this product will you find yourself extremely disappointed
Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semidecent shell manufacturuer will it not a good buy
The idea is wonderful and has a lot potential of especially when coupled with a Tablet PC
However the execution of the idea improvement needs
I hope see to a far better version of this product in the next few years at a price that is comparable to quality
The paper is just heavyweight paper thats perforated you so can bend it and break out the inserts themselves
which takes some effort not sure if itd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper board cutting
Reading this I can save you hour an of your precious time
No you cant make the template show up rightside
to use software the you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS
Im kidding not I guess you could also turn your monitor on its side
You can the rotate text so it shows the way it should
youll So have to turn your head or monitor back and forth sideways
What kind of company would such sell a product
if youre looking for templates for the Inserts DVD
Another thing is that there isnt a hole for the headphone which jack is rather odd
I wrongly was advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo
sure Be your computer is supported because Targus tech wont give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you cant safely maake it work with an unsupported computer
I just now read other the reviews and now consider myself lucky I didnt keep it and try to make it work
After about 3 weeks of operation the fan clicks and buzzes crazy like
I bought this product as a way keep to a large amount of backup data saved however I have fought with the drivers for days now
Whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does work not if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes even with the newest updates I will be returning this product ASAP
Im disappointed very and will not be buy netgear again
This was my second Netgear I product bought previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed The idea of a network storage appeals to me
In reading the previous reviews I found it that was a finicky thing and be careful on the drives you buy for it
Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought yesterday both
Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well but that is where everything started to down go hill
Midway through the install it tells you to any okay error messages which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors and suddenly my computer reboots
Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well and it never back goes to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot
Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101 you need to look to in your own computer
To quote Netgears web site SCSI disk drivers the from Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers
Promise drivers are typically used RAID for 1 or for SATA drives
My computer is just a week old and has these drivers newer
Back in the box the SC101 and goes I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me
Tried the 3 things when you trouble have it suggests and none work
This is where get I really frustrated Netgear support
I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own fault and Id have to pay to have that crp he yes said it from my system
I needed to hire a computer local vendor and it would be my bill
The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand and went through mood huge swings during the call from happy to argumentative to depressed to happy again
I freaked was that this person knew my home address
After reading up on it and now it experiencing I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market
really It requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
everything works fine except for two flaws Excel in on the numpad the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key
this is unacceptable had i a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games
logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small crucial yet technical shortcomings
I live in San Francisco and have good generally radio reception
This unit not could receive normal FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up
and I used the fancy Dipole antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and the table other radios only had an internal antenna
Sometimes the audio skips and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired 3 meaning or 4 second dropouts
purchased I the Recepter Radio HD a year ago used it for a weekend and returned it immediately
Even in the Denver market with lots of strong very HD signals this radio had trouble finding them
be Id listening to a strong station and the radio would lose lock go silent and rebuffer before coming back to life
This was one of the few HD radios available when I it bought
I have since purchased a Sangean HDR1 love and it
Tried this with two different computers using Vista Windows
Got message this One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it
After one successful printing it didnt work all at
This cable seemed to be recognized correctly first at but kept from being connected
What more can I say than the above It is flimsy doesnt stay in rattles adjustment around when you move and looks cheap to boot
Tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in world the
Its just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap so plastic it sticks a lot
There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count negatives as
For me I them consider annoyances but not killers
I would like to have WiFi with PDA my but I am not dead with out it
More is memory always good but the T5 isnt on the hurting side
Its not a good mp3 player with the memory has it
And even if have you a 2G card with mp3s its not like this is what you would buy for MP3s
as But far as contact information on the go applications etc
The problem as have I just found out is these are known to die
I havent heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the will T5 at some point Die
It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from it Palm will not come back to even a factory state
You will have Palm a Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top
If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make better it
This is serious a design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for
Until I ran into this I would have rated a this 45
Until this happened the device did what I expected it do to
I read the box before buying it and it knew had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi
But it has one of the fastest processors at available that time in a PDA
works well enough I havent any had issues with it
You can surf the with net bluetooth so wifi isnt really that big of a deal
But if you cant trust your device is going to be working the next day really it
I want dont to buy another Palm after this experience but I am not sure what to
First T5 lasted 6 months then just refused to start was under replaced warranty
one This locked up after about 3 months was replaced again under warranty
Its out now of warranty and wont start or reset
The 2 first times Palm told me the ROM had failed
I guess its the same problem again Im but not spending 169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5
Out of the box I think its a good PDA so check those 4 and 5 star reviews to how see long the users have had their PDAs before you buy
I bought this from headset retailer offline and returned it the next day
First off I have to it make clear that I had NO problems with sound
Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger they use drivers 40mm the sound quality of the headset was just fine
However when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come mind to are uncomfortable as sin
The awkward squarish of shape the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears and a bad seal on closedback headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation
Also I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads but it is near nowhere soft enough
in fact I litterally couldnt wear these things for more than five minutes without ears my turning red flush from discomfort
Mind you I also own a pair cheap of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either
but things these they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time which isnt good at all
Discomfort and being unable to obtain good a seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return
If your ears are tough should you have no problem with this headset
The sound quality is decent it and should work just fine for you
However if youre looking for comfort and good sound isolation youll want to elsewhere look
I recommend dont these for 1st person shooter gamers
Impossible to tell if is enemy in front or behind you
Probably ok direction if of sound is not important to you
and Left right work ok but not frontrear for some reason
The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the where point using the radio with the adaptor is pointless
On battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception lost is
I bought this card and the Belkin PreN wireless in router Nov
Everytime they asked me to reinstall the drivers software and for the card but the card never worked
I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and reinstalling drivers again again and
finally Then Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement
I pointed out that I not should have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs
I have shipped them the card defective today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive
I ordered product this June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th
I wouldnt waste my time ordering this product Amazon from
THIS SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE INK CARTRIDGE NEED I
Dear SirMadam Its difficult very to email you regarding things I cant find
you Or dont sell I am looking for HP black ink
Now you tell me which ink I No need way you can tell
Because you are NOT selling or what You site is very difficult to find Ink need I
When the screen is black between scenes and what not their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors interference from
Buy a different one this one is just up not to the task
I opted not to send it when back I read the other feedback on this page
I didnt want to lose shipping costs and not get as reimbursed the other fellow did below
Amazon is usually pretty good not this time and not this on product
Now stuck Im with a antenna I did not order nor do I want
This Vicks humidifier ultrasonic was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dads new tracheostomy
Problem is it puts out TOO much mist even at lowest the setting Weve tried everything including taping the hole but it then goes from all to nothing because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through
Of course it wasnt until we started mentioning it to the various RNs that come to take care of my dad that everyone using it for the same purpose of complains the same excessive mist problem
Ive resorted to making large hole cuts in plastic the tubing leading up to my dads mask
Not a great way to do it and just asking to be seeded by bacteria but if anyone has a better suggestion Im all for it even if it means suggesting different a humidifier
so Im paying 300 for a settop box with a 40Gb hard drive but I cant use it as a DVR Why not Also the only content I can play this on settop box is content that comes through iTunes Thats right
if it isnt in your iTunes library you can play on it the Apple TV
This means you caqn play your DVDs you cantt play saved DVD iMovie or other movie files you cant play anything unless it has been added successfullyy to your iTunes library
Also make sure you see the fine print about having to a have widescreen TV
If you dont have one you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen it wont go to the edges and be borderless so you have a tiny window to view inside a large box black
Any It pros has to be the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item
also I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my was computer also plugged into
I didnt think it would be that easy without having to configure something but was it
This will be a good product the down line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability
Right now its time to sell this on one ebay and wait a few years for something better
if this had only cost me 100 or 150 I would probably keep however it
The left palm pad keep possibly peeling from the uneven heat
This make the protection pad a lot less useful one than would
The on software the pc side doesnt work well at all
Wont list all my files and I cant get it to update changes or folders new
The remote needs a function skip to fast foward through movies
It continues to blow away any of the players media I have purchased
I read the other reviews some glowing well others
The price was right 149 50 rebate So I thought would I take a chance
I read the other reviews so have I no one else to blame but myself
First off I am only interested playing in videos from my computer so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works
I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with connections wireless
My house is fully wired with CAT5 therefore I using am this product wired not wireless
was I able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton
It found tversity the server right away and I was able to see the contents listed
Neither server tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as movie a
So for example I clicked my on Casablanca folder I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie
When VOB_1 after ended about 20 minutes it did not go to VOB_2
I needed to use the remote and manually the select next item to play
As another stated review the FF simply does not work properly
sure Oh if you press FF the movie will fast forward
If you press play while the movie is the FFwding movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB
This alone is enough of a to nuisance return the device
Which I be will doing first thing in the morning
My advice final to any prospective buyers S T A Y A W A Y
My final to advic DLink Great idea but your product absolutely sucks
Oh one more thing Someone that mentioned their tech support was very freindly
Yes the two ladies I spoke to were very both friendly their English was terrible
oh come on just one guess It also sounded like each of the tech support are personnel sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another
I could hear least at 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients
made Which it very difficult for the lady helping me
She needed to me ask to repeat myself over and over
Sheesh I must have read my phone number to her at 4 least times before she got it right
One last interesting tidbit the on packaging they mention Nero recode CE
Nero has list a of Supported Media Players listed
I will return this DLink junk and purchase one the certified Nero product instead
I bow my head in As shame I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway
It a was pain to configure and then none of the settings would stick
Whenever I changed the default password it would never let me log back into camera the without having to do a reset
Returning this item so I can get decent something
bad customer service its been almost a month and i have still not received this product
ive sent 3 emails and called twice really noone helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones
i dont even know how to the rate item because i dont have it
im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with help no
I put it into the player cassette in my car and the sounds were completely distorted
The voice constantly skips the and casette sometimes clicks
The quality of sound in my car is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers this using device
I plan on returning it if shipping cost doesnt more than the product itself
have I a DCS900W camera that failed within a year
After that I made calls 7 to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced
Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that dont seem to care about the service that much usually and after a couple of transfers the line got cut off or picked up by another layman
During conversation the line quality is bad very
After a while I just decided that 100 camera is not worth the time of calls the
I am the in process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau
Based on my experience I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things DLink from
Once you have any problem they wont just honor the waranty
I was pretty disappointed the with Tune Belt because of two main reasons
First I had take to my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt
That such wasnt a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve
But then went I to wear it for a run and the armband was too small for my arm I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training but nothing outrageous
I have would thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users
So if you have larger than biceps average say 17 amd up save your money
i bought my monitor yesterday and to found have a buzzing sound at lower brightness lt100
After having installed the unit for 43 days the suction cup snapped off plastic the mounting
This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit Flying dangerous Very
Tomtom would not replace the unit as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks beware buyer
the See TomTom forum for description and picture
ordered I this television with high hopes knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle
Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 2006 1 shipped with bad firmware
For me it meant that 15 minutes unpacking after the TV and turning it on it turned itself off and never turned back on again
Resets system resets power cycling unplugging didnt components help
A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost after immediately purchase
For them fix the was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV
I say a visit because Sharp does not cover inhouse technician visits for TVs under 32 a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that ultimately would be canceled
So here I am 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to for show it
Instead it sits at the authorized service center because Sharp obviously does not its vet service centers to make sure you get good service from them either
Im willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced 412006 before
Check the serial on number your TV if you do order one
If it begins with a 501512 601 602 or 603 immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp 1800BESHARP regardless of whether or not youre experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully while Sharps warranty is still effect in for you
i received my mp3 player with a black big spot in the middle of the screen i sent it back and it has been 23 months i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit
It was great the for first week then it made my computer crash and now I cannot get it installed again
purchased I this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase
Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware or software other products like this one
Now having problems with the is product one thing but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats
Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be for delayed an extra month
My MP3 player stopped after working 3 months I did get it to work again
Two months later the screen me told I had hardware problems
so OK I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem no go
Oh and I forgot mention to that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone
yourself Save some frustration and get something better
iriver maybe Just away stay from Creative Lab products
I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly it for
It is a piece of junk that working stopped only after a couple months
The firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there even was any music to listen to
Now I have a 200 dollar player mp3 with no music on it that will not interface with my PC
So if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a product great
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies I have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case that note the discription says sturdy padded handle NOT
5 STARS if still it had the handle or if you dont need one
no help from their support staff on phones nor QA online
I am a savvy computer type with network experience this and one for the books
This product a has known defect for serial numbers R641 and less see Logitech website
I just received my Amazon Order and it was serial R635 number
Hopefully Amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own than rather relying on its customer base
These are some of the worst ear I buds have heard since the very first ones came out
Voices are muted highs are muddy lows and are nonexistant
The ONLY redeeming is feature since they are marketed as surround sound yeah right
they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear callers my
Maybe mine broken was but I dont think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends
I connected splitter the to my sound card a TB Montego DDL with a 1 cable and then tried both a 6 and 30 cable to my stereo
Both the 6 and cables 30 delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card
I even used only the 6 30 and cables in case the 1 was bad
I think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source use to a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter
Cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic earcups but after a few months use light I lost sound through one cup then the other
In general when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless actually you have the noise cancelling unit turned on
The batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery I had in there lasted longer the than unit itself
disappointing Very but for the price this is hardly unexpected
I was happy the with noise canceling features not the best but definitely works
for Great airplane rides really helps cut out that background engine noise
My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design the first set i had brok the near earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus cheers to them
the second set broke too in a different place the deisgn of these just isnt sturdy very
Im gentle with my stuff too so either I had bad luck wtwo defective units or theyre just not well made
It is almost impossible to get a clear on picture any channel and the sound quality is poor
I bought for one my son at Christmas and it broke after a month
was Amazon great with sending a replacement in just two days before even getting the original back
But the replacement froze model up after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund
To quote an email from Amazon regarding this product As it seems that the problem with item this is more widespread than
we originally thought we are able not to send another replacement
If only I could get it print to Not to mention when I turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed
Ive tried over and over to to try print something
Ive checked my turned options it on and off and still it sits there not printing
If your looking for a portible printer you have other options I and suggest using them
I have not found any that even close come to meeting my needs
I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years and anyone had who been there knows that AFN sucks so DVDs is your only source of video entertainment
I have been trying to find a good case hold that equal number of title books as it does DVDs
But that seems to be asking to much or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly Then when you look at the furniture options everything to seems be made for function and not style at all they are generally pressboard P
I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions cause there is definately a market there out that is waiting to be satisfied
This product will not fix your disc I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made problem the worse
I ended up away throwing the CD and the SkipDoctor
This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does work not I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it
I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped 1 it
The unit has a cheap very feel especially for the price
I wasnt at surprised all when it stopped working
The PC that software you use to customize the touchscreen is crap
The touchscreen is very tedious to customize I write software for a living and I still found it cumbersome customize to the touchscreen
I cant imagine the average consumer being able to customize unit this given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PC to the remote
The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can the customize touch screen
Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications do not this buy unit
Aside from the touchscreens fagility is not sensitive enough to the and touch the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote
Did I mention the batteries did not last more than months 2 In short this product is crap
might I consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less
Whoever this produced software seems to have missed the point
There is no point in havng one client VPN on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client
It be would similar to say allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet
In my case I already two had VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network
The VPN from software Netgear stops my other VPN clients working
Added to my woes I cant tell you how often I saw the blue screen death of during my repeated software installdeinstall efforts
I am now returning both the router and the client as software this is an unusable solution
Like other users have this experienced unit is no longer functional after 18 months
The wired base is working still but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights
A few months into the year new I dropped it onto pavement and it broke
For Garmin 99 replaced it with a refurbished unit which I consider a fair price
Unfortunately the refurb unit couldnt play at directions full volume so I returned it for another refurb
This unit fell off the windshield still in its cradle and it started making that frying of sound short circuits
I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to unit the theyd look at it under warranty
I had told the what guy happened so I was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it
all Under circumstances the report you get back says the returned unit was within specifications or words to that effect even though clearly not
Units will be returned with software new keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to register even though you already have
For some the software mapping on the M3 will appear crippled
It does not allow you to load waypoints Points of Interest the and like
On the first one every time I inserted the SD card with maps Windows player or whatever its called would start up and ask me if I wanted search to the card for tunes
The fourth one has a problem common to the first one The brightness resets itself randomly zero to
The first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on but this one resets them both zero to
So you may think the unit is not turning but on its on
If youre outside you can it put in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if its dark you need a flashlight
The current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I it put in the cradle
means This I have to do the full new user routine
Touch the screen on little the plus signs to register the touch screen
Reset the time from Olathe Kansas where to I live
All contacts notes calendars and other information lost is
After Ive through gone the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where Im going but I cant load destinations from contacts as theyre gone so I have to type them all in by hand
If battery the runs out of juice the unit is dead
It forgets everything and I have to touch the screen where the signs plus are to register the screen
Reset the time from Olathe Kansas to where live I
All contacts notes calendars other and information is lost
I complained about this to support at Garmin and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and Garmin that can do nothing about it
They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to SD an card where it will not be lost
So now carry I a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data
I did learn though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you cant retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless have you told the program to save as selfextracting archives
To restore I pop out the detailed maps SD card insert the backup card navigate to the File Explorer navigate to the SD card open the contents of the SD card select the latest up back click through the restore procedure click to OK that it has finished just a minute or two with my small amount of data click to restart wait a long time for it to restart tap to get past the owner data screen enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then Im good to go
I cant do it while Im driving of course so if the unit resets on its own I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without unit the knowing where Home is which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue
The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as cant I look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am visavis the map
Im sure this is my shortcoming I and then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up which I cant do while driving
also It defaults to different displays for day and night
The night display uses a dark background and I have found that the menus for Windows the programs use a transparent background with black text
So I cant read the selections menu against the dark display
And the unit will not my save preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle
On the contacts database the unit all assumes phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe Kansas
I have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the xxx xxxxxxx format even though are they longer and dont start with an area code
In the calendar if I have meetings scheduled outside my zone time I enter them at the time theyre scheduled
Then when I get there I have the of option choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone
So I never use the visited time feature zone and the unit assumes Im still in my home zone wherever I may travel
I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have street no address but for which I have the latlong coordinates
I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads I quickly lose where I am and have to out zoom which loses the road
the On whole the directions part of the M3 is excellent
It gives good directions has reasonably up to date and maps lets you find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations
On whole the using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper
After a year of use I cant up put with it anymore
Ill take Garmins word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmins fault but I cant put up with anymore it
Ill switch to Magellan or TomTom or some unit other that isnt Windowsbased and that doesnt completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesnt randomly do a hard reset doesnt randomly set the brightness to zero and doesnt assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe Kansas
Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and from waypoints other peoples files
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I Directv have with HD 5 LNB and the signal was low
Signal was less than 60 some for of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD
The signal strength wasnt on improved the non HD receivers that I have as well
It matter didnt where I put them in relation to the dish and receiver
However I was removing plastic the tips which need to be changed every several months and the headphones broke
company The has only a oneyear warranty so I was outofluck
Again I thought the sound was great but for this price I would expect them to more be durable
Also the earpiece can a be bit uncomfortable at times
Just received radio yesterday and am radio returning today Pluses
adequate LCD display and illumination good while on AC adapter
However the volume slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of 56 is there a BIG noticeable increase in volumenot good and while tuning shortwave bands every approx 100Khz increment there appears to be a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speaker
Also on FM if hands are near the radio the signal breaks upfor weaker signals not strong ones and compared to my Grundig 400PE which I feel the sensitivity is not good the and hiss is bothersome the Eton E5 seems worse still I am returning this today and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead
Eton E5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if comparing it another to similar size radio and then comparing it to my Sony 2010
After about 3 months of light use it is stuck 45 in rpm mode
I sometimes use thumb my to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode
Dont buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning in garbage which case this is right your alley the Garbage Alley
I wouldnt even give this to a because bum I would feel bad about it
After buying this product I opened the case after few days as I was out of country to use this stick memory in my camera or other devices
However every time I put it in the camera or other devices it gives error doesnt and work
I couldnt use this memory stick since I bought it and as I opened box the almost 15 days after the receiptI am not sure how I can even return it back either
Basically not at all happy with the at product this time
The light makes computer my very sluggish even when my laptop is not running off of the battery
Browsing the internet especially is slow painfully and I am on a highspeed cable connection
After owning a Ptouch labeler for found yearsI the need for a more duable label than my M tape was providing
What mistake a The only thing well designed about this unit is its abilty to waste more tape than it uses If you print a label of any sizecount on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it At 20
00 a rollprepare to be screwed each time you the push print button
Then go find the scissors and cut the excess offso the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk But cheer up you can six push buttonsevery timeto reduce the margin to narrow
This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the labeland print two small dots on the other sidethis will show you where to cut it with your scissorsto the match narrow side
Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY timeAnother great featureit will use same the amount of tape regaurdless of print sizeso you will only print large print
I used to lots make of labelsand now I only make labels for VERY important items
And only I when am up to getting mad for doing so
I really wish amazon would allow us to give items negative a five stars You have been warned
While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features Ive especially enjoyed the handsfree function on handsets the weve found it to be extremely unreliable
screen the on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use
the handsets go out of range when one takes them only a modest distance from the base even though we have the base in the middle of our house the handsets dont work at the ends and our is house not that big
the handsets randomly become from unregistered the base and have to be reset this has only become a problem in the past month
The issues weve had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone usually wed expect such a to purchase last longer than two years
I bought this phone for the features great and because Ive had good luck with other Motorola products
The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about only the redeeming quality that they have
The handsets frequently lose connection with the unit base
The only way to get them again working is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings
Range on the handsets only is mediocre I cant talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located
Overall the phones are very disappointing I and would definitely recommend not buying them
Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout house because wife Patricia in wheelchair and on oxygen 247
She could all beep phones in emergency and I would hear
First sound terrible second after 1 month most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls third phones quite often in searching mode when up picked for use
Entered house to find unconcious wife and not breathing
SEARCHING Stopped CPR and ran to another room for brand different phone and called 911
Patricia DIED in spite of my and 911 efforts personnels
Looking for someone I hate to these give 5 phones my last Motorola product
There should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying pieces both
The page from which I both ordered pieces was unclear and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer
I to had return the changer and buy the one that matched the player
I know Ill be refunded the price of first the changer
by But then the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished
I received real the changer a few days later but lost the speakers
I Amazon think owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss
In general Ive been happy with Belkin accessories but cable this is the pits
It lasted less than month a I used it to connect my HDDVR cable box to my receiver
No crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days my audio went from to spotty noticeable gaps to nonexistent
I dont like to support the Monster Cable hype but of because their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one
After these using radios two months I can say that battery life is poor
Perhaps my batteries didnt come in condition good
10 mile range is not true a in normal environment open sea or desert perhaps
After receiving this DRUM which was listed as a having 25000 yield capacity on 121106
Today 11507 my printer is giving me the same error DRUM message NEAR END There was no indication when I purchased this product that it would be refurbished
The transmitter works but is it of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do
I knew better but I did it anyway thinking that it would be a good compromise we have IBM Dell and Toshiba and laptops a Sony Really Nice Monitor
No modem port not a surprise but would have been nice the video display is you well can see stuff on the monitor
mouse The runs on a delay of 12 seconds and is unacceptable
I switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised expected and
I tried 3 of these DVDRs none of them worked errors every in burn
I used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly so it is definately a problem with these DVDRs and not with burner my
ive come expect to a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse
the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface and i mean very or slight on one that is too shiny the laser wont track right
i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didnt it test well enough
unless your willing to do that skip this one it is of not the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice
i know everyone is doing what they can to cut but costs at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul
typical Shouldnt have bought a generic memory Serves me Anyway right
I purchased this product and couldnt get it to work on PC a laptop or pda cingular 8125
Not only does it register not in any SDMiniSD card reader but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD one fewer to thing carry
Well about six months after opening this item I noticed that my iPOD running was on battery
One of the contacts had broken and the device was working not anymore
I am disappointed but should have expected that the for 10 I spent
The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at product the reviews
I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my call phone
Ive decided to my cut losses and buy a different card
Wristpad to seemed comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wear and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface
I just couldnt suggest anyone else spent 15 on a mousepad that isnt to going last them
I put this cover on immediately after I opened my iPod reading after how easy they are to scratch
Ive never had my iPod without the cover on it and have had 3 it weeks
I now have iPod an covered with distracting scratches on the screen
Have a second Generation ipod so If this is not the product for you
After buying my new green ipod I needed something to protect it so I bought the Speck Nano SkinTight Delux Holster with
I tried but the only way to it fix was to cut part of it off dont do this
I sugest making sure the product detail includes second the generation
Do not order item this if you want a DVD player with a 5 inch screen
You will a receive small orange colored player with a 3
We had this printer less than 6 months before cartridge the slider began to jam
We would get error an message and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while
We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program I after had to ask to speak to a supervisor
The tech support wanted us to install a ink free cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again
ink The cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam
Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that the pulls cartridge carrier back and forth and for now the unit is working
We still havent addressed the excessive ink which leak probably has something to do with the jamming problem
I hope HP reviews on comments this website occasionally
I would like them to know have I believed in their printers and used them successfully for years but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position
Also HP tech is support very difficult to deal with at best
I talked to several overseas tech support reps spoke that almost unintelligible English
I am one consumer willing to pay little a more for a product that is well supported
Easy setup but cares who when the end result is a very slow video
Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movie Mask The
When he whips his from head side to side and you see the blur THATS what you see with this webcam Dont waste your money
This couldnt sucker pick up a single channel not even one less than 10 miles away
The case looks great and fits well but its nearly impossible remove to
I had to insert a credit card the between latches and pry for a long time
I was afraid of hurting both case the and the iPod
In addition its too wide in case the to dock in my Logitech speaker system
I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case for off docking
Although the RS receiver doesnt have TV reception cares who
it is 12 the price PLL digital 3 DXLOC speaker switch and
Bought it for my wife the pink just match didnt anything in my wardrobe
She uses her player the for gym and treats it somewhat rough
This case doesnt protect the screen from scratches see most other reviews but it hasnt fallen off while worn shes it either
The only drawback to this case is there is screen no protection
It is nice that it has a clip and it fits mp3 the player snugly but
Would be nice if it has a clear to window protect the screen
According to SysInternals Process Explorer both HWI hardware interrupts and DPC deferred procedure calls tend to run to 340 each while this card installed is both drop to under 1 once its removed
Both remain under 1 while using another manufacturers 802 USBbased
Im given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates indicate often buggy drivers but Ive found no useful driver update info on DLinks web site last I looked
That other b adapter BTW gives better throughput than this bg card DLinks of
Does not consistently work I have toshiba a a15 Win XP Pro and sometimes this works but usually it doesnt
Lately it either works or perfectly it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer
It used to have problems where i would restart the computer it and would say card not found which forced me to reload the driver
But its lately just been giving me a blue screen
have I used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues
DLink needs support to their faulty product with a new driver Bad customer service
I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my wireless Microsoft mouse
I do not have the original packaging otherwise I would taken have in back
The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back I often have to pry it out with a coin a or credit card
If mouse the is left unattended for any length of time I cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons
The ONLY thing that is works using the wheel to scroll
The really bad part is that it to seems behave this way until I unplug the receiver
I thought this was because I was using a I Mac experienced the same behavior on my PC as well
Im going to throw this away since I would not wish it on enemy my
It looked but good not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
Overall item this works as expected but requires to be reset i
The ends comming are off this cable doesnt meet the normal Belkin standards
We got the hdmi cables but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on website the
The cables come without any packaging and there no is indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website
We not have yet used the cables yet and were not sure whether they will work or not
Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C the battery discharges and quickly wont take a full charge
The next step was to do a reset hard of the Tungsten C and Im hoping it will take charge
It worked OK for 2 months but the KB kept on off falling
When I complained I was told that the KB was not compatible with my v37 Viewsonic
Yet it was advertised compatible as with the VS PPC 2002
The worse came when I upgraded to and PPC2003 the KB stopped working
I contacted Targus and was told that they do have not plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC
Works fine on Windows XP but does not work well Linux with
Ive been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own for kernels most of that time and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux
My built in 10100 NIC was much faster than this card go would
Ended getting up an Intel gigabit card that of course works with no issues
Save yourself some headaches and stay away from card this if it is destined for a Linux box
I just bought these to compare to my pair V20s of and they just suck in comparison
The Bass is non existent in comparison and the highs and mids sound tinny absolutely
Any sort Equilizer of work resulted in immediate distortion
These look nice and are compact but the sound is not good all at
The fact that they are expensive more than the competition is just appalling
I did not in notice the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer
Since most new computers use USB for serial interface the usefulness of this unit limited is
My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with product this
serial The cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package
So dont you see it prior to opening the package
Once the package opened is it is a mess that probably cannot be returned
Lastly this is one of the worst packaging jobs have I seen
The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that think I the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors
Remote isnt very responsive and the display is WAAaay too bright will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person and the interface user is terrible
The thing gets lousy reception and in general there is a reason why this is always the lower iPod priced type radio on websites
They are trying to rid get of it because it s_cks
I bought alarm this clock today April 7 2007 at Bed Bath and Beyond for 10
I bought it because of the product name small size variety and of options
I Unfortunately realized it wasnt a great buy when I brought it home
and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the would clock stay on
The connections appear to be very sensitive the and battery doesnt stay in place
Its supposed help to you see the time in the dark but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry
Actually the screen is in blurry most positions even with the light off
youre If a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment this is not the clock for you
Youll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it your under ear
final A note on this product The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems
If I close the cover all the way clock the shuts off
If you want alarm an clock that will last awhile I suggest buying something else
I wanted convert to an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer
though Even instructions from the manual was followed the printer did not work
The customer support is claimed be to 247 but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet
So customers naturally can expect better customer service and better response time
tried I several times to contact Sandisk including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response
My wifes Cruzer just failed as well the power light comes on it is recognized by XP and the light goes out the system cant ID the so device its useless
It does the same thing on of all the XP systems in our house
Ive front tried side USB connections rear connections and hub connections
And I was going to another order 100 for the office
THANKS BUT AMAZON THE PHOTO DOESNT GIVE IT ANY CREDIT
DONT THESE COME WITH A PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO
THE WHERES PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
I ordered item this because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices all had the same description and specs
friend A with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose
Since then it has come loose twice more so I just dont use anymore it
When it worked it worked fine but it is best at an inexpensive and temporary solution
I just purchased this item now Im planning return to it tomorrow
One the of advertised features the ability to store liner notes just doesnt work properly
They just dont into the pocket without bending andor forcing in them
To me the liner notes have value and Im willing not to fold spindle or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on pulling and the built in antenna up
The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna broke base inside the radio
I am looking to return this as item it is not designed right
I cannot comment on the reception as the antenna broken is
Overall its a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on materials the
Machine started making loud grinding noises when started or printing while
Showed to it a repair shop says the fuser is a toast
Died just after one year so have to bear expense the
Beware i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one this with problem
our MFC 8840DN worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine damage caused that couldnt be fixed by the sales technician
Lots of waiting for a response from Brother at their call website in
Will never buy from Brother or Amazon again as a of result this
The buttons dont have that clicky button feel so you press and youre did like it go
The labels are hard to read icons take a figuring little out
Honestly I use it for turning onoff and if I want to do anything else I go to up the iHome to adjust it
My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb Video iPod
60gb The model is thicker than the 30gb and this case wont close around the 60gb iPod
A secondary complaint is that though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod shocks from there is no protection for the screen
Its just a hole in the case like the hole for using the wheel and I just require more protection for video my iPod
A third minor complaint is that theres a nonremovable knob on the back of case the for attaching the belt clip and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket
Im returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the too screen
I live in Washington DC so I generally get a signal outdoors when
Using these headphones did yield not an increased signal for me
Now the good news they do get decent reception I tried them my in office in NYC which has a northern exposure and it got good reception
I experienced too the Blue Screen of Death on my laptop which has XP pro on it
I had to uninstall the card in software order to stop my system from continuously rebooting
On another note the install of the router was regardless GREAT
I didnt get anywhere with the Tech support group and to had return everything
After printing just a few pictures the color the on photo turns to pink and yellow
Put in a new cartridge and will it work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again
Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image but it is slow and cartridge the runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos
This printer has been a piece of since garbage the day I bought it
I dont know why I kept trying as the purchase was made a about year ago
It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would cut have my losses instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink
I have never gotten more than one picture in row a without an error message turning the printer off turning it back on doing that several times and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day
Now it says the cartridge should be replaced when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures which would add up to claim the of 100 per cartridge
The thing ironic is the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful
But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of two about hours
This is the last time I try use to the printer it is finally going in the trash
com brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a EasyShare Kodak printer my motherinlaws
The photograp resulting was horrible it had a very green tint to it
I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer the green remained tint
I checked the troubleshooting section the of manual checkedcleaned the print heads and still the problem remained
Given that the product is still the on market I suspect I had a broken unit
I have only had batteries the for a short time but they are working great
I have recharged all three sets 4 per set times three each
thats what taks to run my PowerShotS2I2 Canon cameraall good news
I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep going me for about 6 hours
But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keep me in the for field the day
do I alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches
These are batteries really good they have never let me down as of yet thats why I will be getting more
it says its an dock AV for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv
what a waste AV cables that sell for are 20 incredible
they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the inputs av of my tv
I was very disappointed I when received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables
Cables that you can up pick at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper
The Airport Express itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the miniRCA cable and a quick search online the for optical to mini
I dont like this mouse i brought and never its work useles
screen Klear has to be the absolute worst product Ive ever used
I was stupid and used it my on primary display first instead of using the 5050 isopropyl alcoholwater mix thats far superior to klear screen products
My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that will simply not come out
My 3 year old laptops display looks perfect nearly because I only used the 5050 solution on it my 2001fp looks horrible now
I am using two other remotes PhilipsMagnavox that are far more convenient and operate better
This one does not look like the picture which looks like more the 425 model
It does not cover the equipment I have while 425 the model does Its learning mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least
Conclusion This would make for a nice ornament It does look nice if and you are lucky you may be able to control some devices
I bought this product to replace a HP previous allinone printer I had
This is by far the worst printer I have owned ever
It does not like paper photo it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced
merchandise to returned vendor by shipper as damaged in shipment
