When I tried to switch gels covers it comes with 3 different sizes the entire earpiece came off in my hands
The ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ears starts to really hurt from it
The sound quality is TERRIBLE People I am talking to sounds very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volumes setting on my Motorola v300
What is worse people I am talking to hear me very poorly
They say there is so much background noises it sounds like I am in a noisy bar even when Im just sitting in my car
People can barely hear me over the backgrounds noise racket
Beware The Product Features for this product specified
I selected this model because of the advertised features
I returned the item and was charged for the return shipping
I emailed them notifying them that it was their faults for falsely advertising a features that was not part of the product
In the online return process theres no options that states the return was a result of Amazon
Basically they falsely advertise so that you buy the product and when you discover its not the right one youres screwed
I now understand all those complaints Ive read about Amazon
Ill take the loss this time but I wont repeat my mistake and orders from them again
This review is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon
I couldnt use the product so sorry I couldnt give a review about it
I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for 29
I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have
I see now you can no longer find these for sale and gees I wonder why
I probable used this items a totals of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic
and after only 8 uses a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well
While using it the phones cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plugs and stuck it back in after a while you just gave up causes it doesnt work
coms but have not tried to calls them yet and had no results with the emails
I have a feelings I lose anyways with this purchase
The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones Iknow the ones I got with the phone stinks due to the fits but al least it was free and still works top notch
To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived
Mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working
I went through 2 of these in as many months the sounds quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working
People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phones couldnt even distinguish between yes and no
Design is great and very comfortable but sound qualities is poor people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled
However after a months or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the booms enters the ear piece
I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strains on the plastic
The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stresses
I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear its unobtrusive and light
However I constantly get complaints from whoever Im talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet
I have to speechified up louder than normal and cup my hand around the backs of the microphone in order to produced an acceptable volumes which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset
The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouths
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me
Its a bit hard to making the earbud stays in my ears and forget about jogging wearing this
Also the inserts comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrowing it and has different sizes of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert
Sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end
Apparently you need to quotknowquot your technical specs Universal does not mean Nokia so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesnt works with Nokia I get the expense of sending it back
This should been on the technical specs which are crap on this site
I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesnts works well sometimes it has connection bluetooth but most of the time it doesnt work
Yeah its a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one
I purchased a brands new Samsung t809s and right out of the box the batteries cover would not stay on the phones
I went to a genuine TMobile retailers and after working on the phone for a good halfanhour they were still unable to gotten the batteries covers to fit
The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal batteries cover to fit
after six weeks of hassling them over the issues the end result was that the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty
What End results I get to duct tape my battery in places
If youre going to spending serious money on a high ends phones
go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product
I got this phone basically for free but even taking that into accounts Im pretty disappointed with the phone
This is my first Samsung and Im pretty sure my last one I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I betrayed it
From now I wouldnt got anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe SonyEricsson
So here is a short list of those little things that make your life with this phone and its combination with TMobile annoying
its not really comfortable to openclose the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumbs on the screens which leaves is greasy all the time
putting a comma while writing a text message capitalizes the next words what is the logic in that it annoys me because is do use text messages a lots
you can only save 1 phones type for each category what if the people has 2 business phones
you can not choose the emails addresses of a people from the contacts list when you want to sending a picture message to an email address
And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through like it wouldve been in a Nokia even in a model 5 years old
Oh yeah and TMobile really contributed to the greatness of this phone removing some of the features and limiting others like setting your mp3 as a ringtones although there is an easy hack around it just change the extensions from
I cant believe that with technologies as advanced as it is Samsung could produce this giant POS
I actually refused to pay the bills and let them shut my service off
I loved the clarity of the pictures even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy and I even liked the video feature
But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT Its been years since Ive had such lousy reception from a phones
Im considering taking the dealers to court over this since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was
Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for
Between the missing features no voices dial on a 200 phones crippled features I have to bought ringtones use their tzone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already and poor receptions and terrible batteries life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fees and find another carrier
Anyones who would charge some much for this POS really doesnt deserve my business
Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone
They are incredibly cheaply made and when my wife gave them a tries she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call
Essentially unusable unless we find some tricks that we have missed so far
I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk
They worked but never well for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit
I agree with most of the others it worked okay for a couple of months
now not only does it not charge my phone but if I plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charges Its also always falling out of the lighter plug
I dont have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets
Although this chargers is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr the phone complains that this an Unauthorized Charger and it will not charge the phones
When I plug the phone in it says Unauthorized Charger and refuses to charge at all
It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a charger
I give it one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars
I suppose that would are bad for business but it is what it is
Avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing
Maybe it works in China but not in North America
Have since bought a Motorolabrand ones for three times what I paid for this pieces of junk
Do not isn't attracted by a cheap prices tag because you get what you pay for or what you DONT pay for in this case
This razr car charger only worked for about 1 week then quit working
The Premium Vehicle Power Charger was not compatible
Motorola one is far better in quality as well to use
The product descriptions should states that it does not work with the Verizon V3C When plugged in it states Unauthorized Charger and will not charge at all although if the battery is dead it will give you enough juice to speechify but it still wont charges
These are not the same that come on the earbud and are not easy to use or to hear from
I had an old pairs they were green that worked great but I lost one
Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds they split open all three pairs If youre plannings on using these for your ipods headphones look into the older colored ones I believe theyre a different material and less prones to cracking
The service was good but the product didnts have enough infoes for me to make a wise decision
At the end I couldnt use the product on my jabra ear piece
The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice
They did hold the buds in the ear better but no gains in sound quality
If you want the small and med Ill sending them to you for shipping
I have ear gels before but none that were this cheap and I dont mean cost
There was no consistencies in the size they come in different sizes but no two were the same
And without fail every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece
Every one It didnt seem to matter if they were small or larger or even larger than the ear pieces
The materials just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance
I am sure there must be a better qualities version of these things somewhere
As others have mentioned the front window blanks out almost immediately and even worse it doesnt show your missed calls
It does not having any exterior lights such as my old Samsung that showed when it was charging when charges completed when a voice mail was waiting etcs
While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minutes
No Im not driving but Im a passenger trying to use my phones
Cingular is a light pastel pink TMobile is magenta dark pinks
The one thing I like is that this phones is a quad band and if you travel interationally it will be great
I just got the phones so havent used it interational yet
Oh it must TMobile to get international service
The phone has a cameras plus other tech features but I dont use them
I want my phone only to be a phone no other gadgets
I would never buy this phone again and as soon as Im eligibles for an upgrades this phone is history
I doubt I would gets a Motorola ever again Ill sticks to Samsung
Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call
not just dropped the call I mean the phone shuts off Then I would try and starting it again no goes So I had to take the batteries out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
Half of the time it would start and saying invalid battery and I would start the entire processes over again
I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features except BETTER reception and an MP3 player
My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his
Ive always had perfectly serviceable but boring cells phones and when I saw the pinks Razr I knew I wanted one
I saved my pennies and gave myself an endofschoolyear present
I have only had this phone for a month but I am horribly disappointed
It has horrible receptions and I know its not the network because I tested it sides by side with other tmobile phones and drops more than half of my calls
It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME in the middle of conversation while in your pocket whenevers
I went back to tmobile and they are sending me a new Samsung but Im sorts of disappointed that my pretty pink phones didnts live up to expectations
Sometimes It is the companys mistakes and they still blame it on the customer
Since I started my plan I had a problem reciving my bill on time
So the company started charging me 5 late fee for four consecutive months
Also when I tried adding additional features such as their textmessagebundle the change on the account did not take effect till two days later and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two daysand It costed me an additional 4
Every times I tried complaining to their customers services they just wouldnt listen
I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximized their profit
More than once if I stay longenough on the line they put me on mute so they dont have to listen to my complainings
I feeling that I am being treated like dirts not like a customer
I had the worst customerservices experiences with tmobile
Also the receptions is not the best in the country
I had friends who were using the same phones as the one I have but different networks and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amounts of money
I purchased this item for use while driving my cars in Oct of 2005 for 29

Also the reception is not the best in the country
I had friends who were using the same phones as the one I have but different networks and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amount of money
The product itself would hasn't worked great if they included all the pieces
I then requested a cord and WebTreo said they would mail one to me immediately but none came
I emailed their customers services again and have received no response
The case blocks the cameras eyes and the clip lasted one week
Whereas the bodies glove cosmetically looks good it has a diabolical flaws inherent in its POOR design
The attachment button that is mounted on the rears of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belts clip is seriously defective
The plastic buttons resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove
The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connectors to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic gloves
The pocket stretches As soon as any pressure is applied to the phones when it is hanging on your belts like when you sit down or bump anythings the connector easily and silently dislodges from its elastic pockets Your valuables cell phones drops to the ground and you have lost it You have lost your phone but the buttons is still attached to your belt clip
This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of
Ive only had it for 3 months the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used
The swivels spins freely now and no longer rachets
The cover for the screen housings gets in the way of the camera it has to be held down away from the lense
Body Glove needs to send this one backs to the engineers
I never got my order even after a months after I placed it
Ive previously had subscription cell phone services with a varieties of providers but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for
A prepaids phone service seemed like the ways to go and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternatives because the prices was competitive and minutes dont expires
I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone
It arrived however defective the ports for recharging the phone was damaged
Per the STI Mobile web site I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacements phones
This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service
In the first one the rep told me that I was mistaken and must have been sent the wrong charger
No offer was made to replace the charger strangely which was included as parts of the package deal
After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in facts have the right charger I took the phone in to a local merchant who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical models phone it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective
At this points the reps apologized and told me I would has to contacted Samsung for a replacement phone This entire process took several weeks
If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone providers
It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off
Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytimes I disconnect it from the holders
There are better holsters for the RAZR on the market
I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone except they sent me this flip phone V171
I liked my candies bars phone and didnt want this flip pieces of junk
I was happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phones failings and then things quickly went downhill
Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phones even though I had minutes available on the old phones
I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phone which works awesome with no problems
She had to always type in the areas codes for all numbers dialed even the local numbers
She also had problems trying to dial a numbers and the phones would not dials after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send
My recommendation is to stays away from this phones and this service
Go shop Cingular for all the great deals they have
service is terrible no good ringtones my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates
Dont get it You will ending up paying the same if you have a plan
I agree on it was too good to is true statements for this package
The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap
charger melted in the car after a sunny day I couldnt even test it
Earphone qualities is not good as well giving a constant humming noise
The case and ear bud are fine but the cars charger I was sent doesnt even fit my Nokia 6230
Of course I wasnt expecting any name brand stuff here but at least I expected them to all work
I dont know if I got a bad earbuds or what but it adds static and noises and therefore can not be used
The cases I didnt need but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed
I think Ill go spend some extra money and get a brands names earbudheadset though
I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala500 and used it all about maybe 5 times
Why such a short amount of time Because the sound qualities heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in facts I am in the car with the windows up and radio off
Its a bits too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on the other end can hear me
Now I keep this pieces of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power
If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere
The only good thing about this headsets is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cells phones
Think twices about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first
The one stars was for the eases of setting up with my cell phones
As soon as I bought it I realized it doesnt hold the phone too well
Few days later my concerns proved them selves every time I made a rapid movement or tried to ran with it even very carefully the phones would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground
Every time I was lucky to realized as soon as I droped it untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me
There goes a 200 phone lost because of a stupid 10 holsters
Do not buy this product if you realy needs a holster go with somethings like Sonyericssons ICE26 that secures the phones with an extra flap on tops so it dosnt slip out of the holster
As for me I gatta getting me a new phones shame I had the Z520 cells phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it
It is too thick to worked with the Seidio Cradle I have so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo
The skin buttons do not always lines up with the TREO buttons so I misfire applications
The holsters is a jokes as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the cards every time I pull the phone off the holster
Do not place the phone in your pocket with the skins on unless you need to see the insides of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly
I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement however I was disappointed
While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment after the first days it looks like its two years old
If you have an SD card in your Treo forgets it the belts clip will pop your card daily
And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt
Dont even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the nonslip covers wonts begin to slidden into your pocket
If youres in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover but for the rests of us
Works pretty well with the unit but the belt clip SUCKS Its big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa
I missed the reviews before I ordered I shouldnt have bought it
considering the quality of the headset I didnt even try the car charger in the fear that it wouldnt following the necessary battery charge cycles
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE I have had this phones for 6 months and I am SO disappointed Of course it worked for the first 30 days within the graces period but then I began having problems with keeping the batteries charged
I took it to the local Sprint store and they gave me a new battery
That worked for a few weeks but just recently Ive started having the same problem
I just spent over 2 hours on the phone of course not MY phoneIs had to use my work time with Sprint and Sanyo
Of courses neither company was willing to standardize behind the product so now I have to send the phones at my expense of course to Sanyo to has it repaired which will take two weeks at least
So please do yourselves a favors and picked out a different phone
I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years
Just recently without any warning whatsoever they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account
pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that periods of times
Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever
I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered not only could they not do that but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me So my advice DONT TRUST SPRINT Again this happened with any warning It could happen to you too Trust me avoid Sprint at all costs I should hasn't
the menus buttons are inconviently placed such as the My content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling
its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone
Second and more important MY PHONE DOESNT WORK WITH IT ON The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone preventing any usage of the entire phone
It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily
I tried to cancel the order but they said it has been shipped
I was cancelling on October 13 2006 but the package labeled that it was shipped on October 17 2006
How can it being shipped 4 days after it was shipped
See other reviews on the problems w the leathers case
I havent tried the handsfree devices and probably wont bother but the cases is cheap looking and the charger didnts works at all
As they say you get what you pay for Im going to an actual stores and gotten a real Motorola accessories kits
I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewers ear
I figured at this price Id tries for my wife and I
When I first tried them on I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on
Even with the provided clips these fall out and youre better off not using them
Frustrating that all these cell phones companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones
Two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive
Unfortunately the headsets jack is not a standard jack but instead one uniques to Samsung phones
Therefore you are forced to buy Samsungs headset
What makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrops of about an inch and half that connects to the cord
Any pressure or movements on the teardrop say from clothings or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear
I hope that Samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jacks that will allow you to use regular headphones
I think this is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had
It just doesnt seem like its Nokia qualities to me
I would gets the Samsung slider if I could do it all over again
Battery life is subpar sliders seems cheap and breakable speakerphone is not loud enough
The interface is pretty smooth but thats about it
If you have to have a simple interface then this might works but otherwise Id get the Samsung
I got this phones cause I thought it would be a nice little phones
Too little This phones is not made for someone who has med to large fingers
The voices dialing DOES NOT WORK It is hard to use
I returned the phones after only 2 DAYS I got the Samsung T629
Does almost everything the Nokia does but is better looks better performs much better
If you are a teenagers this phone may be good for you
It was broken in a few days of use you should buy a hard cover insteas
This headset is NOT compatible with the Nokia E62 The Nokia E62 has a 2
5mm headphones jack and not the pops ports shown on this accessory
For 4 its not bad but within two weeks the black paints started coming off to reveal the white plastic looks horrible but if you dont cared how the cases looks then this is the case for you
It also takes the nice designs of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phones really hard to opening and then snapped off when you do
This case also hinders comunications maks you sound really muffled to the people on the other ends of the line
This things doesnt slide well and the fronts cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you dont ever open your phones this is the cases cover for yoes
Well I was wrongits was twenty dollars completely wasted
I could not gets the thing to stays put the boom mike is so bottomheavy that it wont stay close to my cheeks even sitting still And it pokes out about 3 feet to the sides of my head it seems like it anyway if I am moving around at all Almost like it was DESIGNED to get as far away from my voice as possible
But even holding the stupid thing with my hand did not help the sound quality
I got constant complaints that I could not be heard very well
There are only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating
Second its a decent quality just pisspoor designs
And three I liked that when I clicked the button not due to incoming calls it automatically launched the voice dial menus so I could really make a call without ever touching my cell phone
I guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfrs for both headset and phones
But it fails miserably at its primary designs goal so I heartily recommend staying away from this product
Saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece so I took it
The installations was a little tricky at first but once i got it paired with an LG Chocolate it was functional
Tested it out all over the houses and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet
Used it driving and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels
This products alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrptions BY ITSELF
When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things which it doesnt do they pointed out where it says may require 3rd parties software for various uses
I just didnt know that the definition of various was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED
I would rate my experiences with this seller as Dissapointing
At least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere
I have owned every brand of this types of cables over the years
The cables will develop a bare spot near the devices connectors end and shorting itself out
For some reason it only happens with the Palmtype cables
Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hotsynching andor charging daily
My first peeves was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable but my major issues is that a few weeks of uses were enough to break one of the little tab that holds the contacts firmly in place so WATCH OUT and treat this cables nicely
I like the retracting cable concept but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant saw anything in the outer windows especially in the suns light
So you cant see whos calling or what time it is without opening the phones
Its my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers
Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Not to mention the facts that bumping into somethings can oftern knocked the phone out of the holster
While it does allowanced the phones to swivels thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated I ended up being the stabbing victims of the belt clip instead
Not to mention the wears and tear from the phones hitting the pavement
Im shopping for a holsters and faceplate as we speak
While this is a functional holsters be aware that you may like me find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holsters
You can turn off the answer phone when opened option but that is not preferred by everyone
You may also find that the phone does not stay in the holsters securely
I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would aren't a good company
I have never been treated so rudely by customers service people in my lives
In multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twices
I ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money
Im writing a review for the first time because Ive never been so dissapointed with a shoppings experiences
I bought cell phones cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts
It took them until December 19th to confirming that they were being shipped It was as if they were waiting for the last minutes to ship me my items
Amazon has a two week policies for shipment of products
Needlesses to say I did not gotten to give them away as Christmas gifts
This is the type of services I got for choosing standard shipping which was very expensive to send two little cells phone casesI cant specifies how much because they wont let me post prices in reviews They also shipped them seperately
One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelopes and the other in a huge box
Ive decided to not returned the items because I want to cuts my losses now and just never order from them again
Great concept protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches
The rubberies material tends to collects all sorts of dust and lints
Its very hard to get it off unless you wash it with water or uses tape to peel it off
The protective cover doesnt fit around the screens too well
Mine tends to aren't stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right even if I try and reposition the unit itself
The plastic screen covers that can aren't removed was already scratched due to the way it is packaged
Its now sitting on my desk at works collecting dust
My husbands and I found these cases for our new SLVRs and were excited
Unfortunatly like others we have found that they dont fit our phones
We have the right style SLVR the case just doesnt fit
I purchased this crystal case to protecting my new slvrs L7
The case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone
This phone case is the worse one ever for the TREO 650
Yea the color is great but if you just tap it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit eases
You have to lift it up so now you have a pieces of 2 cent plastics over a five hundred dollar phone
Now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screens to protect it
Quote It attaches easily and I especially like the screens covers most cases dont have this if you drop the phones and cracked the screen youre hosed
Insurances If you invest in a five hundred dollars phone then you must have insurance on it
Final I am very disappointed in the covers and recommend that you invest in another products leathers
I bought this item hoping to haven't somethings different
I really should have tough about this one and this is a warnings to others
I bought three of these at once and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3
5mm headset for listening to musics but they didnt handle calls at all everything is full of static listening and talking
I just placed a calls with it and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connections was terrible but it was the adapter that was the problem full of static and echo
It was functional it felt solid and it had a nice low profile look
However after around a year and a halves the continued act of openings and closing the phones has caused the hinges to crack and to gradually breaking off completely
I now have to hold the phones together with my hand while I talk which is extremely awkward
This is especially frustrating given the rest of the phones is so well made
Furthermore it seems to has unfortunately failed just before my upgrade opportunities in a couples of months and right after my purchase of some extra accessories batterieschargers
Search around online for a670 hinges and you will find a lots of other people with problems like mine
This in itself wouldnt be a problem if Samsung would willingly replace the phone
However they are not claiming it as a design defect and neither Samsung nor Verizon are offering to replaces it
Bad form for both although perhaps Verizon isnt as much to blame
I would avoid both Samsung and this phone because of this incidents
This phone is seemingly designed to be durable but it frankly is not meant for the long haul and is too pricey given its average performance
It didnt have many features so its just a waste of your money
I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again
I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the boxes colletings dust
this battery is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670
when you put it in it reads bad batteries on the screens and will go no further
I dont know about other company but Accessory Export will sell you the products that is totally different from the pictures
I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3 but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some forms of soft plastics
Not only that the cover smells like petroleum oils
This is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of your phones
The outside is a faux leather made of plastic that looks convincing enough
Although the beltpocket clip held my Treo securely it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way
After a cople of days the star shaped pieces on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a times
My old Tracfone quit working so I purchased a new one
Ive been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfones
Its been a nightmareafter 4 weeks 3 new sim cards and countless calls to TracFone customers service reps Ive accomplished nothings
My phones is still not activated I still dont have my old number transfered and Ive wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps
Got it home put in the sim card add the battery and changed the phone
Once it was charged I went to activate the phone it said insert sim
I redid several times called support got the run around becaused it did not understands my error
When I got a person she said the same thing after 15 minutes of trying to insert a cards where there was no place for a card the lady said they would have to sends me a new phones mind was broke
So we will see if the new one is better next week when it comes
Weve had 3 of the LG1500 in our families plan for nearly a year
When calling our son I would get a message that his number was blacklisted
After calling Cingular several times we demanded new phones
We were told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing
If a phone doesnt works the company needs to gets rid of them
I got the phone because it was small but I didnt know Id be sacrificing so much
The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text messages inbox fills up basically every day
I get shoddy services and while i do like the design there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can seeing thru to the casings
All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but its not really the best for what youll want to do with your cell phones
I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards
The phones will say Insert SIM Card even if it is inside
It recyles and when it does so the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phones your calls is dropped
There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics ringtones and games
Save your monies because you might end up spendings 4050 bucks on SIM cards and another 50 for a replacement phone
My wife and I got two of these phones for free when she switched to Cingular
After two weeks we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same models because it would froze and drop calls constantly
My phone was fine but has lately been experiencing the same issues
I know services is not the problems as I had a Samsung phones through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas
Sometimes Ill have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back
Even though it iswas free its not worth the frustration
I got this phones in January and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing services and dropping calls
They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone
The one I have now isnt as bad as the first one but it still loses service and drops calls constantly
I thought Motorola StarTac my very first phones was bad wait till use this phone
First it keeps complaining to insert sim card although its inserted properly
Wents to Cingular store got the new sim card works ok for a day
Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones
Now one of the two doesnts complain about the sim card but occationally it says its not in the network although it shows full bars
I just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but cant talk more than a minutes
It just drops a call in the middle of conversation
I now am trying to get a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it
I am under 2 years contract and still got 14 months to go what a nightmare
We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability no bells and whistles needed
Our major use was to communicate between each other
Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned
Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone
The major problems have included services not available even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location unable to read insert card and of courses dropped calls
Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agents trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middles of the calls
At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solutions
headset NOT COMPATIBLE with the Nokia 1100 Completely different connector types
Totally impractical this model smartphone is already fairly bulky this just makes it as lot more so
Even worse you can not attach it to your belt or pocket because there are no clips and or loops in the designs
The constructions is shoddy very bad qualities leather made in China
The USB cable and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone purchased through Xcingulars
The phone does indicate that it is charging through the cables
Uninstalled the software and tried again with firewall shut off
Connecting a USB device should NOT be this difficult
I bought this case to protects the best bars phone on the markets the Sony Ericsson W810I
Within 2 Days the cases already started to crack and chip
I dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case
The only good things is that it looks nice and stylish but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon
Bottom Line This cases only protects against scratches
I was actually looking at the Clear Silicone Cases
my car adapter lasted for about a week and then it broke and my case riped on the 2 days
Unless you have a CD with a program that is specific to your phones this cables
First The part that the ratcheting clips clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws
Third Only the case is black all other parts are clear plastic
Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each spent 35 dollars on shipping
Now i have to went thru the processes of trying to get a full refunds
However after about 3 weeks the dullers not so shiny coats that I liked on the cover started to come off
I was so disappointed I took it off and went with my original cover
It looks really bad and just looks like something Ive had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks
As you can tell from the items name this products should hasn't been compatible with my phone
However when installing the cd you are asked to picked your phone from the list
Then I got a message saying it woulrd corrupt my computer if I continued to download
Howeverwho wants to send it back for a refund when you lose shipping and the shipping was as much as the item
Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity
After it had finished installing Windows XP came up with an error messages that stated the completion of this installations could cause corruption with the operatings system
The only support I received was to send me to a competitors homepage and trying to download their software
The software provided did not works and it did not include the VX8300 models There was no contact information for the manufacturers and I spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate driver plus I had to find software to use this things
USB jack did not fit my phones and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in it works now but has to be held in by hand
Came with no instructions and if you dont have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers you wont be able to figure this out
The driver CD is useless more or less since they dont send you a product number which is needed to access the menus on the CD
It works and I am able to sending files to and from my phones but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer and a whole lots of cursing
I wont isn't ordering anything from them again and if I had it to do over Id order the cable from a different company
I was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own
but I had to located the correct drivers on my own and its definitely not intuitive and definitely not plugandplay
Support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitors website to locate the drivers on my own
Also and with no offense intended if you think a driver is a people behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you
It took a week and half to receive it 3 days to get confirmation for the orders only and they ship by regular mail
then theres a single protectives screen precuts in a plastic it doesnt cover well the whole screen surface its about 12 mm narrower and its very tough hards to put it in place without drawing dusts or leaving fingerprints underneath I had to taken it off immediately then once removed from places its a wastes
I bought this and i have no clues how to sync to my lg cu500s and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable is recommend gettting the one from lg electronics even though it is more its worth it
This cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting
It costs more to ships it back then it does to replace it
I will chalk this up to you get what you pay for
The case fit well but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart
Im very gentle with my phone but the little pieces of plastic that hold the covers on the sides started to pop off one by one
THe bottom is still on great but it dosnt doesn't me any good without a top
I ordered a threepiece sets of an earpiece phone covers and car charger for my Motorola i860 phones
When I get the order the phone cover customs supposedly was too small for my phone
My earpieces worked temporarily then it started shocking me now it doesnt work
The only piece the one I didnt need that worked was the cars charger
Net10 cell phones are great but dont buys this card
Net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards
I put the pins in my phone and did not receives the minutes
I called technical support and received 1000 minutes
I was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that I will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system can not issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days
I put the multiclips on my belt and the springs metal bent out of shape
I found another clip from another cellphone which fits but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also
This clip came with the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone
The second days that I had the cases I lightly bumped against a doorways and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasnt able to be fixed
I am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner
I would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around at a desks
I dont know if it was just my clip or if all of them are made poorly
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant see anythings in the outer window especially in the sun lights
So you cant see whos calling or what times it is without opening the phone
Its my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers
Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Excellent highres LCD but the rests of the phones was a disappointment
Poor overall interface with configurations options in nonintuitive locations
Particularly disappointings was how it handled WiFi
Each application seemed to want to be tied to a particular wireless source
So Id go home and try to get it on the wireless but Id have to bring up the app let it spins a whiles be told it couldnt connect then Id have to tell it to use the local WiFi
The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to is used as anything beyond a phone and a very expensive an bulky one at that
I can check and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to get an appications running and connected via WiFi
Much better WiFi managements is a must before Id considers this phone
This is a serious example of one device trying to do everything and doing nothing very well
The device is relatively nice but I gave it two stars because a 500 price tags means it has to deliver
I wouldnt buy this unless its an emergencies because its one of those chargers that reports errors and makes your phone start beeping nonstop when its done charging
I dont want this because I like charging at night the other chargers dont do this I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall like switching off when the battery is fully charged
so it beeps as if its being plugged in over and over
When I first got it I was trying to carefully plugs it into my phoneand I didnt want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger
It wasnt going in smoothly and it didnt match up or seem to fit inside at ALL
So I went a day without a phones and I did more research to see why the heck theyds lie that it fit my phone
Finally I got fed up because I couldnt find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it
But it was charging so I was happy my cell is my only phone
Then I tried getting it out and couldnt figures it out I had to jimmying it off and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secured itself
I was able to put it back on and finally learned a routines so to speechifying for taking it off but its cheaps
So the charger works but its very hard to use and it isnt convenients at all
This adapter was supposed to charging ww600is as listed but it did not even fit it
Its totally false information being given for this item
cant belive Amazon has these untrustworthy merchants
This charger works but apparently not quite the ways Sony Ericsson would like it to
When using this charger my SE W300i often reports charging errors
This never happened with the original SE chargers which my dog ate hences the new one
A very basic phone with not one good ringtone display or wallpaper
I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that werent working
Cant use the phones in my house or at works although my prior Nokia worked well
There are some nice things but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual
theres a composers in the phones to compose your own ringtone
First you pay for the ringtones and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it
The saving grace was the abilities to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet
I was unable to find a ringtones loud enough so that i could hear the phone when its in my purses
However putting the phone on vibrates was buried in the menus and not in the user manual
Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icons on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate
I especially hate how loud the phones is when you go to turn it off in a theaters
Youres being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise
Its only silents when you shut it down from silent ringing
Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons you get noisy tones as you lower the volume
I must live on the edge of Cingulars and everyones elses coverage areas
This phone cant hold a call at my house and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength
Part of the problem is the coverages areas but parts is the phones too
I have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem
If you live like I do in a pothole on the Information Superhighway avoid this phone
Im on my 3rd v180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to returned it under warranty for another
Unfortunately they have the option of sending you a refurbished model which means that they tried to fix someone elses problems phone and pawn it off on you
This one is going to getting flushed as soon as I find another phones to bought since Cingular says its now out of warranties and Im not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months
I had to change 4 phones in one year with cingulars
I gave this one stars because there is not an option for zero stars
Sim cards does not stores the full information on each contact and is therefore useless
Sim card failed after less than 1 month and had to be replaced
Foolish designer attached vibrators module to flat cable connecting bases piece to hinged piece
The vibrations causes the cable to delaminate and soon the vibrate doesnts work and eventually the screens fail and you have to order replacement phone
Less contact fuctionality of any of my previous phones ies
One of my 3 phones in a 8 month spans failed after a fall of 10 onto the floors
I have to disassemble the phones and clean the microphone every month or so or no one can hear me talking
The clams shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse
The cars charger works so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package
One thing my boyfriend and I learned through this experience is to payed for known quality and performance in the long run you save money hassle and times
50 as I recall plus shipping I ordered the Bargaincell Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarettes lighter adapter
I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back at a cost to me and probably received a replacement
But for the cost of the units it was not worth my time
I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesnt work with it
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK It is suppose to make it so you can transferring data from cells phones to computer I wanted to took my pictures from my phone and uploads to computers
the cables comes with a id numbers on it and you have to getting the driver off the disk that comes with it
I have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work
I dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong numbers or what the problem is
The disk has 40 files on it I dont knowing if one of the other drivers would work but I am very frustrated
I bought this battery to replaces the original ones that came with my cells phone
The new one holds a charge a shorter times than the old one does I have to charge it every day whether I use it or not
I only buy it because I must to have a battery backup for long trips and I cant wait for the seidios battery
Well the only good things one can say about the Treo 680 batteries is that its thinners
The batteries for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day
As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 45 hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable
Im really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy batteries with the Treo 680
But happily there is a quick fix buys 12 more batteries and keep them charged and dont leave home without them
Unlike the other review I can not recommend this at all
The GPS regularly takes at least 10 minutes to find satellites sometime longer the Palm needs to was resynced bluetooth with the GPS at least once a month
The first times I tried to place the 7290 in the cases it split at the seams
The battery was not accepted by my motoraola phones
Unfortunately I discovered it after the expiration of the Amazon returns date
I bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charges after sitting in a closet for a year
I was thrilled to gets a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again
I opened it up put it in my phone tried to close the battery cover and it would not close
If I forced it really hard I could get it to just closes over the latches but it was actually bending the plastics of the phone and the latch would probably be in dangers of popping off at any moment
The battery is about 50 thicker than the standard battery for a Motorola v60s
Might was great for the extra batteries lives but bad if you cant get gotten the battery cover on your phone
I give it two stars because the batteries may works fines for all I know but it wont fit in a v60s
but a belt clip is placed vertically making it obtursive and cumbersom
Although its listed under the accessories sections for the V66 it is NOT for the V66
Well I guess it will work with just the phone but not the extra batteries
No senses in having this if it doesnt charge the second batteries
I checked it out on the Motorola site and in facts it is the wrong one
This charger is the Motorola SPN5029 which doesnt work with the V66 and 2nd batteries
Before buying this phone from Amazon I called Palm and they told me that there would is a 1 year warranty on this items as long it is new
I subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and I am using it on the TMobile network
I now have a problem on the display within 2 months of purchases
I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech support they asked me to read out my serial number
It starts with a HAGA which they indicate means that it has to be on the ATT Wireless Network
According to them I am in violations of the warranty since I am using it on the TMobile network
How am I know what the serial number on the backs of the phone means prior to my purchase If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network
Palm is taking the easy way out they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon
If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions please letters me know
The price is high considering that there are newer models
This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon
com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboards stop working
When I contacted Palm they told the warranties does not cover keyboards failure then I called Tmobile who advised me to backup the data and doing a hard reset
I called back on satuday 02042006 Palm told me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or pays 25 to get a premium exchanges option and that I would getting the unit in 2 to 3 business days
I called back on the following Wednesday palms said to waiting untill Friday
Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday
I asked to be refunded my 25 because they lied on the terms the operator said that she could not
That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650
Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had
Ill spares you the details since theyve been documented well elsewhere
I will add that After my 4th phones dying on me I decided to cancel my services with Cingular which renders my locked phones a 400 paperweight
Ive gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS
Palm was a good company once now they have got their heads up their
Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now
I have to started with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years
IIts user friendliness and sheer wealths of applications and uses still keeps me excited
The devices can am not used for phone calls calendars web browsing email IM ICQ AOL etcs
internets radios stations document editing games modem for the laptops
So why only two stars and why poor executions Very poor voice call quality reported by many and totally unacceptable Luckily for me and some others one of the internet enthusiasts came up with the solutions open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil
It worked but it should never had to be necessary
When you go to install the drivers youre supposed to select your phones from the list
Well it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete and my phones wasnt on there which probably means that yours wont be either
Dont waste your time on this cable and just buy the music essentials kit that is actually made for this phones
The product arrived fine and on time from AccessoryOne
But the cables would not stay connected in the USB ports on my computer
I had to held it just right for the cables to stay connected
I threw this cable away and winds up buying Verizons Music Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600
The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver that work fine
Thanks God that the phone can survive a moderate fall
The case pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fits at the times you receive the cases its all loose after that
Another disappointment the circular knob that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clips often screws out causing again you guessed it falls
1 Superior protection I have dropped my phones twice onto concrete and there has been no damages to phone or case
2 All buttons accessible though a bit difficult to get to in cases
1 Signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case
2 Belt clip useless since the case can easily open spilling out the phones when on ones belt
3 Side ok button difficult to press same with top two front front buttons above starts and ok buttons
Usable only for protection during transportations and does this well
When I recieved this item I had mixed emotions for the product
On one hand the black finish looked very nice and the clear plastics covering protected the screen but was still easy to reads
Also all of the sides buttons are fairly easy to reach with averagesized fingers except maybe the cameras button so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard
However due to the paddings and the natures of the metal materials the case is very thick and bulkies when using the belt clip the phones sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip but leans at an angle
BUT the deciding factor in my twostar rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 which at such a steep price is not somethings I like to drop
The problem lies with the snapshut system that closes the case
Because the metal is so thin it does not secures very well and can come open pretty easily
To fix this I simply bent the piece of metal downwards and towards the phone so that it was much harder to both open and close the case
This for the most parts solves the problem but it is still dangerous and cautions is DEFINATELY in order
My favorite thing about this cases is that you can open the cases and slide the keyboards open without actually taking the phones out of the cases
This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages
This is the only reason I did not give it a onestars rating
I am currently looking for a soft cases preferably a leathers sleeves case that I can just pull my phones out of off of my hip rather than bother with a clip anymore
As a final warning BE CAREFUL if you buy this case
Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
You have to opens it to slid out the full keyboard making it vulnerable to damage
It doesnt matter whether you open the cases or not
If it drops the case falls right open anyway spilling your device on to whatever hard surfaces you were trying to protect the 8525 from
The case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weights of the devices and sticks out too far when you wear it
The case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something and dropping everything on to the grounds to be damaged at least thats what happened to me
Super disappointed in this product in cases you couldnt tell
My complaint about the belt clips it is made of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild uses
Please please dont buying this just by seeing the photos
It looks nice and great but practically this is a pieces of junk
it makes buttons more deep down there by making inaccessible
The stylus grove is not good there by making stylus to project out and it will slip
It opened and my fone hit the ground thrice and i cingular doesnt insure this instrument
It can not sustaining the weight of the total phones with the case
Once i hook up this fone to the belt i dont want that my fones would twist and turning
and the worst of allwhen the flip faces downwardswhich happens by twists and turnsthes flip opens and cell fones hits grounds wowowwww such a nice designs to a piece of junks and hats off to the lousy designers and I hate my self for buying this
The phones fits nicely but that latch is NOT secure
With in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hits the tile floor at a customers houses
Tons of fun watching your 500 PDA hit the ground and the battery come flying out
Phones is ok but the cases is getting replaced ASAP
Originally I purchased this heavyduty case to protect my new expensive 8525
However wearing the case on my belt with the belt clips my phone fell out of the cases several times when the case cover accidentally opened up
Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged but I have several big dents and scratches on the case
Im going to stop using a case now since the phone is now already beatup
The latch mechanisms for the cover will loosen up with uses especially since youll have to opening and close it repeatedly to access the touches screen
Also it took a bit getting used to to have to open the case to make a phone calls
The overall qualities of this case is very good thoes because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons
I guess its a great case if you dont wear it on your belts
But I cant justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket
I dropped my Treo enough times to break it and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case
I have a LG VX5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with was a no goes
Product would not install from enclosed CD computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosed USD cord
I have since ordered received and installed from another product Data Point from another vendors
Maybe its because this product is not approved for windows but I couldnt get it to install
Yes the cables fits but the CDs driver is just for the 8300
The covers doesnt fit snug with the phone the stitching broke after two weeks and the release button is triggered from the bottom
Today it fell off in a parkings lots when i realized my phone was missing is retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car
This is a poor quality product and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone
Ive had a silicone cases on my Treo 650 for a long time
It was thin and the rubber was very grippy great antislip once I left my Treo on tops of my cars NOT recommended and drove 10 miles and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it
The rubbers on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original cases so much so that its difficult to use the 5way navigators without it doing what I didnt want it to did
The cases is not nearly as grippy and slides off my cars seat unlike the original
Boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive since this isnt I probably wont bother
But in my opinion theres better products out there
These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia
With that being said the qualities control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped
The software being aftermarket too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone
Despite what the descriptions say this software and cables are not compatable with Mac at this time
I ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830s has such a small battery life
After about 12 months of use the thing shorted out and wouldnt work any more
I decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured Id give it another chance
the things didnt even work out of the boxes this times
spend the money on a Motorola brand charger instead
When I started charging my K750i it didnt charge at all no matter what
I bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a this model is listed in the descriptions
First off the CDs that comes with the data cable does not have my phone models on it making it useless
I figured this would be no problems because the software for my phones is available from Sony Ericssons websites
After downloading the software and following the instructions to a TEE I was still unable to link up my computer with my phone
I even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in cases I made an error
All told this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with Amazon
However the generic LG driver software that comes with the USB cables to transfer music from computer to phones doesnt have an authenticities signatures
I dont know about other computers but mine with Windows XP SP2 wont accept it
Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that Motorolas hardware was very good but that their software left a lots to be desired
Nonetheless I decided to try this phones out when it came times to start a new cells plan
I had made the decision to switch to Tmobile and this looked like one of the best phones options
Right off the bats I found out that the people who criticized Motos software were right on the money
There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone not the least of which is the frankly idiotic way the phones book is designed
Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone
As time went by I started noticing that I was missing a lots of calls
The phone would be in my bags or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a messages that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before
During the course of the last few months the phone is less than a year old Ive also found that it has begun crashing
Opening or closings it will result in a white screens of death
Putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging that it is unable to charge and that its SIM card can not be found after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off
With a full battery charges it will continually shutter itself off
At this point I am forced to conclude that this phones is an absolute piece of junk
I am also forced to conclude that it isnt the only model which is
None of my coworkers has ever had a good experiences with a Motorola phones
My wife Motorola has shown its own host of problems
People working for Tmobile at several stores I have visited have confided that they never ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone
In fact Ive had Tmobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them but rather to shopped for an unlocked Nokia onlines
Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every nights restart it five or six times a days and keep apologizing to my friends families and employers for always missing their calls
The sound is low staticky and it frequently dropped calls
I was sold on the AAA battery power source because the rechargeable ones wont last on a 14 hour works shift and even then I have no 120V outlets to recharge
However I have to say the audio output when adjusted to max volumes is barely audible in an 18 wheeler at highways speeds
The winds and engines noises is much higher than in a cars and similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft
The advertisements criminally overstate the talks and standby times as well
With a regular new Duracell AAA batteries I get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby
And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable battery I get only 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone
As for the marketing department at Motorolla I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior products that lacks stated function and durability
I hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people
Hint Get a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecing society
After 18 months of services my original battery was nearing the end of its lives
Instead of updating to a newer phones accompanied by a new 2year service agreement I opted to purchase a new battery
Wastes of money The new battery offers approximately one day of standbies powers which means I must recharge nightly
That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery nightly recharge
This batteries was no better then the old battery it replaced
Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use
The headphone has a standard 8mm plug and wont work with the Katana
The software that comes with this is not the right software for the VX8500
Havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it
its not showing my phone on any of the software programs after i hook it up using the USB cable
the nokia bl4c battery i got is a counterfeit with fake number 0406040703000042032
It did not fitting my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can
I had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit
When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clips
I would no recommend this product to anyones even if it does cost a dollar
You will still needing to buys the AC cord for this unit
and is still havent been able to figure out how to use it
i had other phones in the pasts and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use
THis products seems to be a lot harder unless its the wrong data cables which it shouldnt be since its advertised as an EnV data cable
The first problem I encountered with this came right after I took it out of the box
Both connectors were covered by labels which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pull them off
I spent about an hour just trying to get them clean enough to use
Second problem came when I popped in the software disc
It turned out to be nothings more than a readmes files linking me to drivers that didnt even work
I spent another 2030 minutes searching the nets for drivers that worked
The cable itself worked fine after I managed to clean the connectors off find the appropriate drivers and downloads Windows Media Player
Be aware if you have a Chocolate with V5 firmwares you wont be able to use programs like BitPim with this cables
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON ALL CORNERS
I received this items and the blues illuminated caps is not present on this items
There is a less expensive product in the marketplace w a mere blue LED that looks similar and that product costs about 10 less Best Buy
While certainly this product works satisfactorily and the prices is decent you should realize that what youre going to gets is not what is pictured
Bought a cell phone batteries from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a cell phone battery last longer than a month They refuse to refund or replace
They are a shady company and Ill never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same
Ive had car chargers before for other cell phones and never experienced any problems
I was attracted to this one by the low cost but I guess you get what you pay for
It lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether
The chargers I got did not fitted the Motorola V188 wrong connecter
This product is not what its cracked up be if looking for a screens protector look elsewhere
I can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen looks bad
Waste of 10 and customer services wont respond to my email matter of fact email to customer service didnt ever delivered
Bought a cells phone battery that of courses died one week past their returnrefund deadlines
Refused to refund or replaced even though the product is CLEARLY defective
This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again
This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surfaces of the screen
I attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughly between each attempts cleaning the Cingular screen with a new lens cloth
Once specks of dust touch the adhesive theyre there for good and the protectors is ruined
I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the devices screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was of the scratches the protectors was meant to avoid Save your money and just buys a good case to put your 8525 in
I have had to exchanging my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times Luckily I purchased the insurances
Im going back tomorrow for my 4th phones in 1 yrs this last phone only lasted a few weeks
The phone works fine then all of sudden one day 12 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phones open the is on the screen and you cant got to anything
No phones numbers no voicemail no text messages nothings It is extremely frustrating
What is the point of a cutes phone that doesnt works
is moved to miami and can not get receptions anywhere
it cuts me off the minutes is enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk
i had to getting a lands lines for the first times in over 5 years because is can not use it in my apartments so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates
but heres the things other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem they actually gets a couple bars of receptions whereas i always have one or none at all
i returned the phones and all they could does was give me another just like it
i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month
i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price
on top of that people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous
unless you never talk on it the batteries wears out in a hurry
and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking
is usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accidents
i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils
chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one or wasting money on a land line
whatever you do dont getting suckered in by its cute pink color because underneath its pretty exterior its junks
I got it because I needed a new phone it was only 40 bucks and its pink
Yesterday after charging the phone the ENTIRE night took it off the chargers about 8am for work
I made a 5 minutes phone call a 6 minute phone call entered a numbers into my contacts entered an events into my calendars received a text message and made a 3 minute phone calls and the phone started bleeping low battery
Remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago Thats what is here
The dates and time dont continuously display on the outside screen
I dont have a clocks in my office I have a very small office and works for a nonprofit and I dont wear a watches Im constantly opening my phone to see the times its ridiculous
I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am able to speak to them before the battery goes dead
If you want a cutesies phone and you speak for less than 10 minutes a day this is a great phone
After my Nextel phone started acting up I decided to switched services because I liked the Razr styles and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the In calling was a bonuss
I have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860s
You can import only a couple of MP3s before the phones memory is full unless you buy their 50 transflash card 1 gig is the largest
Then you can not assigning the MP3s you import as ringtones either a major disappointments for me again missing my i860 with its 400 ringtones that I imported from random WAV midi and MP3 files
You can not change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events you have to set a reminders for all there is no option for no reminder
All in all not what I grew accustomed to with my i860
Im already thinking the 175 early term charges is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the lives of my 2year contract
And that leads me to another ripoff with Verizon they charge you an extra 35 to sign only a oneyear term Next time Ill read the fine print and just upgrade my Nextel
well im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon accounts and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wirelesses is loved it especially because its pinks but now that ives had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it
first off it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen and that takes forever the phones in general is slow
Im stuck with this phone for a while and am not to happy with it
I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and colors which are the ONLY positive features
The viewing screen is so small that I cant even reading the time and it does not give the option to use larger fonts sizes
The battery dies about three hours after being charged even if I havent used the phone
It does not give me the abilities to automatically call back someone who left a messages unless that person also has Verizon service
I am forced to enter a code in orders to hear my messages and I cant found any ways changes this
Holds the phones well for a few months untils the clips on the sides loosen and break
After that happens the phones falls out pretty easily
and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a magnetic clasp
This is a very basic holster and often simple is best but not this time
The good news the 8700 slips right in and out with eases the swivel works great and the clip is reasonably secure
A minor issue becuase its plastic when the virbrates ring is active it makes an annoying rattle sound
The real problems is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs one on each side
Everyday use must weaken the plastic becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my cases which meant that they 8700 would not stay puts
It slipped out and fell to the floor several times
I replaced the case and a month later the tabs on the new case broke too
Due to cheap build quality Id suggest you look at thirdparty cases options instead of this ones
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to pressurized the enter key but it was covered by the plastic
The reasons I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answers a call
I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better
I have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months
It used to weren't only 6 each so it didnt matter too much Nextel sells theirs for usually 1520
But if you are looking for a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replaced them feel free to buys this items
Now that they have raised the prices to 10 Ill probably not buys this anymore and get the better one at Nextel
I mean really how old is your phones Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired
The Liion batteries usually last around 18 months hence at 18mon a bunch of ipod users are gon na get pissy when the ipod doesnt work anymore and you cant change the battery
you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 hr on standby at first and then drop down to 4 hr on standbies
Why have you noticed yet how hot that phone is running it is cooking its internal electronics your ear and the battery
when you get a new phones the new one will only have a 90day warranty
you will spend at least an hour with them on the phone
Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users this belts clip does not fit the phone
The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holsters are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the tops of the phone to snap into the locks groove
This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola phone but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530
that was great plugs it in it didnt fit so wigle it in
i tryed again this time i grip the base tightly the base split in two
one more time this times the coper piece got smashed
I ordered a PC cases that came in a box 1000 times larger then what this was shipped in for 10 dollars shippings but I ordered 5 of these for myself and co workers and shipping was 22 dollars
I purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone
My old batteries would not hold a charge anymore so I wanted a new one
I dont think its a problem with this vendors but a problem with the manufacturer instead
Would not recommend ordering this if youre looking to replaces an old one
I ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarettes lighters splitters
I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind not at all like the ones shown
The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pay to send them back
I never got an emails about the substituation or response to my calls or email to the company
the other reviewers couldnt run much power through his splitter but thought it might be ok for cells phone chargers etc
I wanted a splitters for my radar detectors and my cell phone charger so I thought great
The little light goes on but the radar detector doesnt go and the cells phone charger doesnt go
Ill probably take it apart andd see if I can rewire it
I really cant recommends buying one of these things from this manufacturer
Theres nothing quotuniversalquot about this product
Itll split lightweight stuff like cell phones but dont trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter
I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second
Sadly Id bought four of these since shipping costs as much as the item itself and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop
The back of the package says not to use items that use over a totals of 10amps which seemed reasonable so I got out my ammeters and figured out that my laptops used 6amps at most so not only is this busted but they lie on the package
I managed to opening up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastics melting it turns out even one of the springs inside couldnt handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it
I give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cells phones simultaneously
I have had three of these during my two years contracts I am trying to baby the last one enough until the ends of the two years
Each has had the problem of powering down and rebooting without warning
The are billed as Milspec this or that but unless you keep it inside a purse get ready for many trips to the Sprint store
Motorola used to be THE name in communications but after this and my friends problems with the Razrs Im headed to Nokia
My office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract
No people in our offices has ever commented on how much they like this phones or its performance
Battery life is terrible out of the box the interface is clunky and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance
If everythings else in your lives is perfect then this phones is for you it will give you SOMETHING to complain about
For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to works with your NextelSprint network contracts
I have had nothing but problems with these phones
Each time I went to repair it I had to be on a waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this models
I would got it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later
Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging
They will not admit these phones are pieces of crap
When I call I wait for an eternity througha million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to aren't transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them
The 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired
If this one goes Im canceling my Nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier
Ive had it Nextel and Motorola cant figure out that this phone is JUNK
My problems with nextels did not stop when I canceled my service
When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired I of course wanted to keep my numbers
So as I went to got my Cingular phone highly recommended I had the old number switched to my new numbers
Today I get in the mail my nextel statement for the months with a 200 early terminations even though I had not canceled my services but had simply got a new phones and switched my number over
This was on icing on the cakes after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel
In my towns not a small town by any means there are very few places that have any service
In the largest subdivision you can not get service anywhere
I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line
Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located
Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls calls would go straight to my voice mail
Not only would I not get the calls but often I would not even get the voices mails until days or even weeks later
When I did actually take calls and call out I can not counted the numbers of times Ive had my call dropped
I recieved so many different errors messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their times at nextel thinkings of different errors messages to program into their phones
That brings me to the sellings point of nextel the famed and wellloved direct connect feature
Direct connects only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it
Even then in the middles of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beeps of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore
Of course I would expect nothing less from the nextel network
If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message it took days or maybe didnt even come at all
The internets access was fine it the rare instance that it worked
Of course when you dont have services you dont gotten the internet access either
I was constantly getting the message network not available
Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile
Trying to got through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothings
My experience with nextel has been nothings short of a disasters and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel
Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the ends
My wife and I both got this phones at the same time
I chose it because it claims to is rugged and the price was right
Well we have had them for around six months and they are both not working right
My wife took hers to one of those stores in the malls that can change the case so her i560 now wears pinks
Shortly after it started resetting itself randomly
She would picked it up just to found that she needed to entrance the SIM password
At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change but later my phone started doing the same thing
Now my phone will resetting itself at least four or five times a days
I absolutely can not believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect
Anybody can ship one bad product but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable
I purchased 2 i560 phones one for me and one for my husband
Brand new out of the box 1 of them had a bad microphone you could hears the people talking but they couldnt hear you
Nextel Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days but I raised a stink and finally got it replaced since it was broke from days 1 I didnt want a serviced phone
Here we are 3 months later 1 of the phones has a bad microphone AGAIN and the other phones keypad just went bad
We dont mistreat these phones at all in fact we hardly ever use them
Motorolla Nextels warranty is also worthless we have to pay to ship our phones to Motorolla and we dont get them back for 15 days
I am stuck with a 2 year contract with Nextel the services has been horrible and the i560 phones are lemons junk I would NEVER bought a i560 phone again or use NEXTEL their service is terrible
And yes many times the people on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking aka drunks
I bought this phone at the same times I bought the i870s
Ive dropped my i870 a couple of times and its fine
My husband dropped the rugged phone once and the antenna which sticks out like a thumb snapped off
Nextel does not warranting the phone unless you have their insurances plan regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards
What army DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE unless of course you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months
Purchased this phone as an upgrades from the i530s which I loved
I was at the end of a 2 year contracts and felt that I would getting something with a few more bells and whistles and was excited about the colors screen with the icons
Two of my families members have higher end Nextels and all work well
I would have purchased one of those except I didnt really care about a camera for my phone and this one was reasonably priced
and I found out you get what you pay for The i560s felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750 i870 and even my old i530s
I had it for a couples of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarities of my calls I could hear them but they couldnt heard me
A couples of times I had the screen go to Airplane Mode even when I hadnt touched it
The facts that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside too
My previous phones had to be flipped open to see who was calling but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it
When charging the phones it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight and to check that is says device attached it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly
Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speakers just stops working
Living in California apparently gives us an advantages 30 day risk free guarantee
Fortunately we were on days 12 and after 54 minutes one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order
Hoping the new one on its way works much better
I got this phone as part of a buyoneget one free promotions
I changed from Cingular because I couldnt stand my bills being constantly wrong
Within the first two months my phone already malfunctioned
While talking to my wife on the phones the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screens
Next all I could hear was the sounds of someone holding down a phones key
The phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the commands to turn off
Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phone the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode
This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether
My wife phones had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone
Mine is currently on its ways to Motorola to be repaired
I was seconds away from ordering this chargers for my Mothers V170
THANKS for the reviews you have saved me time money frustration for letting me know it wont works
I would have thought that amazon would have fix the problems that it did not fit v170
I bought my wife a brandnew v170 for her birthday
She wanted an extra charger to take to work so I bought this one
Big mistake It simply would not fit in the charger jacks
Last night when my wives was cleaning the counters she threw it in the trashes brandnews box and all
99 it wasnt even worth the troubles to try to return it
I saw the other reviews that said it didnt work for V173 but I bought this anyway for my V170s
Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me
The jack doesnts fit in the holes of the phone on the Motorola V173
First the pros clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screen protecting them from wear
Fit is tight so the case takes up little additional space in my pocket
Now cons dirts and debris easily finds its ways between the plastic and the phone
this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone
When I tried to remove the phone for cleaning the side of the cases ripped
All in all I would not has bought this product again
I wanted to give it only one stars but maybe its a little better than the original
It still goes down by the ends of the day and I dont like the bulge
My equipment is a Nokia 6225 I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional SP4 and Windows XP Pro and both dont works
They dont know the devices and with the PC Suite of Nokia it is not connected either
I assumed that I would get a DKU5 which is supposed to work according to the Nokia sites
However I got a DKU2 which does indeed connects to my phones 6016i but is recognized by neither Win XP nor Linux
The part numbers should have been properly displayed somewhere
The packaging indicates that it is in facts Nokia part
If you are buying this to connect to a Nokia phone beware
It is a nonNokia part and will no easily interfaces with the Nokia software
It uses a different chipset than the Nokia data interface cables which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers
You may being able to gotten it working but I have spent about four hours and have not met with success
I even installed the PL2303 serial driver but I could not makes it work
If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial ports so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed
Youll saves yourself some head aches and heart aches
The cords does connect to my phone but the computer does not register the phone
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect
To me the words charge all at once means that I can charges all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the walls
This item is simply a method for organizing you devices
Although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34
99 I paid and if it wasnt a gift and Christmas wasnt 3
I feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650 and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680
I have been a faithful customers of Palm technology since 1997 and for the first time I am disappointed
Of course I still have the friendly Palm OS tailors made for smart phones
I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15000 records stored in the Treos four main applications
But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations and its clumsy commands bar results in unexpected commands contrary to the 650 buttons are too close to each other
Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired especially compared with the 650 after firmware update
Finally I use Intellisync for dual sync with both userfriendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty emails MS Outlook the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo Intellisync new version added a records number in the note fields of all my records I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with MS Office 2007 compatibilities
Nokias low blow to Palm It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solutions of their own
The good news is they fixed a lots of the things about the Treo 650s interface that were clunky and it seems to crash less but the batteries lives is significantly less than the 650 in my experience so much so that I wish I had never upgraded to the 680
I upgraded to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speakers and audio problems dont all Treo 650s suffer from that within a years usage and was already replaced once with a refurbished ones that developed same problems
I loved my Treo 650 anyway so I expected something equivalent to the 650 but what I got was a smartphones with quite a stupid battery life
I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in designs some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM cards that is causing power to run right out of the phones in a sharp decline even when its not in uses and all possible extraneous functions are disabled
Add to this the fact that Palms websites online users group is not active right now so no users can visibly discuss this among themselvesand you dont have to think too long to concludes that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward when they recently dumped this cheaper smartphone on the markets recently
Palm all I can saying is pretty stupid and wonder if this was your last hurrahs before exiting the smartphone market
When my Treo 270 died I bought a used 270 on Ebay
Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon
I called Palm tech supports on issues I had with it dial up networking didnt work on internal browsers with TMobile
Forgive me for saying it but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be
I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate things after another he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time did he think I was lying to him
He knew nothing about the phones and kept deferring to a supervisor constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge wastes of time
After a few calls like this with no resolutions I gave up and decided to return the 650
I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try
For me it was a huge mistake Pocket PCs is a joke and completely unintuitive
They expect you to study how to use their OS in orders to make uses of its clumsy interface
Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use but cmon when you buy a phones you expect it to work right from the beginning I dont want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly
Finally I give up on Pocket PC sold it on Ebay and give Palm another tries when I see the 680 come out
The dialup networking issues is no longer a problem on the 680 as compared to the 650 and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm
Overall its a decent phones and I just feel ways more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PCs
Palm customers supports is still useless and as others have mentioned the lacks of a standard MiniUSB connector is simply inexcusable
Still Im much happier with PalmOS over Pocket PC
As I use it I see that the battery doesnt seem to last very long just over 2 hours of talktime at the most
I hesitantly call Palm support and get some flunkie again I decide to cut my losses and stopper wasting my time with their supports
Im just going to buy a second battery and second chargers to keep the phone charged
I hate the idea of making such a compromise but for me its the lesser of two evils
The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery lives is indicative of their customer mindsets
As clunky as my Windows MDA was its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me even though the MDA has a much bigger screen
IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product lines but the customer oriented mentalities of Handspring went right out the window along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo
Most of the better designed smartphones on the market Samsung Motorola HTC Wizard are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used its clouts to take over the market
I just wish other manufacturers offered PalmOS based smartphones again this way youd get the intuitive interface of Palm without having to be limited to Palms poorly designed hardware
maybe its time I finally give the Blackberry a try
I love the way the phone looks and feels but thats about it
From finding contacts to dropped calling this phone functions well below any phone Ive ever owned
Ive had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rises
First let me say that I really wanted to like this device
I had patience and understanding for a whiles but it got me nowhere
The main issue with this phones is its operating system Windows Mobile 5
Simple things that should take a clicks or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just gives up
Connectivity with TMobile is horrible accessing the aim function doesnt work 9 times out of 10
I tried finding a solution for hours and the best I got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that
Internet explorer can NEVER found the page that Im looking for and consistently tells me to tried again
Let me tell you also that this device does not let you choosing between wifi and edges
If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE then it will continue to use EDGE unless you restart the phones with wifi enabled
Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smash the phone on a daily basis
Usually I would press talk to dial a call and it would immediately say Call Ended
Also when answering a calls well trying to answer a calls it would drop it as soon as I pressed talks
What the HELL is THAT What good is a phone if you cant makes or receive calls Keep in mind this happens around half the time
Also kept in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY My calls should not be dropping except for when Im in the subway
The side volumes buttons is extremely annoying causing the volumes to go to both extremes within one conversation
Not only that but when you disable it you have no other method of changing the volumes on the device
While the keyboard is basically easy to typing on the phone is buggy
First off the t9s sucks It will completely changing the word you are typing to a words thats in its dictionaries while youre typing EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING Now get this you cant even permanently keep the t9s off
So you have to keep going into the menus to change it to normal ABC mode
While I appreciate the abilities to have faster typing isnt the whole points of a QWERTY being able to type without using t9 When you actually get to typing sometimes the keys will stick and a characters will continuously repeat until you stop it
This isnt a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue
For all you techno oriented people out there basically everyone buying this phone the programs this device has available for download are minuscules
Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a JAVA programs which most programs are coded in the Dashs JAVA program will not allow you to opens those programs
I ALWAYS got an error stating A Java midlet is not responding It then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the apps
I could go on and on about its issues but I really dont care to
While Tmobile customer support is very helpful and friendly their servicecoverage is nonexistent
Calls are constantly dropped I get voice mails without the phones even ringing and internet connectivity is never really available
Please didn't yourself a favor and waits for the iPhone
In summary Microsofts software and TMobiles service have ruined a brilliant designs although with a couples of flaws from HTC
There are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to
I will break it down to Hardware Software and Cell Phone Service Provider
A lots has been written about this aspect of the devices so Ill keeps this to a minimum The best forms factor Ive ever seen
This devices provides you the powers of a Blackberry without the bulky hardwares so I can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster
A key sellings points for me was the combined Bluetooth WiFi and quadband connectivities that enabled me to connect a wireless headsets cruises web pages and have accesses to email when in the US or Europe
The keyboard layouts is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails
The battery life is great when WiFi is not enabled and adequate when it is
Standby power management appears to be excellent
The display while a little small is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size
The camera is pretty good and its been really great emailing photos to people as Im traveling around
After all of the cons that youll read below youll wonder why I ever bought the device and why I still use it
TMobile locked me into a 2 years contract on a very expensive device
It has great hardware that I can use in the US and Europe Im just hoping that Microsoft will finally get it right
The touch sensitive volume button is the most illconceived feature Ive ever seen
Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level
Even worse when using the phones your ear or finger can inadvertently hits the controls and randomly change the volume
The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the devices
However the blames could well be laid at Microsofts doors for writing inefficient codes and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications
Either ways performance is very slow for some basic functions see below and Im afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor
When a calls is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to selects which call to take and which call to put on holds or dropignore
On the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is droppedkept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed
When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped
If the user presses anything other than the answer key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I have depressed the answers key
The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can am not used
Even worse upon selection the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open
Now I have what some would call a large database of contacts but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use models this excuse does not wash
The user interfaces for entering a new contacts is rudimentary as are all dialog windows on this device
One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock
The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness
The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degrees of sophistication but with a more intuitive use models and was more thoroughly debugged
First of all the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off
From the interface you would assuming you could only set a single alarms
The best way to explained this buggy pieces of software is with an example I set the alarm for 6am the next days the alarm goes off at 6am
That day I set the alarms for 7am the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am
The next days I set the alarms for 730am and you guessed it the alarm now goes off three times
The best that Ive been able to deduce of course this types of behaviors is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device is that the user has to actively select off for the current settings before setting on for the new time
But there is no indication of what alarms are set so after a while or a particularly busy weeks you can loose track of whats set and what isnt
the only way to clearing all of the alarms that have been set is a hard reboot
If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should aren't fired
A calculator watches in the 80s had more sophisticated features
The user interface is so bad its hard to describe it in words
Microsoft truly does not understand how a user would likes to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that theyve inflicted upon us since Windows 95
Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menus button
Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections
Some features are simply hard to find but should it really take so many menu selections to finding common tools or applications
The uses of alarms or reminders is ambiguous to putting the device in Silent mode but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up for examples does not worked
Calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notifications properties
The only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events
So on my Nokia phones a thousand years ago when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I needed once landed
The phones would then automatically connect to the provider available
It wasnt completely automatic but the user interaction was simple and intuitive
First of all TMobile doesnt help by keeping a radio button on your onlines accounts that you have to select to enabling international roaming
The features is free so why not add a selection anyway All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone wont connects to the local network no matters what you do
Now assuming that you worked this out you are now faced with the challenges of actually connecting to the local providers networks
On my Blackberry this was automatic but of course with Microsoft there are selections to make searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the providers of choice
ActiveSync This is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work
Worse still when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next times you perform synchronizations
It does not provide you with a fix a hint or a path so that you dont lose data
It does not even tell you the data that was lost
So Im using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook and they cant get that right OK it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft but come on
This was another primary purchasing driver for me
I am very busy and want to hasn't my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA all the times
I thought that with the same provider of all the software Id be OK
Also as this feature has been around for over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry
There are probably annoying nits that I have with the software but those are the major ones
TMobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe
They have much better coverage over there than in the US where Im actually paying
Im in San Francisco and I have dead spots in my house
Their backend connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy
At random times you will gotten cryptic messages saying that you must have somethings wrong with your connection and emails cant aren't accessed
But you know theres nothing wrong with your connection because youve been on the browser
Also there was a whole days that emails were not accessible
Because of the many issues that Id had with email set up and maintaining a connections I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed
When I finally called technical support they told me that their service was down no apology no notifications no nothings
Certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience
So why didnt I call technical supports earlier read below
I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their help line
Im not going to go into details as it would just take too long
Bottom line if you have a problems with your phones say Dash at the prompt and then ask for Tier Three Data support
Everything you get before that is a wastes of your time as the technicians youll encounters have inadequate trainings
If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial DO NOT DO IT This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device
So should you buy it Wait until Windows Mobile 6
Maybe another provider will picked up the device by that times
After spending 30 minutes on the phones during which time tmobiles continually wanted to blaming me did you put it in fluorescent light did you put it in the sun did you drop it did you put it in your pocket and bend it did you put it in your pocket and bump into something did you drop it did you break it did you do something bad to it they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phones was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of monies
The most amusing parts of the conversation went like this would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost 15 When I responded that the ground would were fine she said OK that will be 9
Due the lower price of the charges I decide to buy it but it doesnt works on my Sony Ericson w300i at all bad inversio
ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN100 METROS DE ALCANCE Y SOLO PALABRAS NO SIRVE NO LA DEBUELVO PORQUE ME SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO DE LO QUE CUESTA ESTA PORQUERI
The external antenna is a plastic decorations only and does not does anything functional
Poor construction software that is difficult to install unable to run when installed and requires you to purchase a licenses to get a working copy
I encourage many to stay away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra monies on a better usb dongle
As soon as i got this thing out of its packages i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction
The main problem that is have experienced with this products is that although its ranges is oknot the 100 meters that it claims as soon as is go into a room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes
This item was an absolute wastes of money and Im all the more irritated for having purchased it
Upon attempting to merely insert the device the outer case of the dongle split open
What I discovered That cute little antenna doesnt actually connect to anything Its just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side
When I finally managed to get the damn thing running the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pairconnects a devices it worked fine once
I turned off my laptop removed the dongle and was amazed to discovering that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all
Shell out the extra 152030 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2
I am not using this bluetooth dongles because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up
Instead I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plugandplay
The product works but the software that claims to be windows compatible says it is not when installing
They send it with another door for the backside because your current door wonts fits over this huge battery
It is frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry and Amazon would foist this products on us
The batteries is so big that the devices will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holster
Every times you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card
The KRZR is a really cool looking phone but it has 2 huge issues a very short battery lives 1 day and sllloooowwww reaction time push the menus key and WAIT for it to come up
After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone I purchased
Here are the main issues I have found with this phone 1 The buttons are too small particularly the main control button
You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time
2 If you have quite a few contacts in your phone you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact
You will notified that if you are not careful you will dials the wrong contact due to the delays when scrolling and selecting quickly so if this is you being aware
3 You must open the cover and looks inside to see if you have missed a calls or have a messages
VERY INCONVENIENT There is no indication to show this on the top screens only the inside screens
4 On occasions the displays on the outside of the phones stops working entirely
What you just need to doing is power the phone down and they back up again
Not optimal and I probably just got a bad phones but I am just waiting for the situations to get more frequent so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to got a replacements phones from Motorola
NOTE I have no personal vendettas against Motorola but wanted to provide some real feedbacks rather than all just rosey stuffs I bought into before purchasing
Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you cant assign specifice ring tones to phone number
text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small
The back panel display is too small and hard to read
I have the camera the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard
The reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dorks walking around in public
It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fines with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktops using the Logitech Bluetooh hub
Dont you find that strange Aside from that it also did not works with my sony ericsson phones cant remembers the model
This headsets has a major flaws the connections between the headset and phone are full of static
The other parties dont hear it but their voice is constantly zapped by the static and Im asking them to repeat themselves
Ive compared it with a couples other headsets Ive got and they dont have this problems in the same locations
Actually this headsets has static problems ANYWHERE office cars out walking you name it
Ive used the headset for a little over a years and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the sounds quality
Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance
Recently the plastics ears clips broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed thatsince it was over the one year warranty my only options would be to purchased a new headsets a huge price to pay for a pieces that costs pennies
Logitechs concerns for its customers appears to be nonexistant
I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clips that goes behind your ear broke Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller
I agree with others that after 3045 minutes it feels like your ear is in a vise
People say they can hear me just fine and I can hear them just fine
But it also disconnects with my cell phones when it is not in use
What good is that Then when the phone rings I dont hear it
This headsets is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fitted just fine
You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you
I drive truck and have a lot of backgrounds noise and windows are usually down partially and everyones has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also
The volumes is great and at times I have to turned it down in volume
Have tried the AnycomHS890 and this outperforms it hands down
Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time
I would definitely reccommend this headsets to anyone in a noisy environments
Tried to changes the rating and seems like cant do that once the review is written
then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second
When this happens youre perfectly operating earpieces becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery
While its perfmance was good before the break the use of heap plastic under the rubberized pieces instead of a small piece of memory titanums or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste batteries contains lithium I bet Skip by this one if youre smart
I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone Unlockeda month ago
I was hoping to getting the color that I saw on the web page
The phone that I received was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon webs sites
The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauves and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised
At nightin the lightings at nights the top part of the phonethe part that flips open and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray
Needless to say I spoke to customers services and sent the phone back for an exchanges
The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again so for the 2nd times I returned it and got my money refunded
I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided but again they could not help me
If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand and the color which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the webs page
Incidentally this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it pink but Amazon calls it mauvethough the phone and the image shown do not match
So stay away from ordering this pretty mauves phone
all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted
I have never met anybody that has earholes big enough for these I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ear That didnt work so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound talk sitting in the seats next to me
I dont know about you folks but I have small ears
Though the sound on these ear buds are good I cant keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a times because theyre too big for me and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears
Unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords
This product stopped working after about a week or two
lesson learned buy OEM products instead of cheap knockoffs
I purchased this headset on 1232007 and received it on 1252007
However the RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1252007
When it works the next days it can not locate the offer number nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture
If you click on the URL link supplied by Amazon Rebate form you will be able to find the offers by Amazon order number however they will disconnect you in the next step saying session expired
Its a shame for Amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers
I bought this for my new Samsung sliders phone which I love but this case is to snug for it
The slider phone is a bits larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out
Its a cute case I would love to use if it was just a little larger
I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it
I bought this items at the end of January and received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to order another colors and see if it does the same
They have the M610 listed so I took a chances but it will not charge the phones
00 50 of the sprint prices however Sprint is out of stock right now
I am sure it is a great cables but it does not works for Apple computers
Samsung does not has a driver that supports the cable and a mac
The company I ordered the cable from is great easy to work with but once again it does not work on a mac
I have repeated that it does not works on a mac multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt works with a macs
It did not fit my phones and I was forced to going out and but another one
I bought these adaptors to use regular head phones 3mm with my cell phones mp3 LG cu500 player
Once you plug the 3mm headsets into this adaptor you loose stereo sound
It makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to musics on your cell phone
I have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the bases level
They all have some type of flaw the volume wont get loud enough cord to shorting poor sounds etcs
The other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality
If you push the headphone jackmale all the way in to the adapters sound is cutoff on one speaker
You have to play with it and find the sweet spots where sound comes from both speakers
I would return this products if i thought it was worth my times and effort
5 mm jack is slightly too small creating a loose connections that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active
I tried both adapters i bought the 2pack in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose
The adapter did not work when plugged in to a samsung m500s
The sounds only came out of one ear when plugged in
The colors of the product I received is nothing like the picture If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you
I bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges
Doh This crappy cases broke within 3 weeks of use
I only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did
The little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time
Do not buy this POS unless you want to throw your monies out
Also notice that this is not a Samsung OEM parts
If you call to ask for tech support from Samsung they will tell you they cant help you
The only positive things I have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless
I go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it
You had to having the product license numbers which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copies
my advvice to you is not to bought this product but if you want to chances it you may be lucky
Cool Concept and everything but when I tried to instals the driver my CDRom drive wouldnts even pick up that little CD
Bought this because Logitech has a great reputation with other products
I used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough
I actually went back to a Jabra wired units until recently when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable has good batteries life and the sound is better
One never keeps its charges pretty much from the times I bought it
the ear pieces is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime
The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzings sound and ask me to switch to a wired mics
Also its big and heavy compared to the motorola I own
Good sound nd price nicely connect with mobile however NOT WORK at all with my PC neither MAC
Once its connected with my moble they refuse to get in touches with any PCs
they dont connect with 2 diveces in same times its OK but even if turn off my mobile nd renew all profile still its not changing
No Connection with MY PCs so I was expecting use this for my Skype but NO WAY
The sound quality was excellent but the earpieces is flimsy and irreplacable terrific electrical engineerings poor mechanical engineering
Even wind didnt seem to bother the headsets much
The voice qualities was great on transmission and reception
But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and cant be replaced
The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacements again but I didnt want the hassle
I have a Scala now that Ive been using for months and Im very happy with it even though the sounds and windimmunity doesnts measure up to the Logitech
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wordings that they use to describe it is incorrect
To me the words charge all at once means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall
This item is simply a method for organizing you devices
Although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34
99 I paid and if it wasnt a gift and Christmas wasnt 3
I feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
In the ads this cables chargers claims to synced and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo
It will charge but I already have a homes and a car chargers so it serves me no purpose
My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting tasks of selling cells phones and service plans
I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this sites indicating the Pearl shipped hot with an active SIM which meant for those that like me were upgrading vs
new service their existing phones would stop working while the new phone was en route
To be fair that did NOT happen however I received the Pearl with a SIM cards that the phone would not accept
The instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the SIM turn on the phone and it will work
And if it doesnt work it says dont call Cingular call Amazon
I followed the instructions phone didnt work I called Amazon at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someones would be contacting me in 48 HOURS
I told him what I truly believe which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have to waited 2 days just to talk to someones about why my phone which is supposed to work out of the boxes isnt working
On a positive note I immediately called Cingular and they resolved the problem for me on the spot SIM was not activated in the system
Ive purchased this car chargers for my Treo and the
connector that was suppose to go into my Treo 650 did
not fitting too big so I wasnt able to connect it and
when it arrived the cable did not list my phone model numbers and the software listed all other models
and it never worked even messed up my phone a little
Too many options and I spent 2 hours trying to figured it out
I bought this product for my cell wiches was listed on their description and it so happens that the software will not work they did not sent the drivers I would not do business with this people again
this has not only been a waistes of money but also a waistes of times
Amazon should not permit them taken peoples money like that
Junk Sent with a CD that had a USB driver but wouldnt work on two different computers
Contacted the shipper Bargaincell but their only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed
The email stated emphatically that they dont provide supports for the products
I bought this product to download pictures from my cell phones onto the computer
The description stated that it would work for my selected model phone however it does NOT The software needed to download the pictures is not correct
When we called the customer services they were of no help they had no idea what to say or do to correcting the problem
Apparently I am not the only person to have this problem with the product
Again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this datas cable are NOT accurate
This product is the worst of its kind It lasted a couples of months at the most it is not at all worth the price no matters how cheap
I picked one up at WalMart for tens bucks that works great dont waste your times on this one
It is cheap but dont was had stay away from this product
It fell in the toilet though and they didnt sell them anymore at the Virgin webstore so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store
It is awful with the poor sound quality short battery lives horrible ringtones and worst of all I was unable to ever retrieve my voicemail Hello and it has the most horrible graphics
Does anyone want to buy it along with all the accessories It is barely used
So I looked on Ebay and found a used 8500 and bid on it won it and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610
I like the 8500s microsize simplicity ringtones animated graphics etc
I must be careful not to lose it or drop it in the toilet again though
My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one but I can not gets another replacements as I bought this one used
The pay as you go works fine for me as I do not wanted to have a cells phone clued to my head
I use it to check my land lines for messages and for brief calls
This reviews is more about Virgin Mobil customers service than the phones
I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1222007 online thrus Virgin Mobile
I called customers service and explained the problem
I replied that I could not told if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please sends a new kit
I received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldnt charge
I called customer services and explained the issue and it must be the chargers at faults
The rep said they would not send a new charger that I would hadn't to purchase one
I said this didnt make any sense according to the offer I could returning the phones for a full refund and does that means that to get a new phone and charge I need to return the phones for a refunds and then orders another one to got a chargers The supports rep said yes and that I had to make up my minds either return the phones or purchases a chargers
The customer supports reps kept going off line to talking to someones but refused or couldnt get a supervisor to talked to me
When I said I didnt know what an ESN number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the
Im not clear why she needed this since I havent activated the phones and I already referenced the order vmu number
At any rate I had been on the phones now for over 40 min with the supports rep obviously not very cost effective for virgins mobile and at least she was trying to track down some info or so I thought she finally came back on lines and said that the computer was down and she couldnt handle my orders that I would had to call back
I called back had to worked my ways thru the answerings systems and got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike
Mike explained that they couldnt send a chargers none in stock and that I would have to send the entire phone back which is what I am now doing 60 minutes after the initial call
I have to say that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive
They customer service staff is obviously poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions
The interfaces with support are youth geared not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally
I am sending the phone back for a refund and reconsidering the provider for payasyougoes service
I replaced a Kyocera that I disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not begin to makes up for its problems
The menus are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and its hard to do anything
The ringers speaker is inside the phone so when its closed its almost impossible to hear
I usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phones off the vibrates gets turned off so you have to remember to turning that back on I hate this phone and will be replacing it soon
I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VMs warranties was up and i had just purchased a 20 phone card had airtime credits which were not refundable
Now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment
My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches whatsoever so i was pretty upset
After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they werent going to do anything to help
Obviously I didnt want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couples of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610
By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN when i called to activate the phonethey have the nerve to tell me that I couldve purchased the same 8610 from them at a discounts price of 24
The fng idiotsHELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONERand after i spent 50 taxes
the ringers is indeed low as others have reported here
Its so low that if its in my purse i cant even hear it WTF Also the battery lives sucks no sooners does the thing ring and the batteries at halves
It also doesnt get good service with the VMSprint network my slider had xcellent service wit despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls
So Ive had it 5 days and Im considering attempting to bringing it back where I purchased it from
However i dont want to buy an expensive phone from VM because Im seriously reconsidering continuing wthems
The way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell they are expensive
I am a lite users but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet wise
Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customers but not anymore
The phone may be fine but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile services never really worked
Perhaps it was the phones fault I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account
I had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right
I spent hours on the phones with them and never had the problems fixed
Now I have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service
I plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone
I went with the TMobile Sidekick and already am way happier
This phone could quite possibly am the biggest piece of technology craps
Its useless the software on it is very cheap and childish
Not professional at all the camera is pitiful and the keys are too small for anyones who doesnt have 10yr old hands
Just because it has a qwerty keyboard that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phones when in realities this is a wastes of cash
Purchase a different phone this one is not worth it
Bought a cell phones battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadlines
Shouldnt a cell phone batteries last longer than a months They refuse to refund or replace
They are a shady company and Ill never do businesses with them again and will warn others to do the same
Coming from the Blackberry 8700c this phones is a big disappointment
Works issued this and took away the Blackberry and Im stuck with it
All I can don't is whine on the Internet so here it goes
Use the extended battery throw away the standard one
The keys are too small the 5way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally
Why do applications not quitted when you end them Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the tasks managers
The menu is preloaded with goodies to buy from Cingular how convenients
Grade C if you bother to learn the shortcuts key
HELLO This is suppose to be an MP3 player right Somebody explain to me why this is OK
The phone works great reception is great speakerphone is great
Outlook emails This is workable but difficult
You can writes an email you can editorializing your schedule and tasks but its not easy
If Blackberry gets and A and it does Blackjack gets a C
It doesnt synch notes so if youre an Outlook Notes people youre just left out sorry
The camera seems to work fine although I may use it twice per years
In short if you really want to get work done on your phone gets a Blackberry
If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice this could be the one for you
After owning 3 Blackberrys over the years I made the switches to the BlackJack because of the camera and the abilities to added memory
Compared to the Blackberry the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome for me and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially
On the plus side the Blackjack has good battery lives the screens is excellent and it has the best reception Ive ever experienced
The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink ie the numbers began wearing off the keys
Its to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable especially when its backlit
I called Cingular first who passed me on the Samsung where after 2 hours on the phone I was told that my only option was to sends the phone my primary sources of communication to their service center and 3 weeks
To my surprise they went on to say that at their discretions they might also charge me for the repair
Ive read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that Ive encountered this I do feel its worths considering
If youre thinking about a Blackjack I encourage you to am not aware that for one the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys and that you may well wasn't on your own when it comes to service
I feel that its reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right
You have to repeatedly tugging at this thing to get it to retract
The wires is very thin so Im thinking it will not last long
I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and its nice to haven't one charging while Im using the otheryous dont have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone
So I also bought one of Boxwaves batteries for the 8525
Well the spare batteries charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine but it refuses to charges the batteries that came with my 8525
This really limits its usability as an offline chargings devices
The cradle itself plugs into the USB ports on the phone which was not designed with cradlings in mind so its not easy to got the things lined up to use as an actual cradle
Since the camera buttons is on the bottom of the phones whos ideas was that anyway it almost always gets pressed while Im wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle
This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quitting the camera application every times you put it in or take it out of the dockings station
Anyway just my opinion but its actually easier to connect the standard USB chargers to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle so Id recommend saving your money and just sticking with the standard USB chargers
If you really want to don't all charging offline you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one
I ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails
This case actually scratches and destroys your pearl
The insides is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone
When I first received the items they didnt work and them I returned and had to spend more money and they still dont work
I even had the computer specialists at work try and they couldnt even gets them to work
I sent them a email to receive my money back because I didnt want to kept spending money to sends items back that dont work back
I will never buy any from you again and will informs others to bewaring
Im afraid the phone will fall off any second if I use it
After hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to works It eventually allowed me about an hours of connected time and then never worked again
The extra moneys worth paying to avoid the headache
What a waste of 20 bucks The skin hinders the cameras functionality
A very small portion of the FlexiSkin blocks the camera lens thereby messing up the photos
I had to trim a portions of the skins away in order to take unobstructed pictures
Next it makes your otherwise superpimps phone look like a bulky piece of junk more akin to a ZachMorris style Nokia from 1993
Additionally The FlexiSkin actually TRAPS dusts and other particles between the skins and the phone
This item blows in both functionality and aesthetics dont waste you money
First time when I plugged in the cell phone displayed errors message that Charging Error remove immediately
I ordered this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phone
I was so happy to see the package to arrive since using my finger or a pens is not an optimal way to work with this device
Sadly these replacement parts do not match the factories specifications
These styluses do not fit into their slot properly leaving the heads sticking out further than the manufacturer designed
This makes it easy for the styli to falling out and does not create a smooth and clean design looks for the phones with the replacement installed
If you are particular about these things you will not were satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not matched the picture that was advertised
I am disappointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
If you are particular about these things you will not is satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised
I am disapointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
The items did not works with my Tmobile MDA except in one ear buds
This has all of the features of the headsets that came with my phones and it was much less expensive than buying a replacements headset from Tmobile
Brand new and I had to jiggle the cable near the plugs to get it to work
In order to fit anyones but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart which could have broken the wires if I werent careful and may tear further through wearing it
The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces this means that the mikes is lodged at my addams apple
There are several places which Im worried will break soon through normal wears and tear
The ear pieces are hard plastic and look like theyll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time
The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music
Also be warned that shipping was listed as 5 for a 7 items when it was sent in an envelopes that only needed 23 stamps
The cable is barely 3 feet long from mike to plug so I dont recommends it for tall people
It will do until I can find better but thats the best I can sa
No driver was included and no drivers are available online for this
Nones of the drivers that came with the packages worked either
As for their return policy after a couple email exchanges they just sent me an address they did not comment on paying for shipping or giving me any compensation
I dont want to wrap something up that I already paid shippings for when it was already an inexpensive item
i didnt got the car chargers i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it
It has a samsung logo but it looks fake after I bought it
The belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason
This product had a strong rubberpetroleum smells that was unbearable after a whiles and caused me to return it
I guess you get what you pay for so I wasnt totally surprised that the battery didnts work
What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paid for it
Dont do businesses with these guys and dont buy this battery
I cant complain about shipping it was really fast
The 2nd time i plug it in the metals piece that plugs into the phone jams back inside the plastic housings that was holding it making a freakin paper weight
I ordered before brent birckheads review came up and I got taken
The correct internal dimension is 4 x 1 34 x 0
5 clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into
Considering that the seller enters the product dimensions as 4 ounces instead of the measurments one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake
I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the descriptions properly
All I want is a cables to sync my phone and update software
Half of the time the computer fails to recognize the phones is connected
A motorolas brands dataonly cables works just fine
I was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened
The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers
Problem is the things connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connectingdisconnecting as mentioned above
This cord 10 30 for moto cords when you realize its junk
I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the original Palm Pilot and have loved them I think I had three different models over the years
I wanted a smart phone so I could check my emails so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm product and so I could stay with my current mobile providers Cingular
Now I am counting the days until my 2 years commitments ends so I can punt this awful awful product
I may even bite the bullet and pays off my commitment early just so I can get rid of it
You must remember to stick this in a charger whenever you can
If you forget and leave it in your pocket overnight then it will be dead the next day
I have turned off every thing I can finding that sucks power and it still drains amazingly fast
It wont even last a day if you make very many calls
Ive had a Cingular phone for a long times and was able to get good reception over most of So
With this phone I think you have to am right underneath an antennae to get a signal
I was on a conference call yesterday and got dropped twice
I am envious everytime I get in an elevator with someones who can talk on their cell phone because ours will freeze up any time I try that
The only way I have found to unfrozen it is to take out the batteries and let it do a hard reboot
The versa mail program that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with
You must leaved your work computers on to check the corporate mail
That means if I am traveling with my computer the phones corporate mails program will not work
I dont thought the browser that comes with the phones will working with Java so I can not check my Yahoo mail eithers
I tried going back and forths to the preJava version of Yahoo and that is too much of a pain
I havent ever been able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacies files from my previus palms software something that never happened when I upgraded before
It is hard to use on line so I guess I need to bites the bullets and prints out the whole thing and then taken a week of vacation to read it and see if I can make any of these neat functions that I read about work
Hardly a week goes by that I dont actively thought how much I hate this phones
I actually signed on to Amazon today just to written this because the phone wasnt working properly todays
Palm could not resolve all the issues associated with Treo
I bought this phone few days back and it freezes frequently
Ive had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular
Ive gone through 4 phones the same things over and over
Never did they or I put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD card although right now its working and the cards is not in it go figure
So I guess the options are not download things but have the phone work or download things onto my SD card and not have a phone
A slight warpage of back piece of my plastic case made
You wont know if your cases will fitted until you try to putting it on
I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years
Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price I thought my fulfilled contract I am on month to month now meant I could qualifying for a new account and keep my numbers
After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly I had to returns it
It is ironic that someones who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 year customer I will took the next carriers that offers a reasonable prices on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750
It shipped via FEDEX on 32907 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3207
The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the packages being signed for
This was after Id already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving
FEDEXs response for it sitting three days on the delivery trucks was that the driver was overloaded
For the 100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store
battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of the times
The product was sent with a plastic bags no manual not anything only the base and thas ac charger wall
When I tried it s not working neither the cradle neither the aditional battery chargers
I got rid of the bulky i355s at the ends of our contract and bought two of these for our accounts
We had to return the first phone line1s within days of getting it as it would randomly shuts off crash and other times the volume would fluctuate on its own
Exchanging it was an ordeals with Sprint they charged me for the replacement phone and still havent credited my account after two billing cycles
A few months later and now the second phone line2 is crashing
Other times it will shut off in the middle of the call
The other night I went to charge it and it said invalid battery so I took the battery out and put it back in
I might going back to the i355 it was rugged reliable but large phone
I guess Ill have to haggled with Motorola about getting this one fixedreplaced
How hard can it is shipped a cells phone carrying case instead of a charger
I owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
I can be moving 20 mphs on my bicycles talking to someones with no problems
It has far better sound quality than my backup which is a Jabra with no booms
The ear volume is adjustable on my phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont let them adjust the volume
As noted by another reviewers this headset does not come with any buttons or switches the only thing on the cords is a shirt clip
6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
The headset is very easy to slip into my ear only takes 1 seconds and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sore
My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly stay on the phones longer than 2 hours its something to keeping in mind
However it suits my needs just fine and for the low price I think its really a great buy
The sound is great and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
The bud actually sits comfortably in my ears this is a first and my neice used the extra bud for her MP3 player and loved them
The devices works fine and I dont feels I over paid
Sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable
My perceptions is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarities of my voices is fine
I higly recommend it over the other types of headset
i helped developed the danger hiptop akas tmobiles sidekick and hated holding its bricklike natures to my head
the only problems is i hate earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics stores and abusing their return policy bought one of every headset they had to trying 23 headsets to isn't exact
i picked up the jabra only to be a completeist figuring there was no ways id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear stylings
but after trying them all the jabra was easily the best feeling and best fitting
in a nutshells here are the things i like about this unit in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the rights and the left so you get a chance to get a much closer fit than some generic ear piece
contrary to what others have said here the ears pieces stay very snug in your ears if they dont youre not fitting them correctly
is wear glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
i like having the model with the microphone booms over the classic earonly jabras because it
lets people know youre talking on the phone and less likely to interrupt you while youres talking
i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top downs and was heard without a tons of wind noise
its small and easy to wrap up into my cells cases
also in the newest version theyves adding a securing lips to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
is called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a balls point pen for my troubles
using one with my hiptop is a joy it means is can still contruct smss type in emails add messages and addresses to my address books whilst talking on the phones
if you have a data device of any kind this will make your phones experiences twice as good
a truly great products from a company that knows how to treat its customers right
granted Ive only used one other it was a flimsy little things that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound qualities and comforts
Where my friends would fall out of my ear this one once I got it figured out never comes loose
Second listenings to people on my friends I would have to turn up the sound to hear the people well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear moresoes than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shaped as you can see in the picture and there are six of them total three of them for each ears
Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this units the earpieces kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could I tried holding it in places with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinking of throwing it into traffics on I95
And then one day somehow I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear with the little pokyout part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top of your ears if you do that itlls just pop out again and then voila it stays put
Matter o fact itll stays put so well that itll be a little bit difficult even painful to get out again
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patiences levels and lower IQs might hadn't different experiences than my own
But all I can say is that once I had this little buggers figured out I was golden
I love this thing and almost never talks on the phones without it
Admittedly it is a bits difficult to got into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to gets in properly before youre good and practiced at it which may not sound like a lot but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hearing the first sentence they say or whatever
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and starts a conversations without missing a beat
In fact I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or something
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with Nokia phones
In fact it even says right on the packages that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone both of which claim to being Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt work with all Nokia phones
While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didnt include ours it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my models the 3590 which piqued my curiosities
And so I went to the friendly managers of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me tests both of them
The strange part of it was that we couldnt sees a visible difference in the two units
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the pictures you can see them while the other one the ones marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to either know your phones well as in have the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comforts but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging
Several months later the little pieces of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the people at the other end
And living in windy Providence this is a bit of an annoyance
Also for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldnt hear the people on the other end of the lines and likewises they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
Now for some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Im not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom
Either way its somethings buyers should be aware of
So I bought this things based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost yeah Amazon but thats not why Im writing this review
Id like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earbooms
The eargel thingies are designed quite well of the three different sizes for each ear youres bound to find ones that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt find any that fit my right ears comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mates on the other side
My wife had the exact opposite experiences hopefully our daughters will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comments on the fits during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the booms is quite secure when installed
Id have to imagines itd take a big hit to knocking it loose once in place
Sound qualities from the earbud is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity especially the higher frequencies
Normally this is not a problem but it can sometimes make the person youre talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to conversing without having the voices washed over with backgrounds noise
The gels block an appropriate amounts of external sounds allowing you to concentrated on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear says an ambulance while driving
There is a small slots on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drums while the rest of the gel fits snugs to the ears blocking out other stray noise paths
Ive asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive my voice comes through loud and clear despite the booms apparent lacks of lengths reinforcing my belief that sizes DOESNT matter
In fact I have found the mics to be very sensitive to even small sounds
Forget talking on the phones and subtly typing on the keyboards our mouse click surfing theyll hear every click
Another example I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pools 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears
Not that its obtrusive to the other person on the phones its just good to was aware they can hear it all
Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommending this product
In facts I just ordered another it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to isn't listed because very clearly in BOLD letterswithin the titleits says 2
Know your phone and your aquisitions before giving a bad review
Ive been using my T809 since January and mostly loves it
1 There is some sorts of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screens where dust gets in behind the screen lens
Ive reads that other people have this problem too
2 I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset they wont stay in my ears and because you cant hear the phone ring over the headsets while listening to music
3 The rings starts off softly and builds to a louder volumes
If I have the phone in my pockets I miss the first couple of rings too quiet and by the times I realize Im getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket Ive usually missed the calls
This sucks and I dont think theres a setting to disable this feature
But Ill probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires
BTW if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone make sure you see it on the bills
I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying
TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance but fortunately Amazon exchanged it
Ive always stayed away from the flipslider phones because Im good at breaking things
Ive had this ones for almost six months and its still going strong
You can check all the specs online and in other posts
The one I got my phones will slip out of it once in a whiles
If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msgs boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it
If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ears headsets
if you do not known the best thing about this ophones then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly things dont byes this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephones is that the telephones that is a razor does not have a chiord on it why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesnt have a chord
Are you kidding me Were going to setting up an EarGel Xchanges Will this be domestic the Americas or are we going EnterGnashinAll with this PUPPY
Ok Ill do the web site were going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one
Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture Distribution is going to wasn't biggest problems here Im thinking we dont give UPS a looks lets hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates
Its gambles but if we can drives down the shipping costs it should kept those Johnny Gels come lately from jumping into arena
Ill go ahead and have a talks with some of the other players in the community Ive got a 5 year nocompete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my bs over this they want 9 of the gross ad revenue from www
com but after we secure the ventures capitals Ill tell those jokers to take a hikes
Allright lets get this things moving folks great ideas have a shelflives and the clock is ticking
If anyone knows of one can you please post that information here
These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to heard others speaking say in a groceries stores
Of course they do not provide audiophile qualities sound but theyre great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping
The only downside is they are bulky and so doesn't not fit in any earbud holders while not in uses
Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
My ears are a funny shape and I cant wear regular earbuds but when I add these gels they fit great and dont fall out
They block outside noise and make the sounds quality like those expensive soundisolatings earbudss
Sometimes I need a Small and sometimes I need a Medium depending on the days the weathers and how long I use them
I gave the Large sizes to my boss and he loves them too so dont say you cant use all of the sizes guys
I do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postages
Tmobiles services may not is the best but I have had no problems with the phone itself
For all the people saying that it isnt really magentaIt is
The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink the tmobile phones is the hot pinks magenta shown
I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades
Having had every new gadgets imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phones because I can take pictures and make video I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday Perhaps I just got a bad battery but Ive NEVER had to charge any phone daily
If youre a shutterbugs like me you will loved this phone
I didnt even mention the hot pinkmagenta color which all gals love
One note of caution If you live in hurricanes alley like me you may want to carry a spare batteries just in case they dont take down the cell phone towers before the storms
It may be useless locally but you can at least told your people youre still among the living and need money to escape the carnage
I have a TMobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months
In fact when I had issues with my first one TMobile replaced it
This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology
And I love the color causes it sticks out everywhere
They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this
I personally dont minds the supposedly tedious software
Of courses I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brands for this phone
It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual
Overally I will continue to stick wTMobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphones
I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldnts be happier
I have had it for about a month and hadn't had no problems at all
Tmobile is not a very good service in my opinions and that is why I chose Cingular
The device works fine and I dont feel I over paid
Sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable
My perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voices is fine
I higly recommend it over the other types of headsets
is helped develop the danger hiptop aka tmobile sidekicks and hated holding its bricklikes nature to my head
the only problems is i hate earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics store and abusing their returns policy bought one of every headset they had to try 23 headsets to am not exact
i picked up the jabra only to was a completeist figuring there was no way id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear styling
but after trying them all the jabra was easily the best feeling and best fitting
in a nutshell here are the things i like about this units in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the rights and the lefts so you get a chance to get a much closer fit than some generic ear pieces
contrary to what others have said here the ear pieces stay very snug in your ear if they dont youres not fitting them correctly
i wear glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
i like having the model with the microphone booms over the classic earonly jabra because it
lets people know youre talking on the phones and less likely to interrupt you while youre talking
i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top downs and be heard without a tons of wind noise
its small and easy to wrap up into my cells case
also in the newest versions theyve adding a securing lip to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problems before
i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a ball point pens for my troubles
using one with my hiptop is a joy it means is can still contruct smss type in emails add messages and addresses to my address book whilsts talking on the phone
if you have a datas devices of any kinds this will make your phone experience twice as good
a truly great products from a company that knows how to treat its customers right
granted Ive only used one other it was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sounds qualities and comforts
Where my friends would fall out of my ear this one once I got it figured out never comes loose
Second listening to people on my friends I would have to turn up the sounds to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phones and they sound crisp and clear moreso than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friends calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shaped as you can see in the pictures and there are six of them total three of them for each ear
Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ears as hard as I could I tried holding it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I95
And then one day somehows I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ears with the little pokyout part stuck in the folds of your ear next to the ear canals not the fold on the top of your ear if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
Matter o facts itll stay put so well that itll be a little bits difficult even painful to get out again
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patiences levels and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own
But all I can saying is that once I had this little buggers figured out I was golden
I love this things and almost never talks on the phone without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly before youre good and practiced at it which may not sound like a lot but its long enough to not recognized somebodys voice or hear the first sentence they say or whatever
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat
In fact I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or somethings
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with Nokia phones
In fact it even says right on the packages that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone both of which claim to am Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt works with all Nokia phones
While browsing at the stores I noticed that the ones that claimed to weren't Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didnt include ours it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my models the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them
The strange part of it was that we couldnt see a visible differences in the two units
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to either know your phone well as in have the little book handy or ask for helps before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to take it down a notches for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packagings
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the winds becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end
And living in windy Providence this is a bit of an annoyance
Also for a while I was having a problems where the earpieces would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldnt hear the people on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jacks
Now for some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Im not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom
Either way its something buyers should be aware of
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundles over the local retail cost yeah Amazon but thats not why Im writing this review
Id like to talked about the performance and comfort of the Earbooms
The eargel thingies are designed quite well of the three different sizes for each ear youres bound to find one that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt finding any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side
My wife had the exact opposite experiences hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed
Id have to imagine itd take a big hits to knock it loose once in place
Sound qualities from the earbuds is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity especially the higher frequencies
Normally this is not a problem but it can sometimes make the people youres talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tunes into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse without having the voices washed over with background noise
The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussions at hand without impeding your abilities to hearing say an ambulance while driving

Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears
Not that its obtrusive to the other people on the phone its just good to be aware they can hear it all

If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phones to my new BMW
I owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
I can been moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someones with no problems
It has far better sound quality than my backups which is a Jabra with no booms
The ear volume is adjustable on my phones and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont lettering them adjust the volume
As noted by another reviewer this headsets does not come with any buttons or switches the only thing on the cord is a shirts clip
6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
The headset is very easy to slip into my ear only takes 1 seconds and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sore
My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours its something to keeps in mind
However it suits my needs just fine and for the low price I think its really a great buys
The sound is great and the sleaks design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headsets might last a bit longer than others
The bud actually sits comfortably in my ears this is a first and my neice used the extra bud for her MP3 players and loved them
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it
If you make a lots of cells phone calls this is a very good ear headset
if you do not know the best things about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing donts bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephones is that the telephone that is a razor does not having a chiord on it why would you by a chords for a telephone that is so great because it doesnt have a chords

I purchased the pinks razr with Cingular service and couldnt am not happier
I have had it for about a months and have had no problems at all
Tmobile is not a very good service in my opinions and that is why I chose Cingular
Sorts of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel
Some of the soft touches is coming off at the corners with wear but its still red which is nice
I will probably get another color on it for spring
The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually asked me where I got my razr since the Sprint reds is a little different
Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m
I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot
Black leather blue piping going around the edge
The blue is that vivid color that one of those exoticexpensive fish tank fish have neons or tetras Whichever it is it is very sharp looking
It does not add much bulksizeweight to the phone
When I am taking a photos I simply unsnap the half that is on the flipup half of my cell phones which is where the camera lens is take the photos and slip it back on
Before I used to know about this I used to press down a little straps on it that would got in the way like a wayward lock of hair
Turns out that futzing with the straps is unnecessary
They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case takes photos and snap it back on
In facts the reason the straps is there in the first places is so you can easily remove the other half
Look what is on the ends of that strap before you curse it guys
Its a snap Snaps unsnaps that is what they are for
It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand
I can easily pivot it around in my hands flips it around pick it up and basically not expecting it to skidding around
Without the Glove you have a bares metal or plastic case
Smooth looking and well maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars
I think it is at the bottom not at the back the ways some people have said but I can not remember for certain
I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet
The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s
With the glove on I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily
Ive dropped it many times and this case protected it like I wanted
Having room for the extended batteries is great too because the extended batteries adds hours and hours too the life of my phone
Was received in a timely manners however the picture onlines was not what I expected
For the price I really thought it was a little cheap looking in person
As it was a gifts I was somewhat disappointed in the quality
This headseat is pretty neat when youre on the road or just relaxing between works
It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a calls and also controls the pauseplay and answerhangups features
The comfort of the ear budds could be a little better but the stereo sound is great
The only area of improvements would be the belts clip
I Really like this phone the camera quality the software everything is excellent
Unfortunately you could not use some of these features in the U
One thing I do not understands why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price
The phones gets 5 stars but the retailers prices gets 2 stars
I will keep this short and to the points this is the best phone I have ever owned
Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear
Replacing my Nokia N90 with this models the photos are much better both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses but this is 3
Also the N73 covers all radios bands making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere supposedly two internal antennae
The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular so depending on the cities I was in I occasionally had very spotty coverages
The Symbian operatings system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90 and best of all it is much more compact than the N90 fits nicely in the palm of my hands and in my jeans pocket
Last there is a very smooth operating lenses cover on the back of the phones protecting the cameras lenses why arent they all like this
As usual the flash isnt the equivalents of even a moderate digital cameras but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds
its 12 cents per minutes which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost
Perfect for my occasional use and for locating families members when Im in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing
I dont use cell phones much but if I must hadn't one I might as well have one that doesnt make me worrying about another huge bill
For kids who think they can mangle the budget forget it cuz when the cards is used up thats it kiddo
Once they use up the cards the only number they can dial is 911 but thats it
Bonus features clocks is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to gotten up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the ends of the day
At some point I might not be able to live without this
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anythings youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screens protectors are that very thin materials that you stick on the screens hopes against hopes that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to makes sure its on there good
This is the states of the art for screen protectors
And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screens will get dulled and scratched
Because of the thickness and quality of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
I was completely satisfied with the phones clips I purchased
I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND
I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN
I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE
I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON
Ive been using this phone with the Net10 service since March and have to say I am very happy with it
I dont use a cell phones very often so this was the most economical way for me to go
Although the phone doesnt have all the bells and whistles like other phones have
Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER
I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare
I got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper
OverallI would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week
The service has been good and the features are easy to use
The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phones will last
The flip parts is a little weak but we will have to see
It was really easy to add minutes and you can do it right from your Net10 phone
The silicone protective coverings for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt am not happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brands prior to that
As others have noted it does increasing the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protections
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratches
I like the designs of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holders but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handlings
Only disadvantages is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and buttons on the Treos
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The buttons layouts is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to sees if theres a way to remove these somehows
After buying the new LG Chocolate I found that I needed to buy a new cars charger for it
I searched the Internet and found this one to be the best value
When I first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as I opened the packages and put my phones in it I could tell it was a perfect fit
I really like the clear window which I did not hasn't on my previous case now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every times
Wind noice no problem user friendly coustomer support for Cardo is great
My only complaint and consequently the 4star rating is that sometimes I dont hear the Blackberry or feel the vibration
Apart from that this holster is a vast improvements over the OEM plastic holster
I have had 2 Zire models and managed to break both screens
My dislikes is that I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer forming fitting
I have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avail
As for the SD card issue I remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blades to allow rooms for the cards to clearly eject
To keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo I drilled a holes in the back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes
The skin is very useful but can be improved on ways to put it on and takes it off
Im not really a gadget guys and what gadgets I do have gotten pretty beat up
When the company gave me a Treo 650 so I can stay in touches I needed to at least take care of the thing
Im a minimalist and for that the Treo 650 Skin is perfect A cool look not bulks
Iam very pleased with this item I purchased it for my sons
00 battery and I thought my phone was broken because of the ways it was acting
I replaced my new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ
Just get this battery and you will not have my problems
This items works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
The only problem is that the clip to attach to your shirts tends to fall off
When I bought my Motorola V220 my Cingular Store charged top dollar for the cars charger and they were sold out
I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon
The cars chargers is compatible with the V220 and it comes with cases and handsfree ears bud all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone
The ear buds does not having the best sound voices come across as somewhat muffled though still audible and the case is adequate
I wouldnt buy this set specifically for those items although they both work withfit the V220
As I see it they were bonuses for purchasing the charger
The product is compact and convenient but it feels flimsy
The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard resets of my Palm TXso it was not a cables problems but a problems with my TX
For some reason the cables wonts letter me charge using the USB wallcharger I got for my wifes iPod but it does charge the TX off my computers USB port which is a Powerbook G4notorious for being underpowered
Great reception great volumes controls easy to use
To the reviewer who said too thin well dont gets the thin phone then
Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra plugs in even comes with the adaptor for plugs in phones
Were in our late 20searly 30s and just dig the phone
One issues DH has the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into bottom of the phone and when he is on speaker phone he tends to hold it there and it sometimes can make your bars go down
That is it and all you have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone
its cute its little its perfect for a young woman
I had a pockets pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call
I wanted something simples that wasnt an mp3 players i have an ipods that wasnt a professional camera i have a nice digital cams or a pda is have a palm tx
although doesnt works that great with my bluetooth but im not sure if its the headset or the phones
almost to the points you can barely heard it in your purse
im grown accustomed to listening for the vibrate features instead
i like how you can putting a persons picture next to their name in your contact list
i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable
I have trouble to buy from Bestbuy but I ordered it from amazon cheapest price and good products Thanks
The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from Scratches it fits like a gloves really nice the deliveries from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of use it wasnt hit or treated carelessly
Ill order some more because they are really cheap and its better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone
Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition the cases started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it
The only complaints is that the case open easily if its dropped or handled in a rough way
Clear tapes on the seams can easily takes care of that
My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it
The case still does not having a chip or crack on it
it covers all of it so you dont need those plastic screens covers
I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and they last about sixtwelve months
I bought this one and it is much more solid of construction shorter cords and a better angle to the power adapter
i bought two of these for less than the costs of one from Sprints
My wives carries hers in her purse while I just keep mine in my car
This is the best cars charger for the Treo and I have had Treos for about 6 years
i like the catch that holds it on the belts to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far
The handsets is wonderful and so is the headset included with it
If you buy this phones it WILL last you a long time
with my phone I know that sounds absurd but its true
Originally I had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting this one seeing how I had already done so with the Motorola V3T
Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorolas V3T RAZR handsets both for having them freeze at startup I called customers service and told ems I wanted this handset instead
With a minor contract extensionhandset upgrades I was glad I made the switch to NOKIA
Ive only had it for 24 hours and Im totally satisfied with it
Below is a list of pros and cons for you to consider
MP3ringtones enabled make sures to cutting your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so
Pretty fast charge even while messing around with it
Bluetooth and infraredenabled making for quick files transfers
Dates can be enabled on screens which the V3T lacks
Comes with headphone jack adapters which enables uses of any standard headphone that you may had
Vibrate functionalities is disabled with handset charges by defaults
Power button is somewhat small and difficult to execute
FM radio plays with static this may varies by areas
As you can saw the pros outweight the cons with this one so give it at try
Also if you decide that its not for you return it to TMobile within 14 business days of your purchases and get a full refunds
As for me I wont returning it because its definitely a keeper
I purchased this phones to replacing my lands lines and have not been disappointed
I havent used all the functions yet downloading musics but havents had any problems with anything else
2Good Volume ringers volume is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine
1No shortcut to get to main menu have to keep pressing back buttons
2Battery access its really hard to take the casing off to get to the batteries and SIM cardcould be a good thing though
3OnOff Button its very smallbasically have to use my fingernail
I got a chance to play with one of these last week
The external speaker is very loud the controls are easy to use and best of all it comes with a 1GB card
My only gripes is the slides feels a little loose I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake
All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capabilitysoftware is a lots better than my KRZR
I purchased this Nokia 5300 Black at the TMobile store
It does come with 1 GB memory card and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last nights with no problems
Phone comes with USB cable to connect to your computers
You will not be able to download songs bought from iTunes but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4
I wasnt able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook but I was able to pairing with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car
Apple has not approved the Nokia 5300 yet to sync
I am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new
Overall I love the feels of this phones has wonderful 2 in screen color is great camera is cool and it is very intuitive to use
I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia
However the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned
Once you load up your songs the speaker is impressive
This mornings I had the phone playing music in one part of the house and I had to going get somethings at the other end of the houses and I could still hear the music perfectly
I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of peoplebackground noises and I was able to carrying on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my Samsungs that was difficult to do this with
And I am happy to have a phones that not everyone has a Motorola Razor
This Nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but I feel like I have a very unique phones that is more than a phone
Who needs an iPod mini when you can gets this and your phone all in one
I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone
There is very little to chose from at the TMobile store as far as accessories and Nokia
You can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increasing the volume of the song for your alarms
You can make calls without even having to slide the phone to dial
As long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book then all you have to do is look up and pressuring the green button
When you are playing your music if an incoming calls comes in it will stoppered playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in
Once you are done with the phone call you can resuming playing your music
As I said this phone is a gem in all areas speaker sturdy colorfuls I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing call qualities is great even in loud areas and lots of little creature comforts
Definitely consider this phones if you really like to have musics and bluetooth and speakerphones
I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part
The first things youll notice is how crisp and clear the screens is
This is a slider phone and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the numbers keys
The only things that I can thought of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number thats not in your contacts and to text message
3MP camera camcorder music player 1GB microSD cards bluetooth supports and infrared ports
Now the FM radio isnt satellite based so you can not pick up radios stations from across the U
Now I will go into the good and bad things about each feature
3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras but can you showing me a camera that does what this phone does 55
While you are recording the quality seems perfect
However once you play it it turns a bit distorted
Plus it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card
However I still could not found a way to changed the order of the songs without making a playlist
Theres play pause next song previous songs fast forward and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures
The buttons must being pressed fairly hard so your music wont starts playing spontaneously in your pockets
Also I was blown away on how the qualities of the music improves once you put on those stocks earbuds
FM Radio I bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement
Well the truth is you dont need to buy anythings extra
Just plug in the earbudss that came with the phone and this will serve as an antennae and will allow you to hearing stations
And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio yes the sound will go to the earbuds
However theres a loudspeaker option that allows the radio to aren't played through the external speakers but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in as it serves as the antenna
This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone you NEED to have the earbuds with you
You may need to play around with the positions of the phone and antennae or you may have to move in orders to get clear reception
You cant delete the precreated profiles those that come with the phones
In order to changed the phones to vibrate you must make a vibratings profile
Then to use it it takes several steps which is not hard but inconvenient
The interfaces shows the month and date but not the day of the weeks
Its much faster than the old one I used for an earlier Ericsson CF388
Good product the retractable chord feature is great and keeps the car clutters free
This one is great the retractable wire is very convenient for storages and use
It looks pretty fragile but so far its held up to pretty heavy use
Many of the other chargers Ive owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection no such problems with this one
Easy to snap on and it wont come off easy like others
This is the one you want if you dont like the bulky one
It slides around too much it needs a smaller fits it is too big
I have a baby pinks Razr and this skin looks so good over it
Also it really adds grip so its not as easy to drop and the silicone stays warm in cold weather unlike the bares metals of the razr
I would reccomend a silicone skins cases for anyones with a razr they are awesome
This cover is great it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped
It isnt soft leather so if you want to protected your RAZR you might wanting to consider a shield
I think it will do a good job of protecting my phone in case I drop it
Hard shell protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable
protections on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover Ive seen for this phones
keeps keys and screen open so no dust gets pushed up against them
5mm jacks and still insist buying this after look at the image then what the hs
this cases is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky
thinking about buying a couple more in different color
I am very happy with the phones cases there are alot of cases available this is by far the best in my opinions
Wow I have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever
Clear soundgreat rangeand most of all its gorgeous
Only con being a loose fit around your ears and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly
It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it
It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days
I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size
Crystal clear sound along with being very comfortable and user friendly make this headsets a great cells phones accessory to have Love it Amazons price couldnts is beat
fully compatible with Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR
not the best sound quality I like Logitech betters
The sounds quality in both units are great but Im impressed by the weight of this LG unit
It is like comparing stones to feathers a bit exagerated but you get the point
This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud which sits snuggly in my ears
which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls
That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my head a bit to keep the units against my ears
With the new LG I no longer have to look like I have a stiff necks while Im driving
This item came with the other item I ordered at the same times
Its quality is good but does not stayed on the phone when opened as well as I would have liked
The title says it all Fits Great Great Price Real leather and fits like a glove
This product is a good deals if you know how to use it
Unfortunately if you are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider
The Verizon Vcast product would be better because it comes with Headphones
If you already have the headphones which cost anywhere from 20100 than this product will wasn't good for you
It fits great but doesnt cover the corners of the phones
The seams at the tops of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ears if not careful
The bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clips youre stuck with it sticking out in your pockets
I am using this as a spare so havent actually put it in the phone yet
is bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync an idiot design if you ask me and that areas near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires
and to buy a cradles which used to come with the palms was an extra 3040 so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing
the reason why it got only 4 stars is bc when i first tried it my computer said that it didnt recognize the usb devices
i searched everywhere for a technical answers as to why
it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2s more
so the connectors part could be a little sturdier thats all
Use it every day its a nice connector that does just what it says it does
As with all TreoPalm connectors you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection
Wiggling the connector where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to worked for me
Its not listed in the product description but you can find the info on ziplinqss web sites
The products works very well but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phones
Overall I would recommending it if the users pays attentions when connecting
Eventually prices will be free like the motorolas Razor V3
Receptions is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card
Video and voices recording capabilities and a 8x zoom cameras
I was expecting just to save the touchscreens from scratches but these screens make the touchscreen also feel better
Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough
Have been using just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all Ill need to replace it
The only problem might was that it is hard to pull it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone
It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did
For a holster is give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cells phone in places on your belt
One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the straps should be so having a straps on it wouldnt work too well
and also because it holds it where the strap is it adds a little wear to that areas
I paid 14 dollars for this at my local malls which was highly over priced for my standards
Amazon seems like a great place to buy it but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories then you can find a site with free shipping for it and its 7 bucks
Theres also another sites that has it for 3 bucks but with shippings
So if you want a functional holster get this one
I have had this phone and Virgin Mobile pay as you go service for only a days or two but I wanted to write this reviews before I forget
Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in its a good rides
Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screens but its a pleasant experiences
The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation
It seems a real nobrainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service
You can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuffbut youll have to get used to the funny graphics
You interact with the menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if youve been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences
One thing this whole services and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine thirties
While its a good basics cell phone and the plan is appealing pay as you gofor me 18cmin theres a tons of stuffs to play with if your trains gets stuck in a tunnel
I have Lily Tomlins operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds and if I should ever receive a text messages among my canned response options that come standard with the phone are Hell no Cant talk and Leave me alone
My friend has had one for a few months and loves his
He makes a good bit more monies than I and sports some fancy handheld devices so its not just that its so cheap and cool
Im a longrunning Virgin customers but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry and so Ive had experiences using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier including nonUS
Previous Virgin phones Ive used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255
My 8610 still works but its a bits bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrades
This is probably the cheapest phone of its sizecapabilities available anywhere
It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallets I sometimes forget its there
For the cost it is pretty decent in terms of features
128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support 10 MB for downloads 32 total speakerphone web capabilities comparable performances to most Nokia series 40 devices
For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight
Ive found this to be very reliable in my area and signal qualities is excellent both in and outdoors
Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell which was also good my old Kyocera on the other hand was garbage
The phones graphics are a bit odd but not necessarily in a bad ways
Good library of games ringtones and graphics available
Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on
Its no good if you want video on demand 3G or whatnot
But for just making callstexting now and then you simply cant beat 203 months
No annual contract as well which is a huge plus as many whove had one know all too well
They are a bit stiff as well which is good and bad good because you wont accidentally pressed them as easily bad because typing is more of a pain
Their web service costs extra and it has problems viewing many pages formats says networks gremlins when you try
You can browse basic html and thats about it good luck reading email with it
No bluetooth builtin though this is to be expected
This can actually been a good thing since camera phones are offlimits in more areas than you might expect
There are flaws with it as with any phone but the pluses outweigh the minuses
Ive seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone but in my professional opinion and it is an expert opinions these people need to realize that you get what you pay for
This isnt a 200 Samsung T519 and youres not paying 60 a months for service on a 2 years contract
Considering the costs the Slice is an great handset with excellent service and that is that
Ive been a Virgin Mobile customers for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewerifs you want a phonephones without all the extra hooplas this isnt a bad deals
I bought a red Slice a couples of weeks ago take note that Im not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear and for my needs emergencies quick calls to families from the grocery store its just rights
I got ours for free with Reward Zone points at Best Buy
Nice looking someones mistook it for a Chocolate the other day
Clear receptions long distance calls are just as crystal as local not sure if this is an area thing but apparently the services in and around Chicagos solid
Payasyougo option works well for someones who doesnt spend a lots of time on the phone
My Slice holds a charge just fine Ive noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem but so far so good and doesnt heats up as someones else mentioned maybe that reviewers got a defective phone or battery
Its so slim my husband has bet me Ill lose the phones within a couples of months could aren't easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desks
Someone else mentioned the odd graphics hot dog dripping blue sauces some sort of pipes looking cartoons with teeth
Seriously I have no idea what those things might be but I say its workable if you have a sense of humor
I have small hands slender fingers and I still manage to bump the 3 whenever Im trying to shut off the phone
Sometimes its difficult to turn on the button doesnt always respond when I push it though could were Im a wimp but once its on its fine
Im thinking this will get broken in with more use
I find myself staring at it just to appreciates its beauty phones confessions
And since I havent forked out hundreds of dollarsors any dollars reallyI wont felt too guilty whenif I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork
I got my Slicer past black Friday for 19 from Radio Shack to use in the cases of emergency
The Virgin plan 18 cmin pays as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phones for what they were originally made to do
First 20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 months one has to recharge account once every three months to keeps the accounts active despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30cmin to Eastern Europe
I used the phones on my business trip to call home
The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phones so far
They also have planty of ring tones and graphic options
for downloading mostly priced about 2 per download
The phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuffs except a camera
However the memories is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for 19
I am surprised to hear that other people complained about the batteries lives
The only bad thing I discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone for example during the flight I had to reconnect phones to charger in orders to activate it again
I would sincerely recommend the phone and the Virgin pays as you go plan to mature users
1 When a headset is attached the phones does not ring through the external speakers
So if you are not wearing the headsets when a calls comes in
2 There is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time
In Standby the phones runs out of powers after about six hours
To reply to a text you have to start a new messages and then searches for the sender of the original message
5 The rings tones that come with the phone are horrible
Aside from those few problems I have been quite satisfied with the phone
I got this phones to use as a phone and am very happy with it
I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review
I have a nice canon camera and dont want to use my phone to took pictures
I dont want to use my phone to listening to music or surf the internet either I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there
If you are one of those people that has a different agendas for your phone then this is probably not the phone for you
This phones is comparable to a Hershey bars in thicknesses and width but shorter
It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky
It makes a razr feels thicks but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvrs
The Slice has good sound qualities for such a small phone
Sprints network is not the best in my areas but my slices has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar
When I was in the car the roads noise got too loud to hear but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine and keeps my hands on the wheels
Virgins is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phones a lot
I expect to spend between 150 and 200 this first year including the 50 up front for the phones
The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included
Although I havent tried them it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level
Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it it also looks like a real piece of equipment
As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phones on the conference table in a meeting with the VP
in vibrate mode of courses At the same time my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and getting another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool
The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu
What were they smoking when they decided to use a pig for my accounts a dragon for messaging etc
Other than that the features are all where you would expected them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive
Cant really comment on reliabilities on this phone after just two weeks but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine
Perhaps because they are affordable in other ways Virgin screws you on ringtones and background
The four ringtones included are unacceptable and you are blocked from up or down loading your own
They do have a pretty big collection on their website you can get for 2
The included wallpapers were chosen to being the most despicable choices possible too so you are likely to fork out 2
00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well
Most of the times I do fine but every once in a whiles I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small
Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I havent run into that problems any more
Battery life has not lived up to what I read but that might is because of how I use it
I ordered an extra charger to kept in the offices and one for the car as well just in cases
After two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phones calls
It is not big on extras like a camera but what it does it does well
Virgin uses Sprints network see if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a Virgin phone
I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now
Ive used it for 3 years and really like its basic functionality
The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and thats pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have lowbattery life
Im hoping itll last for 2 more years before I get a new phone to caught up with the modern world
Saves times and updownloading pics tunes tofrom my phone
The Speck rubber case is the best case ives found for my Blackberry 7290
That being said its not ideal and id make a few changes
Pros protects cases well no screen scratches minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bags no needs to use the belt clips most women prefer pursestotebags to belt clips and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages no needs to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag
Cons clear cases collects dirts screen covers is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlights screen cover doesnt fit squarely into the rubbers cases and screens cover gets scratches on it making the screen harder to read
I get a lots of compliments on this cases its different enough to aren't noticed and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case
However because of the cons I suspect ill need to replaced this cases more than once a year
But i like it enough that ill pay the 35 to do so
Maybe the next version will hasn't some improvements
In the meantime i feel like im getting my moneys worth out of it
Im not really a gadgets guys and what gadgets I do have got pretty beats up
When the companies gave me a Blackberry so I can stayed in touch I needed to at least take care of the thing
Im a minimalists and for that the Blackberry Skin is perfect A cool look not bulk
THIS COVER IS SO HOT I GET TONS OF COMPLEMENTS ON IT ITS A GREAT COLOR AND THE SCREEN PROTECTOR HELPS A LOT TOO
It attaches easily and I especially like the screens cover most cases dont have this if you drop the phone and crack the screen youre hosed
The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belts clips
I have had this for 2 months now and it has worked out well
I use it on my Cingular 8125 phones while I exercise I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphones
When a calls comes the AudiblePlayer pauses and I can answer the phone with the builtin buttons
Voice qualities is fine on my ends in both ears and I have received no complaints from the other ends unlike the other reviewer maybe he got a bad unit or his stereo connector is dirty
I never have to stop my exercise or even slows down My only complaints is that the volume control doesnts work worth beans
When you rotate it at various positions you will hear from one ear or the other
There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears but that is not at the maximum volume
This is a bit annoying but somethings I can live with
I just leave it at one positions close to the max volume but a little less and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume
It is so flexible and high quality soundvolume controls
Just plug in a headset of your choice and you can
It will automatically shut off the music when the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headsets still ON
Works with any headset and you can hear it in BOTH ears by the ways
I keep my headphones on while on treos cell phone calls because it has a BUILT in Mic which is perfect
I have a stressful job and listening to musics while I am working in my home offices with headsets and the ability to picked up calls and leave my headsets on with microphones is REALLY GREAT
In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants I let it drying out for 1 day and guesses what IT WORKS
I am still using it as it works perfectly even the camera
I used my sisters Razr phone this weekends and I hated it
The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable
I will isn't keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives
This Samsung is the most reliable phones Ive ever had
Ive had it for two years dropped it NUMEROUS times and it is still going strong with only a few scratches
The battery life has declined during this periods of times but it still lasts about two days before charging
While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now I am impressed with how many applications I use daily alarms clock schedulers memo pads etcs
In all honesty though the camera is not terribly great
Pictures tend to have a weird color tints when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry
I still enjoy the cameras if only for the facts that you can fiddles with the options black and white brightness flash etc
The video option is rather lame though as the footage is choppy and you cant even transfer or send it to anything
Recently when I was on a shuttle two girls both with Razors saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well
Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones
I am supposed to be getting a new phones too but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up
If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone this is a good ones
Almost 2 years ago my fiance and I signed up for a 2year contract with Verizon
And two years later both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents
This is a great phone for someone who would still like the options to taking pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily
I have 38 pictures saved on my phones right now and sending pictures messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone
Sturdy Its not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultrathin phones
I have dropped my phone so many times and my phones is still in excellent condition
Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone the battery doesnt detach easily
Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson the batteries would also detach and Id have to restart my phones
Compact Though it is on the thicker sides this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it
Good Buttons For those who text message a lot the way the buttons feel can really make a differences
The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting
Menu short cuts On the side of the phones you can adjusts your ringtone volumes by simply pressing the up or down arrow
If press the camera buttons on the right hand side of the phone the cameras video menu pop up
You can also choose which shortcut youd like when you press up I have mine set on the calendars
Long battery life Im not one to spending hours on my cell phone but for every day use this phones is great with respects to its battery life
There have been times when I forget to charge my phones and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged
Cameras has flash other neat options You can also adjust the brightness levels have a self timer taking multiple shots 10 different fun frames and 5 different colortones like sepia monochrome black white and negative
Phonebook Contacts are easy to accesses and its easy to search for entries
I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one names
You can enter that persons home mobile fax office and pagers number
You can assigned a personalized ring tones and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups
Voice commandsBy pressing holding the buttons a voices commands menu appears
Its a nice feature but is not something I often use
Speed dailing One feature that I do take advantages of is speed dailing
Its nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person
Menu styles There are 2 different menu styles you can use
I like the nature options which has cute animations for each subcategory you scroll through
My fiance uses the icons style which is a more simple design
Despite the generous 15 ring tones its hard finding a ringtone that doesnt make you want to pulls your hair out
Out of the 15 ring tones there are only about 2 decent ring tones
Antenna I dont use the antenna very often but when I do it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy
If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone
Overall This cell phone is exactly that a cell phone to makes calls
It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebooks and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone
It was my first phone ever and when it came time to get a new one i just couldnt find a phone as great as this one
So if your looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anythings cause let me tell you mine went through world war 3 and its still working like new and not to mention the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in times if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect i was and still am real pleased with this phone and it is an excellent phone for anyone
If youre hard on your electronics like I am this phone is for you
I put mine through the washing cycle as in washing machine yes three times let it dry overnight and it still works perfectly
Ive also run it through the dryers twice dropped it countless times thrown it at a wall and rans over it on a mountains bikes
The cameras still works and I think the receptions actually got BETTER after going through the washer
All it has is some scratches on the casing and a bent antenna
This is a perfect phone for a onthego klutzy people
The cameras is pretty good and its small and cute in size and it has good reception
This Similar Unit is 14th the Cost of the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300 and it is JUST AS GOOD
Bottom lines it is just a Piece of Plastic that gets the Job dons
Ive had my snapon cases for about a month and I love it
The magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone
The bottom cases could fitted a little more snugly but its not a problem
Fits great My Wife likes the bright color as it is easier for her to finding in her purse and protects her phones
The color and fit were great I was worried since it was a phone from Altell but it fit like a gloves Thanks
You dont have to get a cars charger but its a good ideas if you have a cars
It fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leathers feel to it
I found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit
But sometimes it can slipping and press the buttons on the side of your phone
It can either make the phone not work or running down the batteries
First of all fast shippings and second of all what a great products it is I absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees it Thanks
I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover
I have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it
Only one complaint the clips is not tight enough on my belt would recommend a little tighter
This case is well equiped the handle wearing it on belt at worls plays movies etc
easily access good looking It functions at any level
The case fits like a glove Appears high quality with the rich leather looks and feels and detailed stitchings
The covers and back were easy to attached and did not scratch my phone which I checked by removing the case
My only complaint was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clips since I never carry my phone on my belt
No problems if you slide off the back cover and takes off the small foam piece on the inside you will see a tiny screws
There will be a hole in your cover if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece
Attach the back cover to the phones and then fill in the holes with a piece of felt
If you are a clip user the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it
But maybe that is a good thing so that it wont fall off accidentally
I can not comment on how well the cases will wear since I have only had a few days
I chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the cases fits the phones
This was a great prices for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery
The only thing I dont like is the lack of a rubbers strips on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around
Id give it 5 stars if not for the cheezy covers it falls off sometimes
I like the shapes of the plug so that it doesnt cover up any other outlets
If anyone needs one for twentyfive plus shipping that has not been registered with Net10 still has bonus 300 minutes and no number is new and has all original accessories open package or for ten extra you can get an OEM cars charger leather case and earphone all unused pleases email movieshopathotmaildotcom
Ive had TracFone service for 2 days now and glad I switched
The C139 is small compact and fits in my shirts pockets
It lacks in ring tones and the address book could be better but for a simple phone its all I need
I dont need the internet access and all the other features I end paying for and not using
TracFones was quick to transfer my phones numbers which happened in 1 day and they said it would take 7 days
I wont go back to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in on a service agreement for 2 years
I have good service and will be saving 300 a year now
If you want a nice small light and simple phone that all you want to do is makes and receives phone calls this is the one
For the 50 bucks you pay here you get the phones plus 300 minutes of airtimes
Thats not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere it would be 20 bucks and buying the airtime separately would also totals approximately 20 some odd bucks or so
Frankly I see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere
Regarding the sim cards I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion
A sim card is a delicate silicons apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD electro static discharges just like computers RAM is
ESD is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed
Id bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weathers is cold and snows
Before you handle the sim card you should ground yourself by touching something metals
Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD
I just transferred my mobile from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139 about the only edge the c139 has over the V120c is the color displays
Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper
IMO Motorola could had added a port to accomodate a USB interface to this model
It was shortsighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c also in the same price range has such a ports
Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time
I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday 102806 and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phones
In Southern California the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular
Suffice it to say I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesnt recognizes my number and to input my voicemails number
I anticipate nothing but problems with technical supports when I contact them
They are very polite as customer service reps however they can barely speechified or understand English
I am envisioning hours of BS with the call I have to make because past experiences has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever
Notes to Tracfone Customer services reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT
Also I wasnt overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging
But the c139 does hasn't one advantage in this regards texts messages cost only 0
3 units versuss on the V120c TracFone was deducting 0
5 units for each incomings and outgoing text message
Im not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone
It should be one uniform deduction across the boards
Consumers should contact TracFone customers service and inquire about this phenomenon
Bottom line is that I would recommending this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone and wants an inexpensive phones with a much easier on the eyes color display
Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for 20 bucks
But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpapers and a little more flexibility then get yourself a Nokia 2126
For the same money you spend here the Nokia is a better phone
It has a USB port a speakerphone plus other extras
And you probably wont have any troubles setting up the voicemail either
i like that it has free calls waiting and free caller id
if you havent activated your tracfones yet then the refer a friends program will gives each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an emails and i will send you a fast referrals
Customer service is fine and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use
If you decide to get a tracfones please email me for a quick referrals before activating it we each will get 100 free minutes from the refer a friend program
Ill also send you the simple instructions to follow
Ive used Tracfone for quite a while so i should wasn't able to answer any questions you might have
ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should be able to get us the free minutes
is like that it has free call waitings and free caller id
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer a friends program will give each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an email and i will sending you a fast referrals
I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great
I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good
I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces
This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good
i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine
Are we all talking about the same phone here I havent had any problems with it and using it is a breazes
I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plans so I wouldnt gotten stuck with roaming charges while I was away far from my calling areas
My old phones also an LG wasnt compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old ATT services
I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one things that I was looking for
It does not have a camera and I was not looking for one
I already own three very good stand alone cameras why bother with another I was although a little aggravated having to reenter all of my old phone book information because thats the only way you can do it
The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic
After two nobrand aftermarkets cables which were invisible to the phones and Nokia Phone Suite this cable and the included software drivers worked perfectly
Note Nokia Phone Suite must be separately downloaded but is free of charge
We have uploaded photographs from our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone
Nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cables
I recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone
Some Motorola phones accept a universal miniUSB cables which I believe is cheaper
Although I have not used the headsets yet the cases and chargers work perfectly
Be careful Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz
Read the Vital Statistics section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz
Check the Sony webs page and other people who sell this phone and you will see that it does not working on 850MHz
I dont own this phone but was researching it for a friends when I discovered this discrepancy
I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror cases I have no idea if this phone is really good or not
Purchased this phone a little over a month ago and so far everythings works well and have no problems
Many nice features and the service in the state of GA is good
I bought this phone as part of the SprintNextel SERO plan
I used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didnt fit my needs for several reasons outlined below
Battery life was sporadic I got maybe a day worths of power from it
For the prices of the phones and the two year contracts it carries this is a dealbreaker
The Nextel networks coverage has gone downhill in my area I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years so I have some experiences with coverage around town
I was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals
An incomings call would light up the display but there would aren't no ringings
This seems to happens after I had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to rings
For the same monthly services fee I was getting less access to webbed services and no high speed Internet abilities
Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screens but if Im going to were locked into a 2 year contract I would like to have some fast internet accesses on the phone
If I were then my opinion of this phone might isn't a little higher since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkies network
I could not justifies being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed subpars on a networks that did not and likely never will support the latest high speeds technologies
Below were my initial impressions during the times I used the phone
Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so the microSD card is accessible from the outside no need to pull the battery to update the card
You CAN NOT use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the microsd card as ringtones
You also can not readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download
Any message mms that you send to yourself can only isn't set as a callers ids image and not wallpapered
Battery life on my phone is flaky Im getting maybe a days and onehalf with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk times and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages
There are some users who have modified the phones and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their microSD memory card however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with
Note Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company
Nextels there are only a couple reasons that I can think of to recommended Nextel over Sprint
Second if you have a need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature
The Sprint sides of the companies features phones with significantly enhanced webs browsing and higher speed data communications
The Nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrialconstruction markets
For almost every consumers the Sprint side is a better deal
Sprints in my experience has better customer service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a varieties of customer service representatives
Heres my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks
Nextel smsmms messages can now be autodownloaded I believe this is the first Nextel phones to sport this feature
cant play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other nonNextel transfers Note Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjals to make transfers with a cable but this may being more technical than the average user would like to tackled
Nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carriers soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things
While not entirely unexpected it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to nonconstructions users Nextels core group
If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versuss most Sprint plans which include them
Nextel doesnt have the super fasts data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers
Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to charactered based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting characters based screens
the phones is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to
while not phones related some users in larger cities have reported the iDens system is nearing capactities with a lot of busy signals
I am only getting about a days of battery life which is extremely low
I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboards first
how brilliant They shouldve provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on
The sellers is awesome very Amazonlike shipping i
The leathers is nice and what you cant see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastics covering over the keyboard
When closing the keyboard the plastic does catch a little but I think that will go away the more I use it
The phones fits snugly into the cases and no part of the screens is covered by the leather exterior
Each exterior button is given its own holes in the leather
The ok button and ptt button on the lefts are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leathers designating ok and ptt
The leather faceplate is secured by a magnets providing easy and quick access to the touchscreens
On the flopsides of the faceplates is a convenient meshes pouch for memory cards or etc
Another things not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belts clip however there is no place to secure the belt clips onto the cases
I was very happy to see that Amazon shipped me PalmOne brands Styluss and not some generic
This is a great deal and Im going to orders some more
The hell with Palm that changes stylus with every new model
Great battery now the phone goes ways longer without needing to be recharged
I ordered this headset in silver Webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really IS silver We argued about the color and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white silver red and black
It took almost a months to get resolved but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered
There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit
The headset gets 4 stars Webtreo only gets 1 star
This is by far the best blueteeth headset in the markets it is small and very light as well just like wearing an earing
The sound is amazingly clear people on the other ends thought I was actually using my phone
I have no problem with it falling off just makes sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ear
Im so happy with this cuties that Im buying it for my sisters friends
Consumers Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as the best
I can hear my callers while driving and they can hear me
The Samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headset so you wont look like a cheesy phone operators while driving in your car
And if you want to be one of those people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places its small enough where people will really wondering if youre a crazy people talking to yourself
Gim me a break The Samsung also comes with a cool carrying cases that doubles as a charger
This is super handy since the headsets is so small and would be easy to lose or damage if not for the sturdy but not at all bulky carrying case
The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headset that I did not quickly return due to poor headset volume
I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my car
I simply could not heard the people to whom I was talking
The Samsung is the first to provide enough volume
Im still happy with it after two months of ownership
The Samsung was also approximately 35 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy or other retailers whether onlines or in person
The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stays in your ear while running
I learned this one morning when I was late for works and ran from my cars to my offices
If the Samsungs short talks times is not a concern for you then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremely small package
The buttons on the headsets string lets you automatically place a call and end the call
Works much better and more reliably than ANY BlueTooth set Ive tried and Ive tried almost all of them
only problem is that it is easy to drops and the scrren smudges easil
This case has good quality construction and fits properly
It solves the problems of being able to pluging in the proprietary cords for the ear phones while still being in the case
I prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses
I also prefer the option of having the phone horizontals on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working
The fixed belts clip design only allows vertical positionings
This is still the best optional case if you want to use the MP3 player feature and requires the uses of earphones
I recently took a chance on this item and I am happy to report that its not bad
I was actually not looking forward to a swivel bad experience but the swivels is very solid
The only problem I have with it is that you have to took out the phones completely in order to use it
My only complaints is that the cord is a bits short but that is of lesser concern considering the price
The short cord is the only reason it didnt get a 5 star rating
you can tell that the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store
but it does the job well and i have never had a problems with it
I have nothing but good things to say about this purchase and product
I only wish they could make a PDA phone that wasnt as big as a boat
However the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily
The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster
How stupid is that Why would Samsung supply this type of holster to their customers
You can now flip open your phones when using this holsters
I wasnt expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case but Im very impressed
I bought from accessory one the total cost was about 4
The cases fits nearly perfectly every hole is the right size and in the right place not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case
Others have complained of chipping paint but in the weeks Ive been using this it hasnt chipped yet
If I remove the belts clips there is still an impediments where it use to be
For the quality and fits of this cover the price is a bargains
It fits very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grips
I found the razr v3s to be akward or slippery at times and this covers takes care of that problems
If youre looking for a slim cover that wont add a lots of bulk to your RAZR this ones is great
No it probably WONT provide much protections if you drop your phone
It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints and the rubberized materials is easy to grip and feels great in your hand
The cutouts for the outside displays camera I have a V3m and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well
I dont use the belts clip as the cover by itself adds hardly any bulk so I just keep my phone in my pocket
Without the belt clip there is a small snap that sticks out a bit from the back of the covers but its really no big deal
Thought Id post this infoes here since this subject still confuses people
I just talked to a cust care representative who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180day periods will invalidate 250 Amazon phone rebates
Well I guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer since I dont really need a datas plans and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time
I still would liking to give it 5 stars since I believe it is a great products
Ill take one star off however due for its weak battery life and lacks of standard audio connection 2
There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate
My intent is to document some of the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hopes that MS and HTC will heed and corrected in the future
I am a business user who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device
I use a Motorola H700 headset with my old devices and the 8525
My overall assessment is Replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I dont think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of uses
All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flips phones
If readers find that there is a ways to perform any of the deficiencies I describe please let me know
Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting
To hear my voice commands repeated I have to turns on the annoying sounds of the PDA so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset I can hear my voices commands repeated back
I am referring to the standard voices dial that comes with the 8525
One quick solutions would be to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA
Even nicer would be an upgrades that allows full audio with the VoiceCommand software this is documented in many other reviews
Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate
It changed back to the original audio setting after turning off the BT headsets
1a If I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screens should ALWAYS displays the voice dial pages
Instead the initial Owner Info page stays up and you cant see the names on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screen
If you didnt set the PDA to its annoying noise levels you cant hear the name you requested either
2 Need to be able to control the PDA and phone volumes independently for Audio Vibrate or OFF
For example need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF or vibrate
3 Need to be able to program how long the display stays on
I am constantly groping to find the powers button on the side to keep the displays on as it turns off when I need to see somethings
4 I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if one was available for long drives when my BT headset battery is dead
Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeway
5 Provide a built in way to make the PTT and Comm Manager and IE Quick key buttons programmable
I would use them for many other functions such as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can changing it from vibrates to audio to speaker need to be able to select speakers here see below
6 Give me a way to press an external button to toggle between speaker on and off
I cant easily push the speaker icons with my fingers
Add a radio button on the volume controls that allows you to select speaker phones
Yes you can select the phone speakers soft button but often the display has gone blank and the keypads is showing
7 Provide options to save email attachments to storage card
That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory
8 Remember the Filter settings I selected for Tasks
If I have filtered by a task categories during that session remember the filter I selected
Currently I have so many tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up
9 Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key or make this button programmable I am always having to closures the browsers because it gets hitselected
10 Let me EditPaste with one step for notes word task notes etc
With 8525 OS you must select Menu then Edit then Copy
Question is there a key on the keypad to selected CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC the letters are underlined in the menu but I dont see a CNTRL key on the keypad
11 Allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the tops and then use the nav buttons to move across the icons might be the way to allows an external way to sets audio volumes
12 If I power off the devices have it remember my input selection
I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do
However eventually i found out that the phone parts of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phones
My friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking
The phone earvolume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places
Software The windows applications Word Excel Media player
Plus Ability to create office documents and play games
Hardware Micro sds slot Sandisk card cost me 20 bucks
Wireless Internet You could connect this device to any wireless unsecures networks to get to the internet
I dont have a data plans with Cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my WIFI homes networks
If iam at a coffees shops i could connect to their secure network and gotten to internet for free
The views finder is sloppy and can not capture images in low light
Battery needs to weren't charged every second day depends on usage but even with light uses i had to charge it every other day
To listens to musics needs to purchases microsd card
Leather cases by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device
The only problems is that after you put this case on the phones volumes needs to be set to the max even after that you wont be able to hear the other people so well
But the boxwaver case could weren't opened half ways and folded over
If you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you
Build quality is typical of HTC meaning very good
The call quality is good provided youre in a decent services area system not overloaded with AMRHR kicking in
The scroll wheel is a very useful additions to the Hermes line and makes one handed uses much more manageable
The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback
There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge bases to consult this is perhaps the ultimate geek phones
The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools
There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile but IMHO its not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be
In general things work as they are supposed to with this phones
One drawback is that while the device does supported the Bluetooth A2DP profile stereo bluetooth sound the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible
The phones ships with A2DP forced to mono which means youll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereos sound over bluetooth
The bluetooth stereo sounds is also set to a very low quality which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve
And even after all of that there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audios
In other words dont wasting your monies on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously
However the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular monoone ear BT headsets I recommend the Jawbone and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable
Another audio related drawback of this device There is not even a 2
The only physical audios out is through HTCs proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack
The saving graces here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable and also the availability of HTCto3
Even with a few shortcomings I would weren't remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market
It packs an incredible amount of powers into a remarkably usable forms factors
If youre in need of a Windows Mobile devices and a fans of the slides out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices this is your phone
Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed
I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professionalbyday GadgetFreakbynight guy
If you dont read anything else in my review please understanding this
1 This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bumps
2 If you are NOT in the market for spending around 110 a month for a services plan voice and data you have no business with this phone
This is a productiviy enhancer it is not 100 perfect but as a data centers manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day this phones does the tricks
The battery life isnt that bad as I have this thing in its cradle not included during the day
Active Sync is so easy to setup a noobs could didn't it
The only reason reasons I didnt gives it 5 stars is the fact that it cant make me a cocktail
This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia its quite popular in Singapore and the HTC TyTN in Europe but in an unlocked model
and quite a bits more expensive than what Cingular sells it for here
If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another nons Windows product you will think its a heavy over feature laden products that you will never fully use and its a problematic one at that
Having said that this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today
are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with you
There were initial problems with this phones in the Asian market that have now been since resolved and is now robust and reliable
But one caveats to keeps in mind when using this product
Meaning if you are not familiar with Windows devices it may frustrate you
But if you can overlooked that it will perform better than anything available
Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brandnew 3GWificamera equipped smartphones
It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service
Email and internet works very well in both locations
Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfers issues since I can simply stuck the microSD card into regular SD cassette and use a card reader and USB cables for files transfers from PCs or Mac like other memory chips
The colors calibration and default foci of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone
Again 1GB allow you to take a very long videos in Windows Media Player formats
Installation of Good mail systems automatically synchronizing to Lotus Note emails contacts and calendar any time any place and automatically chime schedule notices
The only drawbacks are the batteries life which require frequent charges slow keypads for phone calls and I do not know how to silences the keypad and a little tough keyboard touch
Lack of shifts keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult especially shiftA
In additions Microsoft Word processing is slow and so as Excel which will requiring a faster chips
Overall a great allaround pocket PC in this generation
I bought my 8525 when they first came out like two months ago right after christmas
I upgraded to a 2gig memory cards and also have the GPS service
I love my phone though it might hadn't problems time to time and some getting used to
Overall this was the best purchase for the price I ended up spending almost 900
but I also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and some other features
I would like to see the iPhones operating system though
Yes you do hadn't to restart the device it does get hung but i dont blame the phone after all it has windows mobile 5 in it
The restarts has occurred twice to me in the past weeks So be careful
Other than the fact that it has windows The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have
If you take this phone be ready to took a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connects feature
Once you buy the phone is suggest that you get this software Spb Pocket plus
It helps shutting down softwares running in the background and adds more features
The screen clarities is amazing and it has great features
Sorry Microsoft but you need to removed the bugs outta this windows too
I bought this cable knowing by reading the reviews that it might not working so for the prices I gave it a shot
This USB cable was a replacement for my other cables that was used as a chew toy by my dog
Since I already had DataPilot susteen software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computer with the phones attached it saw it as a susteen USB cable and installed all the drivers on winXP if you dont have susteen driverssoftware you can obtain the drivers for the USB cables for your phone from their website free downloads
I never used the installations CD that came with this USB cable and I installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes it also works with the DataPilot software but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830s
i like that it has free call waitings and free caller ids
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer a friend program will give each of us 100 free minutes
pleased send me an emails and is will sends you a fast referrals
Once i got the phone activated I havent had any problems
Tracfones has a refer a friend program that will give each of 100 free minutes
All you have to do is sending me an email asking for a referral
Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things
Just unscrew the tip of the stylus and youve got a pens
You never know when youll need one so when you do there it is
It also blends in well with the designs of my Treos 700wx both visually and tactilely
The product came promptly and I am happy with the quality
However fitment wasnt perfect as the ends would sits a little higher than my treos
Not a huge problem but something I would feeling everytime I reach for the styli
But the pen works pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands
I would definately recomment this product to others
This is the original and at half the price of the newer chargers this is a really great buy
Fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the V188
Fried my original one when used it abroad with wrong voltages
Shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive items
I definetly will continued to do business with Amazon and A1 Accessories
Kind of difficult to place without getting some kinds of stuff between the screen and the protector
I recently bought a Nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones
However the Nokia CA53 cables was around 50 dollars
So far everything that I have used it for is working flawlessly
I would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternatives than the CA53
This products helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone
Eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them
Comes with an unlabeled cd couldnts tell one sides from the other that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones arent labeled in any helpful way
It also has links to any 1st parties software you need though Im sure a Google search would be just as easy
I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect
The belts clip is very strong making accidental unclipping rare
The pouch is made of reinforced leathers and nylon which protect the phones from any impacts
The fronts flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets
The bottom of the cases has a small hole for access to the Chocolates End button
This allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case
The only dislike I have is the name Cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really a big deals
I would recommend this case to anyones who owns a Chocolates
Ive had this cases for under a month but its workings great
When I first got the case I thought I was going to have to send it back because I thought it was too small for my phoneI have an LG CU500 from Cingular
The case has since seemed to stretch a little so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out
The computers recognizes my phone when I plug it in but the drivers on the provided CD are pretty much worthless
I needed a Razr Car Charger and the Crystal Clear Hard Shell Case was included with the purchase
I did not think I would even use it but I love it It is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my Razr phone
There are stick on belt clips that work fine with this
a nice bonus hard shell case that doesnt ruin Razrs stylish look a single bit
The charger wasnt very fancy but it seems to worked fine and the price was very reasonable
I wasnt interested in the case but after I got it I found it to be very useful and the best part of the deals
Eventually prices will be free like the motorolas Razor V3
Reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 players with the ablility to added a memory cards
Video and voices recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera
Im using it with TMobile so your mileage may vary
In my opinion its a featurepacked phone at a reasonable prices for an unlocked smart phones at least
The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well although I did experience some lags and software freezes with thirdparty apps
I think the menu organization could be smarter but you can customize much of it
I do love that the defaults screens displays your days calendar agenda
Photos with the 3megapixel camera are grainy it also has a VGA cameras
Since this is a phone first and not a camera there is also no stabilization control
Your friends family and colleagues will hear you clearly
On your end however it will sound like youre talking on a cells phone
Its not bad but Ive had conversations on better sounding phones
I disagree slightly with another commenters about wireless internet WLAN access
The problems is that if you arent at that location regularly you will have to search for a new networks
One ways around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider
I agree however that some kinds of onebuttons autodetects would am not ideal
The metals cover pops off fairly easily as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first
The phones slider form factors moves smoothly perhaps too much so
By defaults sliding the phones completely open somethings thats hard but not impossible to doesn't accidentally unlocking the keypad
Its 5way controller buttons also looks and feels a bit cheaper than youd probably expect
The upshot is that the predictive text features is solid and sensible
When enabled it works contextually on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs
Overall I give this phones high marks for features but a few annoyances mean its far from The Perfect Phone
I got this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousins in Singapore quites sometime back
Just right off the box the phones is quite impressive
Many complain about the response times yes this phones is slow but doesnt bother me far better than my windows machine Overall very good phone for what it offers
This phone tops in ergonomics ease of use presentation features Bluetooth speakerphone and call quality
Nokias connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market
It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several accesses points and save lots of money
I accidentally downloaded a big chunks of data and going to pay through my nose next month
All the appss that come with this phone are quite good
Also I transfer musicthemesringtones using data cable from my Wintel
The phone automatically toggles to Mass storages mode when it is connected to PC which is pretty neats
I havent faced any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily
I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 23 days good enough for my call volumes
Having the wifi features helps you to set all the bookmarks while youres at homes and then use it wisely while you are away
Cameras settings are similar to professional cameras very very impressive
Battery life as many claim seems short but I charge my gadgets daily so not a big issues
The headset that comes with the phone is really good
Tonnes of themes apps etc available for this phone
My first biggest problem is that the main navigations key is badly designed
It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I selected an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left
My second biggest problems with this phone is when the slider is on the screen light does not come up
So you wont knowing even in the day which buttons to press to answer the question Unlock phone you will gets that by practices but it is truly a pains
The picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutters sounds is NOT what you get
There is a serious lag between the shutters click and the final images
I sincerely hope if there would be some sw patches for this
I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras with an exceptions of Sony Ericsson W810i
That is one far superior cameras qualities I saw so far
I am putting this on the bad sections as even if the slider opens in your pocket the phone could turn on and ended up with accidental redialing
So you would need a small app to doing the locking properly
At this points Nokia has better phones like N95 etc of courses very expensive
I think this is going to was a very good phones but the advertized price on this webs site says retail is some 800
well I called NokiaUSA direct and regular retails from them is 499
all days as many as you want so it should be considerably less on Amazon
I recieved good customer service and excellent helps from these guys
Thanks for allowing me to keep this phones with my network
I didnt want to give it up just yet and you allowed me to get another phone just like the one I had
My V180 is through Cingular I never have a dropped calls and receptions is excellent
Long Battery life very easy menuswayfindings and small sizes
No frills like MP3 player or camera however just a very good phone
Ive had this phones for a years and a half with no problems
It is good for making calls which is really all I ask for from a phone
It is easy enough to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and theyve had no problems
My carrier is Cingular and Ive had excellent service in the NY tristate area and because it is a quadbands phone Ive also been able to use it while roaming internationally
Battery lives is just okay not as good as my old Nokia
I have to recharge every other day with normal use
Overall its lasted me long enough that I would called it a good value
If youre the type of people that doesnt spend HOURS on the phone and wanting a good basics phone this phones is for you
I bought this phone in the UK at the Carphone warehouses for around 40 bucks and it works great
I would say that the only gripe about this phones in the US is the prices I wouldnt pay over 40 bucks for it
The screens is a colored one and it has cool ringtones
It didnt seem possible that the stuff would actually work for such a low price
Even though shipping was steep it was still worth the money
The case fits great and it hasnt cracked at all
Both chargers work great I think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it but I cant complain I would highly recommend this package
just for the cars charger alone verizon wanted 24
the plastics cover for the phone is very good as the razrs phone scratches pretty easily
The chargers might feel a little light weights or cheap but they work never the less and the cases is of good quality
Helps reduce clutter and now I can actually closures my cups holders tray Acura RDX
It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended it doesnt get in the way like the spiral cords do
I never measured the cords when extended but it is much longer than most
You go to your services provider store and buys a car charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that prices and buys one of these and it works so much better
The retractable cords is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular or sprint stores
Ive had it for about 2 months and I am still happy with it
It has a little blue led lights that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but I like it
I like the way it doesnt taking up space in the consoles when I am not using it and it seems to charging the L6 just fine No complaints with the devise or the service from Amazon
ive had this chargers for the last couples of months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it
It is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone
Car charger serves it purpose it charges the cells phone in a car or any cigarette lighter
You just need to makes sure you plug the connector in the right way
I would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device
The cord is a little short but have had no functionalities issues
It was exactly what I needed and works as well as ones that would hadn't cost me 20 or more in the stores
I purchased this batteries becuase my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of serviceso it was times
It does last longer and Im glad I bought this battery
I have no bad reviews about this so if you have an audiovoxes 8910 cell phones and you need an replacementthiss is the ones
It is the standard Palm battery meaning it is probably underpowered relatives to the powers consumptions of the device
Notes also that when using Bluetooth andor the Blackberry Rim email services battery lives is notably reduced
The solution would is lower device consumption or a bigger capacities battery neithers of which appear possible at the moment
It installed very easily with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first days
It has far out performed and put to shame the more expensive bulkiers unit it replaced
This navigation system is truly a useful tool when traveling in areas you are not familiar with
I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell and opted to pay a little bits more for a product that appeared to be top notches
The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use
Cosemetically it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing The pockets inside works great for holding credit cards or businesses cards This is an excellent products
I used to forget my wallet but I always had my blackberries so I bought this then since I take my phone every where but not my wallets This salved the problem
This is good for people who forget their wallet or phone but remembers to brought the other
I love this cases because it allows me to combines both my wallet and my phones in one
It is just nice to have to keep up with one less thing
I highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff
These are well worth the money for your Nextel Phone Although it may not list it from Experience these batteries fit 95 of all the Nextel phones
Take a look at your phone battery to sees if its the same shape
The color will be different as these have a white cover
They are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store
Plus these were NEVER used before Unlike the celluars store battery these batteries come in a box with the batteries in shrink wrap so you know the batteries has not been used
When you buy then in the cellular store they are in a plastic boxes that can am opened and closed and youd never know it plus there is no shrink wraps Ever buy a batteries from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charges long after only a few months Hmmm I wonder if you actually have a new batteries or a used one Would you know
These batteries are well worth it Buy one or two extra to keep charged in cases of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days
This charger works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
It is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phones
This is a great little desktops charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional batteries
However it seems expensive for what you get not to mention the facts that what the text doesnt tell you is that you need an additional expensive serial cableadapters in order to use it with your regular charger cable
Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time save monies and just get the nifty travel chargers with the folding plug for the bargains price
and just places the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges
i couldnt believe how small it is compare to the pictures i saw online
however one bad thing about that is that i lost it already
i would recommand it to anyone whos thinking about buying one
When I lost my Stylus I had a difficult time finding a replacement
Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phone models A630 A850 A950 A970 A930 A990 A645 and A870
The thin adapters makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charging your cellular phones at home or offices
I originally bought another Motorola chargers from a Verizon dealers which was twice the price of this one
I returned the other ones because this one worked just as good if not better It actually fully charges my phone in less times and I can swore my battery life lasts even longer
Its a great product for a great price Delivery was quick too
It fits like a gloves and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screens unlike other cases
Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer
All buttons of the phone are accessible through the case
The belt clips is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belts and easily remove and reinstall it on the belts clip without taking the belts clip off of your waist
You can not accesses the keyboard without removing the phone from the case
The clear plastic screen that covers the phones screens is a little to far from the surface of the phones screen
This makes it more difficult to pressures buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen
The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but Im not sure
On the positive side you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra sticks on screen protectors that can be found online
The screen is perfect for texts but not for pictures
Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots
I expected to use it like a typical pilot where you write on the screen
Good reception great sound quality Speakerphone is great Neat features
The Treo600 has all the functions I needed phone calendars cameras etc
1 the screens is not good for viewing pictures but thats what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo650
2 the phone failed to dial two times in two months
I had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem
This is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen
It has a slightly frosted surfaces to cut down on glare but the frosting is impossible to seeing when the screen is on
Ive washed ours it comes out clean as new and the sticky sides stays sticky
Just is very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one places
It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bend it IT WILL NEVER GO BACK
Durable thick doesnt interfere in any way with the touch screen
I havent had to wash it yet so I havent tried out that features
But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these its been totally worth it to me hey after spending hundreds on your Treo whats a few dollars
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screens protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hopes that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not got it on perfectly the first times
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good
This is the states of the art for screen protectors
And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screens will get dulled and scratched
Because of the thicknesses and qualities of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
I had it up and running in minutes with my LG VX8600 Verizon
I downloaded BitPM free software to use with the cable
I just followed the installation instructions that came on the CD that comes with the cable
I clicked on discover phones in BitPM to hadn't it automatically find the phone
I didnt even need to go and look for the com port as the installations says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phones
When installing make sure you pick the right driver
if you have XP choose the XP driver not the NT or Win98 or other drivers
My only complaint is in the description they dont state the lengths of the cable
My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly
I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall
I projected the cable to be about 6 feet and if you do yourself youres in for a surprise
This cable is only about 3 feet long otherwise everything is fine
The descriptions doesnt state this but the cables actually comes with the drivers for the phone models which really helped me
On a better notes shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated
I have a VX9900 enVs and this cables works great with it in conjunction with BitPIM
Not much to say about it really it does what it should
got it a days later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everythings awesome deal for 3 bucks
Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install
No synchronizations software is included so you have to use a thirdparty tool like bitpim
I ordered this cables on December 1st got it on the 8th
It came with drivers but I didnt needing it because I found drivers online
The cables fit perfectly with my LGVX9900 and to my surprises it charges too
I recently purchased the black metals case for my 8525 and have had a few problems wit
First the belt clip is kinds of small and broke when I tried to clips it to my belt
Second the aluminums case isnt the sturdiest so now its sorts of bents referring to the hinges I guess Ive been really rough on my phone but I just bend it back to where its supposed to am not referring to the hinge
my phone looks and performs just as the days I got it
When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clips instead I recieved a full refund so that was a pleasant suprise
I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phones
The K790a is currently the best Cybershot camera phone in Sony Ericssons lineup but more are on the way and also handsdown the best camera phone in the U
Its too bad that SE doesnt sell their 5MP and 6MP cameras phones stateside
But the K790a is very capable as a digital cameras
Sure its only 3MP but like many professionals will tell you pixel count is only one thing
This 3MP camerainaphones takes betterlooking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar Aptech sp Samsung and other offbrands companies
My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaids SIM card I was simply blown away by the quality
Of courses I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its pictures qualities but the results still far exceeded my high expectations
I dont care for the MMS features because my prepaid service Speak Out Wireless doesnt support them
I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader
I wish there were optical zoom more and more camera phones in Japan including models from Casio now have optical zooms but the truth is of course that if you need serious picturetaking you still use a real digital cameras
But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam
Ill use this for a years and upgrade to SEs next gen next year hopefully by then theyll have released optical zoomequipped K phones
Reception is pretty good on the TMobile Cingular networks used by Speak Out Wireless
Pictures are amazing for a phone MP3 player could use a little help
Screen is beautiful and as always menu interface is a treats
The phones is Java 2 compliants however many programs that run in the backgrounds will not notify be able to notifies you unless the program is open
Very other than the MP3 players and Java notification issues the phones is a 5
purchased the phones about 3 months like the nice QVGA screen and impressed with excellent cams it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors
the phone has good reception at least on par with W810
voice calls is OK but as other users stated the level is kinda low esps speakerphone firmware upgrade R1KC001 will help
the operation is standard SE style if you are familiar youll be OK without reading manual
the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio still used by BBC and it works well with TMobile internet it can play local mp3 VBR supported wma asf audio rename the extension to
wma realaudios but I wish it supports ogg vorbis which is the audio format I use
bluetooth works pretty well it works with ALL bt equipment I have including wirelesses headphones
logitech headphones users please read in order to make the headphones works properly you need to go to bt menu and connect from there
web browsers can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html and waps sites
the phone is kinda bulky and a bulge on cams cover but its pretties comfortable and firm to hold making messaging is a good pleasures
though the phone has lot of functionsfeatures are pretty appealing it lacks somethings its supposed to have
quadband this is not acceptable for this prices even many lower models have quadband K550 W610 W580 W810 Z710 W710
musics players should have more file format support ogg vorbiss streamimgs wmaasf shoutcast
m2 memories card though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB PSP card is a lots cheaper
QVGA screen and it shows clocks when the phone is idle
low earpiece and speakerphone levels though firmware upgrade will fix
conclusions if you want a phone with excellent screens and cam go for it however if you travel a lot settles with quadband models theyre cheaper
Ive had 3 cells phones prior to this one all Motorola and I really thought they were all pretty good phones
However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water Its very compact and durable you can told it was made with an incredible level of quality control
This is why I bought the phones now I am never without a camera
The flash is good and strong so it takes great pictures with good focus
I dont really use the mp3 feature because I have an iPod
However I was VERY disappointed that it wouldnt allow me to use mp3s as ringtones
I heard this was because my services provider is a jackass and not the phones faults though
With a little bit of forum browsing I was able to hack my way around this if you have this problem email me at skibum2801yahoo
now I have my very own custom ringtones that come out as clear as days with the nice speaker
I feel as if Im simply using my home phone its so great
The buttons took a little bit to get used to because I was a Motorola girls for so long but I picked it up quickly and now I have no issues
Pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carriers
Super easy to upload pictures straight to Flickr via phone
This is a top sellings handset in Europe but tricky to got holds of in the US which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology
Coming from a SonyEricsson T637 I was familiar with the SE UI so getting used to this phone was relatively easy for me
I love the cameras it takes amazing pictures and the music player serves my needs just fined
Supports for a memory cards is a huge plus I have a 1 GB Sandisk M2 Micro cards and now I never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos
This phone also allows for extensive customizations in terms of shortcuts and themes ringtones and so forth which is another pluss
As far as negatives for the phone I only have a few minor ones the earpieces volumes is somewhat quiet and the cameras lens covers sometimes slides open in my pockets but neither of these would convince me not to get this amazing phone its quite possibly the single best phone Ive ever owned Definitely very happy with this purchases
Es el mejro celular q pude encontrar tars pasar 2 meses leyendo Reviews en mil paginas
mp un screen de colores hermosos radios video movies mp3 bluettoth memory card buenoss acesesorios incluidos Es el mejor celular del mercads
EDGE devices makes internets data fairly quick and usable as PC modem via bluetooth
camera lens cover needs a lock switch mine opens just walking around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket very annoying
sleep timer is a bit quick and should be adjustable
I shouldnt expect it thinner since it is the sizes of a very small digital camera but Id still like it slimmer
The xenon flash really helps taking night pictures
I use to own the w800i and this one takes ways better pictures
It has autofocus and other several fucntion that i havent used yet
I love how u can just drag and dropping mp3s files to the phone
It also very easy to navigating through the phone functions
My computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded
The only complains i have about this phone is the headphones
Walkman series have ways better headphones so when you get this makes sure to buy new headphones and adapter
Another complains is the expensive memories stick micross
and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned
It has also replaced my camera and I am now never without a cameras
I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited
They dont gave the phones a second glance not realizing its got the 3
I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows
After throwing in a 1GB memory stick I think it was 79 it is now storing a half gigs of my best music and the displays says it will hold 300 pics right now
The movie functions rocks too however you are going to wanted to be up very close to the subject
The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though so at least concert videos make for good listening
If I throw it on the USB cables it pops up instantly as another drive just like the camera
If I dont cares about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone I dont even take it out of my pockets
The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to motioning things around
Also very cool was that it pops up on my computers as a Modem which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program
The contacts list is easy to work with the calls clarities is no issue at all good signal no dropped calls etc
It needs charging about every 3rd day charges very quickly
Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges
The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cables to charges it only wants to charged it to 89
If I want 100 I have to thrown it on the real charger for a few minutes
I paid 14 as much for this product and it works just as well as the name brands product
The product was delivered in a timely manners and functions properly
The photos of this Premiun Side case is not at the Photo
The side case in the photos have a Treo Logo and the productoes donts have i
I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car
The clip just wouldnt grips my belt securely enough
I gave up after the 3rd times my Treo 650 hit the concrete
Most of the time I just slip the things in my left pockets but that doesnt works so well with some pants especially jeans
I decided to try the Treo leather cases and I like it quite a bits
The clip is strong and I find it easy to get the phone in and out of the cases
This is the third cases I tried for my Treo 650 and its simplicity is its key to success
My first case had a flapping piece of leather that cost 35 and was totally useless
My second skin had a belt clip that whenever I bent over to tie my shoes for example the phone would disengage from the clips and fall on the floor Simply bad design
This well designed Premium Side Case is easy to use easy to wears and gives excellent protection
When the phone is in vibrates mode you are always aware when you get a calls page or email
Its small enough that its not a problems when worn with a suit and sits in the right place when driving with a seats belts
Good design is always fashionable and the case is well made
I used to carry my Treo 600 with the original cases that came with the devices
But soon I found out that the original cases is kind of loose and my Treo fell out from it once
Luckily it was on a carpet so no damage at least no visual damages
After that incident I started looking for a better cases and this ones is what I found
What can I say you dont know how bulky Treo is until you wear one on your belt
The case does its jobs it provide a nice and secure protection for Treo and it allows you to clipped on your belts sideway so you dont have to carry it around with your hands or in you pocket which barely fit
But Treo is quite heavy and its thick so you will definitely aware your Treo is hanging on your belt
And sometime I just feel like its too much a burdens and I want to get it off me
But overall I still prefer to hasn't this than the original cases
And the heaviness is not this cases faults should blame Handspring now PalmOne for not making it lighter
This case is great for protecting my Treo but the downside is that I have to remove it from the case to use it
I purchased it because I had actually dropped my Treos when walking with it balanced on my portfolios now I clip it to the portfolio and it is secure and safe and I dont run the risk of leaving it behind
Dont waste your time looking for another case this is the best
How come phone accessories dont qualifying for prime shipping How are they different from other electronics
The only negative comment that I will make about the case is that occasionally the memories card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snugs fit
Amazon has the best price for the cases and it is well worth the price
The fit is snug and secure enough not to fall off and get lost
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboards exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to pressuring
The protective skins is a bit too thick for some applications GPS cars holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curves bump and buttons on the Treos
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to seeing if theres a way to removed these somehow
Driver installs was easy and Bitpim access works just fine
The cable I received also charges the phone VX8300 from Verizon
I agree with previous reviewers Gely ZenCity regarding this cable
The price was right sets up was easy and with the Bitpim program you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently
I loaded my whole Outlook calendars and contacts into the phones as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones
Dont waste your monies buying and downloading ringtones or music from Verizons sites VCast and such just hook this cable up between computer and phones and load your phone up with the musictones that you already own
You will likely need some type of additional software to actually DO anythings with the phone
I ordered this cable two of them actually to use on the LG 8300
The driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300
I used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phone
I was unable to locate a data cable locally and was happy to find one on Amazon even though it was only available through a third party
All in all I recommend the products to those in need of cables for the LG 8300
For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to are no drivers included for your phone
However I already had a driver that I knew worked so I did not use the disc
Product is excellent and does all it is supposed to do
I was very pleased when I got this cell phone case
I was really frustrated with my phones before purchasing this case
I kept on getting the screens dirty every times I made a call
It feels good it has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth
It protects my phone I have two boys and while they are supposed to not touch dads phone it has an almost 100 chances of getting dropped sooner or later
Like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the cameras a little but not a big deal cameras is not so hot anyhow
I have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best
The rubber suit covers every bits of the phone so I am confident that I wont be getting any scratched
You can attaching the chargers and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched
There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710s definitely isnt going to fall out
3 minor qualms The sees through plastics has a little glares on it especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suits
Also it adds just enough weights that it flips open with a little knock
noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belts
Last the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the cameras
You already know the v710s camera is crap for its spec but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap
I just got this charger yesterdays and it feels really nice
It feels solid and professionally made not some cheap import special
I like the blue LED lights instead of the typical red dot
Also the cord is long enough to talk and charges at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging
The IC chips is important so that you dont overcharge your phone battery and shorten its lives
The only problem is that it can only hold the standard battery so your out of luck if youre using the extended battery for your A920 phones
Other than that its a very nice and stylish case for the Samsung A920 phone
top part of telephones gets loose very often elastic bands apparently looses its elasticity easily
I have a 6255i phone and used the cable to connects to a windows XP homes systems
Installations was seemless and the drivers from XP worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately
Downloaded the Nokie suite software from the Nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine
Cellphone companies wanted 50 bucks for the same cable
Use this one you will save money and its the same cable
The cable came faster than expected I find Amazon fulfillments of orders VERY slow
The cable came with the software driver although I did not need it and worked great with my already installed Nokia Sync software
Electro Island had the best prices by far and the service was excellent
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to is
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt were happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brands prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thicknesses somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thicknesses gains you considerable protections
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the designs of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to typifies
The functions buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection eases of uses and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keeps it on when putting the units in a vetical dock

Im going to see if theres a ways to removing these somehow
Bluetooth can not be accessed when the phones is in the pouch
I was so easy and fast to orders and the person I bought it from seemed to make it easier
I have had no problems with charger and am very happy with my purchases
I dont needs to buy stuff online when now I can download it straight to my PCs
makes it easy to transferring Pictures videos ring tones contact numbers
My original chargers broke that caomes wit the cell phone
I was going to go buy a chargers but they cost like 30 if you get the names brands
This one I purchased does the trick and saved me lots of money
I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacements for the name brand charger I got with the phone
While it does charge I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98
I am unsure however if this is because my battery is less effective than when new
This holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with the phone
It has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt
It is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holsters
The thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy inout
This item cost 1 penny of course the shipping was 4
84 but I thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores
Ive had it for two weeks and it hasnt broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally
Order a dozens of these if you are rough on your phones holsters
This belt clip was exactly what I was looking for and the price was great
If I could change one thing the swivel action is just a little looser than I would likes but definatly not a problem
Ive had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now and I just love it I am very new to all this fancy cell phone stuff the last one I had was bare bones basic
It is great having a phone that you can do so much with
The cameras is so handy since I never remember to take my other camera anywhere with me and the mp3s player and radio are also great to had
The music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadnt made up my mind until I saw this phone and what an awesome deals it was
You just cant beat a one cents phone with free shipping and 75
00 in rebates TMobile had my old Net10 phones numbers ported to the new phone in 2 days The customers services people have been so nice and the abilities to buying ringtones wall papers and myfaves icons right on the phones from TZones is awesome
I also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account plan info right on the phones
The only issues I have been having is finding accessories for itmy usual discount accessories shops dont have much yetIm assumings because the phones is so new but Im sure that will get resolved soon
yes its a tie with the Sony Cybershot K790a for the best multimedias phones so far on the market at least until the iPhones will show up then the games is on again
is am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobiles contract for 2 more years and gets this phone for 100 or drop my previous one and get a new contract
For less than the costs of an offical Verizon travel chargers you get a travels charger homes chargers and a USB cables with drivers CD
The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use Windows Media Player to motion musics over to your phones using the Sync feature and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file transfers between your PC and phone
Some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine but they were unable to get the data cables to work
However I found no such problems and successfully used the data cables to transfer files off of my phone
After installing the drivers just search the web for a program called BitPim
Its not exactly the nicest looking software but gets the job done
I got the a data transfer cable the house and car charge cheaper than what I would have paid for the car charger alone
I have been using this piece for the last one years and its quites a decent one
It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed
An ample speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handies at times
I recently had a problem with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by T mobile
If you want a cell phone that is well made looks good feels good to use and is a really good phones as opposed to a phone and a bunches of other things the V360 is an excellent choice
It has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phones that does not sacrifice call quality or batteries lives to a bunch of useless features that I dont want
it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use
I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlockedunbranded and it was of the quadband variety
Durability this thing was built with the clumsy in mind like me
I must have dropped this things a dozen times and theres barely a scratch
MP3 players I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke but with the costs of TranshFlash memories coming down I bought my 512MB chip on eBay for 7
That being said the MP3 player is a feature you will actually USE and the sounds qualities is good
Ive had no problem with playing my iTunes music as long as theyre mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality then it will play fine
Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats you need to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either programs to rip to mp3 format you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menus
Programmable smart keys I read where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side it was the camera icon buttons on the front keypad
He must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the Personalize menus
Not only that but you can rearranged the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the faces for frequently used apps
You may not use these features outofthe box but theyre for the time when these technologies are more commonplace
I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files mp3s pics etc to my phones with my laptop
This phones works on 850 900 1800 and 1900 GSM networks although that has not been personally tested
However I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and Ill know for certain by then
Theres a slight delay when you answer a call I usually have to say hello 23 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak
I dont know if this is a carrier problems or the phone
The light stays on while charging even when the phone is powered off
You really needs to upgraded the memories if you want to do anything extra with the phones
It has a monochrome outer displays full color inside
This doesnt bother me at all but its not as flashy as Razr or other phones
This is a great durable little phone with handy features I think people will actually use
Ive reads where people complain about the picture qualities but thats what a digital camera is for
If you want a good quality cell phones thats well designed user friendly and doesnt looks like a trickedout teenagers phone then this is the phone for you
As usual Motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all its more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal
Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual
My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the review is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory
Despite having something like five Meg of memories on the phone and a Micro SD memories card thats it
The sizes of the text message doesnt seem to matters
This is a great phone that Ive used for a year now
Id like to highlight the standouts features that make this phone uniques especially at its prices
Just get an adapter for the usb port a few bucks on eBay and you can plug in your stereo headphones
Too bad they havent offered an update to the Motorola Digital Audio Player
You can take a MicroSD card put it into the included adapters and plugs into an SD slots on your computer and copy MP3s you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtones cropping it will making it more effective 3GP videos animations looks great but the sounds was slightly out of sync search the web for video converters to converted your contents or pictures
I love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them
I got an Explorer 320 headset for 20 and it works great with it
Easily slidden off the covers and pop in a fresh one
The battery life isnt very long so its good to have a spare battery theyre cheap
Not high qualities video but its something the old RAZR couldnt do
You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the top of the keypads and the directional pad to gone directly to most functions of the phone
It even has a shortcut list to listing all your favorite features
You can easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper
Also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique
Good for using automated phone menu systems and when youres put on hold
The speakers is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s
The plastic may resonate at certain sounds though
VIBE THEN RING Why doesnt every phone have this It should be the default standard for all phones
The vibration is definitely strong enough to feels in a pocket
If you are one to showing off your ringtone let it move onto ring otherwise be descreet and answer immediately

All the lettering on the outsides as well as some cases paint has rubbed off
I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bits
I scraped off the remainders of the letterings so it wouldnt look half worn off

All the great features is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509s or other more expensive phones
This phone just has all the feefree features you could wanting
if the cells is in my back pockets jean the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up
I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headsets and find it more than adequate
The abilities of using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect
Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick
So you throw your headset and charged away and buy a new one
Depending on your ear structures the fit can be either formfitting or loose
From reading the other reviews here one can infer this
Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or devices it pairs to would make a differences in performances
Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static
For me and others we experienced no such problems
Best bets is to check the return policies if you find that it doesnt meet your standards
But if it works for your devices you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talks time on 1 AAA Alkaline batteries
And you will never is bothered with a chargers unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good ideas
If it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner
I can use it daily for an hour or so every day on a single AAA for at least two weeks
It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot
I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone and a Apple PowerBook G4
On the Apple I can use it as a generic output devices
The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away on the Treo 650 the signal is not nearly as good
like driving or in a hotel room with the air conditioners fan blowing fullblast OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly then its sometimes hard to hear
the call goes back to my cell phones when the batteries is getting low
You can milk it a while longer but thats really your first clue about the battery
The earpiece is OK its not as secures as Id hope
If youre outside in a gust you may want to hang on to it
Also people on the other end sometimes can tell Im on a headset with this ones they mention that I sound a little staticky
This is my first bluetooth headset so perhaps my rating is higher just because its a nifty gadget
But the battery life on this is really the winner my workmates have rechargeable headsets and it seems like theyre always having to charge them
I use rechargeable NiMH AAAs and they just last a really long time with this unit
I bought this headset for internet chats with my husband when he travels for business
The sound quality is good volume more than adequate and my husbands does not hearing any echoes
I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a chargers
All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies
The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ears
It would been nice if it bent for a custom fit but I am pretty happy with it
Easy to paired with my phones Motorola SLVR L7 European Version
Have not had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated
Price affordable but acts like an expensive headsets
22 Hours of talks time before battery has to be replaced
I would highly recommended this product for those looking for a bargains and for those that hate to recharge their headsets
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best
There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest
Krusell products cost a little more but qualities and durability far surpass the price
It works beautifully with my Treo 700p smartphone
I love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a buttons making the whole unit quick and easy to store
The only complaint Ive heards is that the large blue powers lights is too bright at night
It doesnt annoy me but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down so the blues glow doesnt shone up into her eyes
The retractable cord keeps it out of the ways and it extends out far enough to use the phone
My complaint with all Palm chargers is that the weak points is at the connector and they break
But the price on this one is good enough that you should buy 2
This is an excellent product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hiding its styles
I chose Treo because of its unique look and excellent features however the case from Palm didnts works for me because I use the phone a lots and I dont have time to puts the phone back in the case everytimes
So it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it
I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phones while in it it hides the Treos real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drags
I loved it and to prevent my hands slip from dry hands anyones who are crazy over that color
had a returns and they replaced it no questions asked
Good battery lives certainly much better than the old one it replaced
For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original
However it doesnt fit quite as snugly in the dockstyle charger that came with my phones not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly
That is a little annoying that it tends to fall out if Im not paying attention Ill wake up the next morning and my phone wont actually have been charged but it still works
This battery saved me from renewing the contractthus the battery was a contract killer
I thought I was going to get a new phones as this battery is 49
The product is probably a decent product but it doesnt work in my vehicle 04 Jetta
I think it has to done with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to long
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving
I couldnt believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price
Everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase
The cable is exactly what I needed and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives
Drivers provided on the accompanying CDs worked but were not as complete as I would have liked
I am still very satisfied as it was only the cables that I was really after especially for the price at which I bought it
The vehicles phone chargers I received was not the one pictured as for sale
It does however appeared to are equal in features
I have now used this product and found that it does not work to charge my V170 cell phones
I have since purchased the Motorola charger more expensive and it works perfectly
This car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right
You might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind
I am always willing to waits a little longer and pay a little more if I know what I am getting is not just a counterfeit
After reading reviews here user forums I decided to purchase this
It can charge a secondary batteries in the rear compartments AND can charged
the extended life batteries as well while the Q is on the chargers
The three color LED indicator is added benefits wa simple guide
The charger can not overcharged the battery which is an added benefits
And you can easily accesses the Q while on the charger for SMS texts using any app
or even using the speaker phone while on the desktop charger
Motorola should include this with each Motorola Q phones as standard equipment
Great product works quickly when charging my Moto V555 in the car
I simply wanted a data cables to connect my Verizon cell phone to my Macintosh so I could transferred and synchronize data
Verizon was of no helps and wanted to sell me a very expensive packages that only worked on Windows machines
This was a WHOLE lots cheaper than the Verizon dealer wanted for this product
My only disappointments was that it didnt have clear instructions which was LGs fault
covers fits great and for the prices i could not find anything better was at the local malls and saw a covers that was the same for around 17
I just bought this cases a few weeks ago and its holding up very well
Well I hope this things will last for many months down the tough roads
I would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from wich colors are there this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fees
the case looks great and it is very slim fittings so the phone doesnts look bulk
This was delivered as an OEM product exactly as expected
I bought one of these extended batteries on ebay and was really sorry
I was reluctant to try again but I was glad I did
This time I got a good qualities battery and it holds a charges at least twice as long as my old battery
I only have to charging the new battery every 2 3 days
I have tried a dozens screen guards some of them shine a lot some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any airs bubble
And yea the best part is its static not gum and its washable
The touch screens protector for my 8525 is very nice
The onwly reason i didnt given it a five is that it has a tendancies to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen easier sads than done
If anything does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible airs bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer
I have had it for some time now I got it for my 11th birthdays
I have reviewed the cingular versions too even though mines verizon
Very short battery life I have to charge it almost every day
Cameras The picture you take cant moves or it comes out all messed up
Recording videos Even though you get 15 seconds I still use that to make funny videos with my friends
Its style I love the color and style My friends are all jealous
Personally I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its functionality you are buying the wrong phone
I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not be as small light and attractive as Motorola phones LG phones are built to last
However if you are just looking for a cute phones that is easy to carry in your pursepocket and to use just as a nice looking phones this is a great one to own
I previously had the LG VX9800 before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c
I had the VX9800 because when I was in college I would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes
However now that I am in the working world and basically only use my phone to call people I wanted a phone that was easier to carries around and was cute
I dont recommending this phones if your phone is your lifeit doesnts do much
However if you are just going to be using it to making calls and send the occasional text its wonderful
The pink colors that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeousits almost a purpleypinkish lavendar colors
In my opinion this pinks is prettier than the TMobile magenta and much much much nicers than the Cingular pinks I am not a fan of that one at all
In essence if youre looking for a hightech phone this is not it
If youre looking for a lightweight attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting this is a great buy
I just got my pinks razr phones and I love it so far
i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pinks phones
Even though it does not hadn't an antenna on the outside that you can see it still it works well
I was scared to buys this phones because I read some of the reviews and some of them werent saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it
When I first got my Motorola Q I was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every nights or be caught with a dying batteries in mid days
With some settings changes and the 1700 mAhs battery that is now far in the pasts
A little fatter than the regular battery which means a very tight squeeze in my Qholders but the extra power makes a big difference
I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screens protector only but also a squeegeem cloths and cleaning instructions
This shield fits very nicely over my phone screen
My friend from HK just got this phone and asks me to buy her an Eforcity screen protector
Hes been know to shown it off and got his holds phones all scratched up
Its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but I digress
The screens protects works as described it comes with a polish cloths and a plastings squeegees aplicator
The films has some kind of electrostatic polymer theres no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen
Squeegee helps to get out 1 air bubble that formed
It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when Im using it as a phones
It also serves as an excellent protectors when I throw it in my purses
My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases
Come on guys Women use these items too Also the rubber strip between the screens and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that Ive had this case
Other than those two things this is a great not bulky case
it is small and compact easy for travels but also good for homes uses
I am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone
I would recommend this holster to anyones who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed
I use my belt holster with all the phones ive owned my i530 is no
This belts holster feels really well made it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard I use it
A big pluss is that I can use my phone while its in the holster
works great there are a sets of lg heads phones that seperate and can be used to adapt your lg phone to what ever you wan
An extra Lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone
The desktop chargers comes with a second chargings slots so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts
I have found the 750 mah Lithium Ion Battery to be dependable nomatters at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging
It doesnt weakin as did my i1000s battery when chargings started at mid ranges
However the first time you charge or recharge your Lithium battery is the most important charges of all
You must letter the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery
The deader the batteries on its first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come
I am in northern Ohio and travel many places around the states
No matter where I have gone and I take my phones everywhere with me I have yet to find a place where my phone doesnts have Nextel service
I live on a farms here and we use the twoway often to communicate
My phones in particulars has been dropped several times once off a grains bins onto concrete 35 feet below and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud
I am extremely happy with Nextels services and phones
I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also cant complain
I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon Alltel Cingular and Sprint
Its a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged from my experience with Sprint they are terrible with no service anywhere and their phones suck too
I have used the i530 for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit or with NEXTELs service
To simplifying your reading here is a lists of pros and cons
Cons A little chunkies Lacks up to date features and tech such as color screen external display etcs
Pros Durability been dropped off a roof still going strong Looks yellow model Call quality is excellent Good speakerphone Digital 2way is a great feature
The only issue among the cons that is of any real concern is the battery life but this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones perhaps due to the nature of the iDEN network on which they operate
Even after two years my original battery lasts more than a days with moderate uses
A pains Slightly but given the advantages of NEXTEL its worth remembering to charged up more often
Please beware of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below my experience with their coverage customer services etcs
Just make sure you do your homework with respect to coverages before you sign up with any wireless company
Go with the one that gives the best coverages in the areas in which you live work or travel
Its always best to actually put the printed coverage maps to the tests with a real phone
NEXTELs maps are pretty legit at least as far as I have discovered
For two years now I have not had any problems with my Motorola i530 cell phone which is serviced by TelusNextel
Over all I would rate the service as good not excellent
Rarely I will have trouble getting service in a area where I would normally get a strong signal
This problem will normally last for roughly under a minute before my phone is once again operational
Im a daily commuter between Canada and the United States
My phones doesnt miss a beats it will automatically switch from Telus a Canadian server to Nextel an American servers and still have the same great reception
The cell phone itself is big bulky heavy and ugly
It does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or videos features
It does have a direct connect feature so you can use your phone like a walkytalkies when talking to a friends with the same options on their phone
The reception on the phones is clear and crisp it will seldom cut out of the conversation
Therefore I did not expect the quality of the sound of down loaded music to was so poor
I have thrown my phones across a room to a friend who failed to catch it more then once
One of those fancy little phones would has smashed into a million peaces
On a road trip my phone had fallen off my lap out of the car and sat on the side of the roads for three days in the rain
I had recharged the phone and it worked as expected
My phone has never let me down I have always gotten services and the batteries has not died on me thus far
The battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderate usage
If you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishments and do not desires all of those new phone gimmicks this phone is for you
i have this nextel it works verry good im verry happy with it
What can I say It works very well I keep this in my cars so when I travel I dont have to worrying about my Palm TXs batteries
This is the 5th Palm treo case I have bought in the last few years and it is the best by far
It holds the treos snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap
The clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot
I was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my Treo 700p but would allow complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it
In other words I didnt want something that was attached to the Treo permanently
There is one complaint sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk
I have the i850s but the i560s is what my wife has been using for about 3 months
The phones is so good my 2 year old cant destroy it hes tried Theres only 3 things I dont like about it it doesnt have a very big screen the external screens isnt color and it has no camera
Other than that its pretty much the same as the higher priced models like the i850s
and holding them together I suspect that they in facts have the same electronics inside minus the 3 things I mentioned above
If you dont took pics this really is the phone for you You can even submerge this things in water and it will still work without needing anything special It has GPS built in and all the java apps
Its everything the higher priced models have minus the camera and a smaller screen
Even though the screens is smaller its colors and very legible
The Motorola i560 is nicely sized easies to use and indestructible
These features are what to look for when looking for a new cells phones
Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones such as the i710 but it is the unbreakable model with outside display
Size is important especially with Nextel because most of their early models are very big and awkward like the i710s
The i560 is perfectly in between massive and tiny
This is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas
It is equipped with gripping as well which helps when it comes to using the direct connect placing calls and receiving calls
It is nice looking but is harder to keeping in your hand
More damages is done to the i710 because there is no gripping
If however the i560 does slip out of your hands dont worry
Dropping this phones is not a concerns due to extreme durability
If you are worried about scratching the outside get a leather or plastic covers for it
The ease of use between the i560s and the i710 is close because they have very similar menus options and simplicities however the big difference is in the outside displays on the i560
Without even opening the phones you can place a call by pushing the stops butts at the tops of the phone and scrolls through your most recent calls
The i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspects but an improvements is better than nothings
There is nothings worse than having to takes a cell phones in for repair or even worse having to replaces it
As much use as most people get out of their cell phones how it stands up to daily wear and tears is vital to satisfaction with a phones
The i560s is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel and is exceptionally tough
When the i710s is dropped it often goes to a blank screen and causes problems with reception and service
Overall performances masses and resiliences of the i560s surpasses the i710
My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screens with Cingular so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surfaces of what the i560 can do
Heres a breakdown of the pros and cons so far after a weeks
Nextels Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear
Any call either DirectConnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed
You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them
If youre concerned about radio RF radiation and you should are even though nobody talks about it anymore this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission points further away from you and improves the transmission
The speakerphones is as loud as you need it to am even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system very impressive
There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphones full duplex
You can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to
The phone is a little wider than some phones like the V60 but is very light
Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to gript and dials with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my mediumsized hand
Phone has slight hourglasses shape wider at the bottom to fit nicely into the hand
Phones has all the standard stuffs I love and couldnt live without voice dialing custom rings for calls from my contact list handsfrees long recent calls list up to 20 abilities to store number to Contacts from recent calls without having to key the number just have to entrancing the name
The phones is almost completely made of plastic and Ive never thought plastic was as durable as metal
While Motorola makes truly awesome phones I worry there might be an overreliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phones
When the phone is in the holster the outside display is not visible forcing me to removing the phone from the holsters to sees whos calling for those that dont have a custom rings configured or to check the time
Very annoying as Im used to using my phones as a watch
The icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eyes prescription might have troubles seeing and interpreting the icons
The only two parts that are clear the battery important and datetime
The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phones where you connect the charger etc make me think that someday Im going to look down there and finds it missing
Its easy enough to pop off but sometimes takes persuading to put back and have it cover the slot completely because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec
OVERALL I really like the phones and highly recommend it to all
The cover design is well made based on the requirements
The problem according to me is the devices not am not able to avoid the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides
In my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allowances you to easily inserting and remove the BlackBerry out of the cases
Im a heavy users of GPS Applications and Power Vision for websurfing on the go
I used to charged the phone twice a day now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even forget to plug it in at nights and I still have 2 bars of battery left half ways through the day
Even when i forget to charge it hasnt died on me
This battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone
Talks time and internet time are increased greatly
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast
Though that is still better than the original battery
I have no idea if it is as good as the one Sprint sells for 60 dollars
I just bought this battery at a Sprint Customer Service store and I paid 64
Im going to returning it today and buy it online here
Going from charging my phones a couple times a days to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900 making it less highmaintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing headset using and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time
Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind
Its been 12 hours and the things has yet to changes from 3 bars
What Aside from the piddling cost of this batteries which is about double the tax youd pays on a battery at a Sprint dealership there is the taxes of the bulges it creates on its backside
To me this is not insignificant but is ignorable as it doesnt detract from the aesthetics of the phones and it provides a way to gript it when dialing talking or using the buttons
The only complaint I had about my a900 was the batteries life
I am on conferences calls a lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the batteries pretty quickly
With this extended battery I am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly
Totally worth the 15 plus it arrived in about 4 businesses days with standard shipping
The Samsung A900 is a great phone a Motorola Razr on steroids
BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL You literally have to charges this phone at least two times per day to getting any real talks times
NOT ANY MORE The Bargaincell price was so low I was skeptical
PERISH THE THOUGHT I got the battery on time it was VERY well packaged
It fit the phones PERFECTLY as did the COVER it came with
I then used the phones for THREE DAYS without a recharge WHOO HOO BRAVO BARGAINCELL
BY THE WAY Even though this is a somewhat thick batteries it is SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE It does NOT add the bulk you might think looking at its picture
In fact I think the phones actually looks BETTER with the larger battery
I have a leather Bytech carry case designed for the RazrA900
Its a tight fit now but Im sure the case will stretches much like a new shoe does after its been worn a few days
The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid batteries life
And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprints
Nobody wants to charge their phones between 24 times a days
With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times
So of course I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial
Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found and I did extensive searching
Also this one comes with the doors which is very crucial
Ive seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door
You would be screwed without a doors that fits the extended battery
What would you do putting a rubber band around it Heck no
Well anyway now that I have this battery my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries
My A900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little
Dont worry youre phones will still look great with this batteries and you will enjoy all its features without dying
I initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained aboutuntil I applied the FIX Palm has identified that the Treo 680 devices can experience reduced battery life when the camera is used
The camera may continuing to drawing powers from the batteries when the device is in standby mode
680 users should install the Treo 680 Camera Update to addrest this issue
I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months Including Cingular HTC 8125 and Nokia E62 and can safely say that this is the best phones I have owned
The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operatings systems albeit less powerful and much more customizable and synchronizationfriendly than the Symbian OS
Very customizable interface making the phones very user friendly
You can set any application or any numbers to dial as a presets button
Palm OS is easy to use and thus you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phones unlike Windows Mobile which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS but cumbersome and difficult to use at times
very important for people like me who like to drive and textemail
Perfect size weight and feels of the phones in your hand and on your ear
The lacks of the antennae stubs on this models is a huge aesthetic improvement
Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop
Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you which is very useful although limits battery lives
Battery lives is somewhat worse than other phones
I have to charge my phones every nights and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet 30 minutes of mp3s player autoretrieve email every 30 min and 2 hour talk times as well as some other Palm functions
If you have it set on autoretrieve for your email the battery life seems to decrease impressively
The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently
You cant plug in your own headsets into the devices like your iPod headphones you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can got it from Palm
I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm instead of from Cingular
I got it for 350 with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included
Also if you get it from Cingular they always ruin the looks of the phone by plastering their logoes all over both sides of the phone
OVERALL extremely satisfied with this easy to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter battery lives
I had a Palm TX which I loved but didnt like having to went to WiFi sites for the webs
I also had a Moto V557 phone which is the best cell phone Ive ever owned
I purchased the Treo for the best of both worlds
I like the Treo 680 but I had to reading all of the instructions call customer services and practice using certain features to not are frustrated with the phone
For example I had difficulties answering the phones using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button
Which I usually missed while in a rushes to answer the phones
I like the web because its fast enough that I dont miss the WiFi
I had to gotten used to the fact that many web sites arent small enough for the phones but its excellent for using Google maps looking up business and giving the number for easy dial just tap the blue lines checking banks accounts online orders movies weather and especially the news
I absolutely love the chat setting on the messaging
People typically tell me that they cant hearing me so I now use a corded ears bud
The Bluetooth doesnt work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately
You cant insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions
There is no way to delete one digits at a time if you misdial a number
You have to leave the phone dialings page and returns to redial
The phone dials slowly if there are other programs running
And lastly you cant check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phones
You have to hang up with the people unlock the phone check the calendar and call them back
The battery lives is poor but I keep a charger in the car which helps a great deals
I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommend
They are Launcher Xexcellent Mobil Write Treo Voice Dialing The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows
I also recommend that you keep you Treo locked with a security password
I have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this 400 phone
It had more memories than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated
From my research I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my batteries lives to more than 10 hours
1I had to apply a cameras patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th
2 I needed to completely drains my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours
Once I did these two things my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge and Ive set my versamails to retrieve messages when they arrive
This is a big pluss for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive
Ive had no problems with any of my SD cards or miniSDs cards
The increase internal memories also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo
Ive heard the various complaints but you have to work through some of them
Upgrading from the Treo 650 it is true that there isnt much new
Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and nonmegapixel cameras leave one frustrated
But the facts remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the markets particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee
So I accept the current Palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries
That doesnt mean that I wont tell Palm Guys got your act together and come out with something far better
I needed a bluetooth headsets because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didnt want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear
I took a chance on this headsets even though I read a reviews saying that it didnt sync up well with the VX8300
Even though it is smallabout 112 the buttons are still large enough to use with ease
It also fits snug and comfortabe in my ears and works well with my VX8300
the headsets is great works really well with my samsung phone
the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to making it stay in my ears but its really great and i would buy it agai
Well I read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here but I decided to taken the plunges and go for it
All I can say is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the getgoes
It has its flaws but what phone doesnt The question is whether youre going went flip out over an alarms clocks or volume strip or is it a trivial issues for you
Most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me
My area has good Tmobile coverage so I cant complain
It also pairs with my blueteeth headset Plantronics 510 really well
99 plans and yes EDGE isnt the fastest but it gets the job done
It doesnt matter where Im at I can check my email finds restaurants or directions or just surfs the web when Im bored
It really came in handy when I was out on vacation and lost
Didnt want to bifurcate out the money for hotspots though
No its not going to replace my regular camera but I found it really handy when I forgot to take my camera to my friends wedding but was still able to take quality pictures
Mp3Video player Now the speakers on this phones arent the greatest so I wouldnt use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headsets it sounds pretty good
I bought a 2GB microSDs cards bought here at Amazon and now I can hold a ton music and movies
This thing is my travelinig entertainment centers
I even found a ways to playing original nintendo games on this things and have been trying Mike Tysons Punchout like back in the old days
Calendarschedule I had a PDA but for some reason Im more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedule on this things than I did with my Pocket PC
Smartphone applications Im in the medical fields and I keep all my medical applications on this phone
I can quickly look up drug references or research diseases
I really thought Id need a touchscreens in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a styli I dont find that its all that necessary and still navigate pretty well
I just wished the processors were slightly faster for some of these apps but its more than adequate
And Im not sure why people dont thinking there are a lot of programs for the smartphone
Programs written for WM5 are compatable with PPC as well as smartphones equally
Appearance Everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do I
I saw this sides by side with the Motorola Q and the Q just looked so much bulkier and
Battery For all that I use this phones for it makes it through the days with plenty battery to spare which is all I can really ask for
I wouldnt go 2 days without charging the battery though
Windows Mobile 5 Mighty Microsoft needs to write a cleaner program
However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will wasn't free to download for TMobile customers soon so hopefully thatll take cares of some of the problems
I swear just to turns on the bluetooth and pairs up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigates WM5
Adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best
Luckily my musicvideo programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volumes so its not such an issue for me
Alarm clock Now I dont use this all that much but I see what everyones says about it and yeah its a pretty idiotic written programs
However rather than writing half a page on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now goes on
Summary So I use this devices to making quality phone calls surf the web check email play games listen to music watches movies monitor my schedule check my medical references and take decent quality pictures
All this thing needs now is a laser beam that will cut through metal and itd was the greatest gadget known to man
When I got this phones I gave my PDA to my brother and my Razrs to my daughter
I love the full contact list with addresses all the phone numbers and notes that are in my Outlook and it syncs with Outlook
The calendar is really nice and that too syncs with Outlook
I dont trying to use it for browsing the internet but I do use Tmobiles Tzones to collect all my email from all my various email address types
It took some learnings to finds the easiest ways to get to everythings but its there is you look called and received numbers with one key presses extremely easy contacts look up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a push or two away
It has EVERYTHING that any cells phone has and works as well or better and easier
The speaker phone is great and one touch or speeds dialing is great
I can store hundreds of phones numbers at numbers I choose then use the spot number to make a call instead of looking up numbers ie Lees cells is spot 5 home spot 15 offices spot 25 I found a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phone
Some areas I have services where friends with other providers dont and some areas they have service I dont
All in all I find that I have service across the country without much trouble and I drive
If you have Tmobile cell service their tzones for email and many other internet based services is only 5 and WiFi service is only 20 monthly cants beat that
The full keyboard makes text messagings and keeping notes MUCH easier and more fun
Its not a full PDAs but it does everything I did with my PDAs
Its way more than a phone really small and thin easy to carries easy to lock and unlock the keyboards
It takes nice pictures for emergencies if I dont have my camera and it uses a mini SD card which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos
Personally I cant thinks of a negative things about it
Its not a laptop computer but I think its the best cell phones on the markets
My cousins has the blackberry and hes jealous of me and my Dashes
Ive had multiple PDAs that have crashed and multiple phones in the pasts
I had a great Nokia phones but wanted to combine into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago
Been able to make and receive phone calls call clarities is excellent and with TMobile I have services in my office unlike other coworkers phones
Everyones is jealous their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking
I really enjoyed having the email and internets feature
The only issue Ive had at all is with the volume control when Im surfing the net or playing ball breaker I hold the phone and often hit the volume controls
Everything else works as describeds and Im very happy with my choices
When I was looking to combine my phones I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews I picked this one
This is my first SmartPhone and Ive had a lot of funs with it so far
For being so small the keys are remarkably easy to use
If you have Windows XP along with MS ActiveSync 4
0 your PClaptop will recognize it as a networks device
A little bonuss app on the Dash lets you share the Internet connection granted you have the data plan at no extra cost
If you get the addon micro SD card about 80 youll have no need to buy an iPod
Windows Media Player which comes standard works just as well
When Im in range of wifi I can use Skype and save my minutes
I hope TMobile doesnt read this since theyll probably patch that loophole
The battery charge doesnts last longer than a days or so if youve got data push to Outlook enabled
The volume strip on the righthands sides drives me nuts
When I do an annoying popup interrupts whatever Im doing
You can disable the volumes strip but its kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player
A simple classic volumes dial on the side would be a huge improvement
The strip never seems to work right when I really intend to adjust the volume
The keyboards is nice but a touch screen would be better for certain apps
I have tried many many cells phones but this phone is unbelievable
Right now I have a 140000 words dictionary on it the NIV bible Star Wars many videos of my sons about 100 wma songs and a ton of pictures
It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts appts tasks and emails are always up to date
It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset
It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy
I have not found a smartphones that even comes close to these features especially for the price
I like it waaaay better than the treo blackberries Q or any other qwerties device
The MPT versions is Ok but more value is for seem editing for professional and expert users only
The headset works fine people who I talk to says they get better sounds so wind preventions goes well but I doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk times also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset
After trying this phone out a few days here are my personal results
What attracted me to this phones were the fitnesses features flip phone design and the rugged design
You have to calibrate it manually if you want the best results but right out of the boxes its been okay so far
Ive had other mp3 cell phones LG VX8500 Chocolate Samsung SCHA930 Motorola SLVR L7 and this one blows all of the others out in this categories
Granted this is not going to contending with the iPod but for a cell phones the Walkman abilities are impressive
But then I guess almost anything is an upgrade over the Verizon OS
The lengths of the headphones cords is way too long for running at least for me personally
Its taken me a few times to figures out somethings comfortable in terms of cord managements
My hands arent big by any means but I still have troubles with some of the dedicated buttons Walkman Internet Shortcuts Power OnOff
I said I dont use the camera feature often and im glad I dont for this camera
This has the be the most stripped down barebones 2 megapixels cameras I have used
Overall I must saying that I am satisfied with my purchase Im still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phone
I had the choice between this and the W810i for the same prices at the Sony Store and I opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and I must say that these two features havent let me down yet otherwise I wouldve gone for the W810
So I welcome myself to the more powerful world of the Cell Phones
Ive been a fans of Sony Ericssons phones after Ive seen what they really do and when I had the Z500a long time back when I won the phone during hurricanes seasons I thought the phones was great
My only thoughts were that despite the phone being a Flip Phone and having a Music Player that the phone only had 15MB of spaces to begin with and to top it off its camera wasnt great
I have already made a few quick stations buttons on the W710 and the best parts is that I feel original with the fact that Im the only one that has it in my schools and among my friends
Most people Ive seen the only chances they have is getting the W810 and while that phone looks ok the W710 just fits me right
The phones colors scheme the styles of the phone the phones technogeekness for those of us who love technology and the fact that many people namely the girls find it a cute phone Dont know weather that is good or not but at least it attracts some attentions
The fact that the phones user interface is for the most part the same as every phone from SE it makes it that much easier to learn the phones buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old Z500
With 2GB of expanded memory that I put in it and the phones already 17MB of internal space the phones has many possibilities And the last part before I go is that with the fact its an Active phone you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day checkers your training and more It even gives you rewards for being active
So for those needing a nice looking phone want walkman powers for mp3ss and FM Radio knowing your fitness activity this is the phone for you
Note I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphones so my review is based on how well the w710is features work in comparison
I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in orders for the phone to function
My sons Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not
Ive also purchased the z710is for my sons and will review that one later
Excellent voices qualities with headsets wired or bluetooth
shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features
Abilitys to buy an international SIM cards to avoiding extra fees
Can double as a modems via bluetooth or usb cable if you dont have unlimited internet packages be very careful as they charge big
FM radio receptions is soso in the downtown area
standard or flight mode option to use while on airplane
The international charger with an adapters for US outlets
Inabilitys to syncs with any computer using Windows Vista Im sure a workarounds is coming
I havent used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounters accuracy
Others have warned about holdling the phones and interferring with the antenna I havent had a problem with this
Since I have other Sony phones I am disappointed that they have changed the shapes of the connection for the syncs and charger
Translation you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generations phones
There is no way to charges the phone and use the wired headsets
You either listened to the radios or charge the phone
You can not use the standard overthecounters headsets because there is no outlets for it
Need to switch settings to view more than one email accounts
Yet another memories card format microanother adapter needed
picture callers ids only works after you open the phone edit March 212007 if you have answer on open sets
I purchased my W710i from an internet company for 254
00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days
Overall Sony has always produced quality products
I love this phones and it is a very good comparisons to a SmartPhones
If you dont needn't the bells and whistles of a smartphones goes for the Z710i as it is a bits cheaper but a great contender
If I could rate it more than 5 stars I would even though I havent tried all of the features of this phone
When it hit the clip battery cover and batteries scattered in different directions on the floors
The damages is a barely noticeable mark on the upper lefts of the phone
I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again
The mp3s players is simple to use accessible while the phones is closed and sounds great
You can use any headsets or earbuds you prefer and the radio makes it the devices of choice for gymrats or runners alike
Sturdy fairly easy to figures out and fine reception
A great phone if you dont needing smartphone features
Sony Ericsson W710i is a very nice cells phone 85090018001900 GSM pedometers bluetooth gprs IR 2Mpix cameras mp3 players 512 MB included and so on
The original batteries never lasted an entire day if I talked very much
With this replacement battery I never run out of power anymore
The battery is a little bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip
The new batteries comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly
When I looked at my bill Amazon did not closure out my previous 2 months I had left on my contracts with Cingular
So Cingular tried to charging me some liquidation fee of 30
I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer
I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned
The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didnt intend but its really not that big of a deal I just need to retrain my hands
I am happy with the picture quality as well as video qualities
The audios options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple tasks
This phones is incredible and Im so happy I bought it through Amazon
very good deal and smooth transactions I definitely recommend getting this phones
even in places that were dead zones with my other phones
Only a few backgrounds ringtones to chose from without downloading your own
I also bought the data cable package through Amazon and it worked beautifully from the first try
I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations
I will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews
With the cables that came with my girlfriends V3i I have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone
There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not transfer blahs blahs blah but there have been only very few songs with any problem
I have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2GB mico card I bought and it has been great
The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sounds volume and qualities for the sizes
Playlists will also continue to plays when the phones is closed which I found a very nice and convenient touches
I reupped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal reception which is nothing to sneeze at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR so I didnt have some POS crap phones prior to the KRZR
As with RAZRs you have to be careful not to hit the internet buttons i wish you could lock keys like on Nokia but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that
I wish Motorola provided you with a disks full of programs INCLUDED with the phones like I was able to get with my Nokia 7610 but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself
Some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on RAZRs and KRZRS but for an average sizes guy with average sized hands this has not been a problem at all
I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wirelesss New Every Two programs
My main gripe with the phone is that unlike my former phone Motorola V265 it can not be set to display the time in the 24hour format I do not use ampms
Otherwise the screen is nice and bright its easies to use its much less bulky than my former phone and the voice activation is easier
Works for me as I dont use the phone for internetemail or uses lots other features
Advanced video captures decent zooms and playbacks abilities
Great for travel with excellent sounding MP3 players integrated Bluetooth ready and big hard drive for tunes
Its thin easy to dialed through and seeing through easy to get it on and off
before is dropped the phone and cracked the screens
I HAVE dropped it since getting this cover and it was just fine
Ive used this model headset for 6 months and the sounds quality is great
I drive a truck for a living and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck
The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort
Only problem is it disconnects sometimes at rests
It beeps when it disconnects and reconnects automatically usually within a minute or two
I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product but thats not to say that that the product is not without some flaws
The reception clarity and batteries lives is quite good
Also my hearing isnt the greatest and love the fact that you can turned up the volume on this unit and donts have to strain to hears
My one complaint about the products is that the loops piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of uses and often separates from the unit
Ive gotten used to the drills of reattaching the loop prior putting it on but its still very annoying at times
Even with this slight annoyance I would definitely buy this products agai
I just got the cables and the software for my Motorall V600 and its very easy to use
I just did a backups of all my contacts pics and musics
Is Good protecss every corner of your phone the keyboard and the screens Its very good 100 Recomendation
I really like the fit and functions of this Cingular 8125 case
All the holes are in the correct location and the belt clip is comfortable no sharp edges to irritate
I ordered 2 other cases elsewhere that did not fit properly and I sent them back
Shippings was also quick 34 days My only complaint is that sometimes it is hard to get into the phone and the cords is only about 3 feet long wish it was longer
Soft leather attractive looks and very easy to use
Overthetop straps easily secures blackberry in places
Blackberry can easily be slid in and out of the holster
I purchased this with my brand new blackberry 8703e and have not observed a single scuff or scratch on the device after numerous times sliding the phones in and out of the holster
The only potential negative is the plastic belts clip starts to dig into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of times
This is the prettiest one I think There are other pinks but they are tacky
It keeps my phones from getting scratched up and its really cute
Although the i607 BlackJack was not listed on the packagings as a compatible device it works perfectly
The earbudss sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a buttons to answer a call
Even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly
good products for how cheap is got it for absolutely nothing wrong with it
I travel a lots so somethings like this I would use to replace all my other USB cables
I forget which sellers I purchase from but its small lightweights and shoudl ship quick
Not looking to spend the cash for Bluetooth but need something to work This is it
With the extra buttons you can answer put a call on hold or hang up without fumbling for your phones
I really dont opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly
The sound quality is really good and people on the other ends can hear me quite well
I had ordered this case just for my wife and it fit like a glove
We both have Sprints Katana and you can not find a better cases at its prices
I bought this for my Sanyo Katana phones which is a bits thickers than the Razr
My only problem is that due to the design I sometimes accidentally pushed the buttons on the side of the Katana when I take it out of the case
I love this phone covers it looks amazing I am concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached
This cover is what my baby blackberry needed to be protected and safe
The cradles has 2 cords a 110v power cord thats just for charging the spare battery and a usb cords for chargingsyncing the 8125
I just bought this headset for use with an LG VX8300
The stereo headset lets you listen to music and talk on the phone has microphone built in
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thicknesses somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thicknesses gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratches
I like the designs of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS cars holder but does did what is was designed to do
It gives good protection eases of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and buttons on the Treo
My one complaints is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The buttons layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to seeing if theres a way to removed these somehow
The software supplied lets you replaces your PDA with this phone
0 megapixels cybershot cameras of the nats so recent past No problems what so ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegance
The flipphones factor lets you talk comfortably and safely with the antena safely away forming your brain
The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches
AMAZINGs battery life surprising for an MP3 phone
I have had it for a weeks now and it works flawlessly
I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phone before but I am really happy
The Camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great receptions
Definetly a phone to pick up if you are looking for a new one
This phone forms Amazon actully comes with the 64MB versions of the Memory Stick Microtm M2tm NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phones
It also feels a bits light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand
But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera
It also seems to get really good receptions as another reviewer has stated
The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your fingers
The way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose receptions
so you just have to remember that when talking to someones
The inside screen is really really bright I turned it all the ways down to saving the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell
The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too especially if you ride the buses and listening to a lot of musics
this is the 2nd SE phone after T637 and this phones is just better
using it with TMobile it works pretty well as phone and modems
voice the strongest part the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years the speakerphone is OK not so loud
receptions another strongest parts with TMobile it can get some weak signal when all other dont get signal at all however the antennae is located at the top back where the loop is touching this part will lose receptions
operations typical SE style pretty easy for SE users 3 dedicated buttons web messaging task
cam excellent even though it doesnt have autofocus like K750 and K790 it looks pretty good even its better than nokia 6270
bt very easy to use and pair with pcs suite installed file transfers and syncs is just a pieces of cake the transfers speed is 300400kB this is the maxima of bt 2
screen the main screen is pretty bright even I have to set the brightnesses down animated standby screens is simply cool external screen however is monochrome it maybe a plus when using outdoors the main is barely viewable under sunlight it display info only its a kinda inconveient when doing selfpic
audios player I seldom use it because it doesnt supports ogg vorbiss which I mainly use streaming audio supports real only no shoutcast
conclusion this phone is a pretty good phone for the price quadband is a must for Cingular users fast EDGE modem for webs and tetherings
no defaults USB mode always asks when plugs in kinda annoyings
They shipped quickly keep me updated and the cables arrived well packaged
Cable is cheap works perfectly and arrived quickly
All you have to do is download the software from the samsungs website and plug it in
When I ordered this item I already knew it didnt come with the driversoftware cds but minutes after I ordered it DLN sent me an emails telling me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me the link
im kind of bummed that that charge feature doesnt work on my phone D807 but thats just an issue with my phone I guess and nothings with the product
Reason 1 It keeps on charging your cells phone when you are transferring data trust me this helps when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cells phone
Reason 2 Only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred so this way you will knowing before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seats of your car
You will have to use windows media player to sync this phone Samsung Sync SGHA707 in orders to transfer files
MP3 and WMVWMA formats work with this phone i do not know whether other formats work or not
Let me explain in brief how to syncs this phone with windows media players
Connect one end of the cable to your phones first and the USB end to your computer USB ports Preferably USB 2
If you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media cards when you open My Computer on your computer
Now open Windows media player you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu
From left to right you will be able to sees in this order Now Playing Library Rip Burn Sync and Guide
Make sure your Cell phone is connected now you will see two halves in the same window left halves is for you to drag and dropping your file that needs to aren't transferred and right halves is where it goes your cell phone names apears on the top usually windows media player prepares to transferring the file this takes a while
Also just above the right window in the drops down box make sure you select Samsung media card as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory
Once you are well versed with what your phone can played i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB readerwriters as windows media players takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfers this saves you a chunks of time and battery power
This cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere
I received the cable quickly and the companies even sent me an email to lettered me know where to download the appropriate program free from the Samsung website
I ordered this USB cable for my Samsung SYNC and it came fast
While there is no software provided I quickly found out it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could add musics to my phone
After searching I found that Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their websites for FREE If you want to fully utilize your Syncs camera and MP3 capabilities I highly recommend buying this inexpensive wires and going to Samsungs site for the free software

If you own a Q you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible
This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery which is great
So I can charges my phones with the standard batteries and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot
Also it makes a wonderful stand for the phone and when hooked to the USB cable you get data conectivities too
Only downside it wont charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged
The plugs fit fine I got the 2 pack and I get STEREO sound through both headphones
If you do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will NOT gotten stereo sound
My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony isolation headphones work fine with this adapter
Maybe Im just lucky but for this low price this adapter is fine
If you want sterling sound you shouldnt be listening to mp3 anyway
I can hear the limitations of my files on the treo so its clearly good enough
This is the kind of thing you dont care about unless it malfunctions
It seems sturdily built and unlikely to broke easily
The rightangle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snapped off in the device A problems with straight plugs
It doesnt seem to have been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well
I wondered if the snaps on concept would feel and look secure
Its rock solid and looks like its part of the phone
Additionally the extra protection it provides to the little screen is wonderful
Id love to buy more colors whenif they become available
I am very surprised how well this case fit my Razr V3M
Great for the price vs buying it from your cell phone company
The cable works great with my SGH707 but the cd did not had the right drivers
However you can download the correct drivers from samsungs
I recomend to buy the cable and then download the driver for your phone
The cables was perfect exactly what I needed but it took ways too long over ten days to get here
Holds the phone in an attractive snug leathers case Clips to belting and holds tight
Since the phones is horizontal and not vertical I dont have trouble catching it on things
Ive broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the cars
The phone would catch on something and the plastic clips would snap
This case works great and eliminates that problem The perfect solution
The L2 uses the same cases so they both fit within this rubber case
However the keys are laid out differently on the L6 so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys
I didnt give it a low rating because its well built and is actually a really great product just wanted to gave other L2 owners a warnings
It works well but its just a little funky on an L2 but totally usable
For the price you just cant beat it and its a much better option than watching your phones pop into 2 or 3 pieces each times it falls out of your pocket
Even though the keys are covered it is still pretty tactile
Would have liked something to protect the screens
After about a year the ear supports on this Bluetooth headset broke
Good news it has a 2 year warranties and Logitech is replacing it with a Mobile Traveller model since the Mobile Freedom is no longer made
Contact Logitech Tech Support Audio by phones cant weren't done over the web
Its nice to see a company stand behind their products
Works great its a bit bigger than some headsets but in this case I feel thats a good thing the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you dont get a feedback loops where the person youre talking to hear themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker
The only complaint would isn't I wish the volumes went up just a bit more it can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly
the holes to plug the chargers into is under the thing that holds it onto your ear it rotates out of the ways
It took me awhile to find it when I first got it
To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either
Feedback loop Where the other people hears themself speak
Ambient noise The other end hears everything around you especially in a car
In minimizing these the Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best
Ive tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voices clarity without extraneous noises
As for me I hear everyones fine on all the headsets but a conversation is a twoway street and if youve ever used a headsets Im sure youres tired of hearing Take me off that stupid things
The negatives with this headset are far outweighed by the calls clarity
Yes its big and ugly but your friends will thank you
The other negative to be aware of although I assume this is more due to the age of my headset as its only recently started doing this is that Ive found is that after 1 years while the battery still holds a charges well it sometimes drops the link to the phones when I hang up after a call and I cant get it back until I recharge the things
Overall if I was going to buy a new one Id get this one
As far as the other 3 tested Ill rank them in order of call quality best to worst
Plantronics Discovery 655 not too bad but hard to keep in your ear
Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX more for wireless stereos headphones than for calling
Motorola HS850 Looks cool but a total piece of garbage
If youre wondering why I have 4 headsets its because theres nothings worse than losing the uses of one of your hands while talking on the phones
Ive had several gens of the candybar blackberries 7100 nice but receptionmikes was horrendous 7130 much better finally nailed it
Was dubious when I had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky
Slightly smaller than 7130 which oddly does make a differences like size decreases give exponential feasibilities increases or something
Makes my partners Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparisons
The pearls trackballs is just fine like it better than roller actually
Reception mike quality are also good despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130
Writing is good too the suretype continuing to being so durn accurates I sometimes forgotten to check
So I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone the one that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great
If you need bulletproof emails PDA and phone this is yr babies
Slightly shorter batteries lives but hasnt stranded me yet
My first blackberry and I love it I wanted to stop lugging around a phones AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts calendar and tasktodo list
I wanted a phones that synched with Outlook and was a great phone
I didnt really care about internet musics or cameras but the cheapest 30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to homes email instantly its just great I bought the 40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it
I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and its GREAT to be able to instantly recognize whos calling from the music
Camera is ok not great but ok and very nice to have for onthespots photos that you dont want to lug around the regular digital for
I actually emailed a pictures on the spot very cool
However Im not a heavy user and I used the profiles to hadn't phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day
Only cons so far are 1 getting used to the keypad believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypads figuring out the correct word
Ive followed other folks advice and dont really look at the words letter by letter i type a sentences and then looking it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word
Still this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry users but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim
2 Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone I have to reseat the batteries to get the change to taking effect
3 Volume when talking even on speakerphone is average not terrible but ok
4 I also wonder how long the track ball will last Im not a heavy user and I still use it constantly
I think im going to buy the insurance plan just in case
These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more
Its true what some say Im a crackberry because playing with this things is addictive
Ill update this review again in 3 months or so but I dont anticipate any problems
My only regrets is I didnt hold out until a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosks
Top line This is the best BlackBerry Ive ever used and among the best phones Ive ever used
I can use it at work and after hours with out compromises in functionality and stylesize
Ive been some what grudgingly using Blackberry since the first pagerstyle 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthrough for me
Finally I have a corporate devices that treats me like a consumer
Great voice dial particularly if you are a commuter with a headset
No need to record your voices for each address entry just say who you want to call and it it doesnt understand you it will prompt you for more info
Size and appearances Finally I dont look like a dork talking to something the size of my palm
The phone is as small as many phoneonly candy bars
Easy private emails setup as with all modern BlackBerries
Seems to have some sort of auto setup for Mac mail and Gmail others too I imagine
Macintosh compatibilities I just bought The Missing Sync for Apple Mac OS X 40 USD to synchronize my addresses book calendar tasks and notes from my MacBook Pro
Works great The software provided by RIM is not very easy to use
Fantastic screen and innovative Outlook Today style summeries screens for missed calls latest emails etc
Look for this feature in one of the alternates themes that ships with the phone
As others have mentioned the keyboards is very good
Coming from a full sizes BB keyboard I thought I might miss it but the 8100s is a breeze to use
Speaker phone is functional and sound quality in general is fine
I think I have a minor voices quality issue between the phones and my Motorola H700 headset the best headsets Ive ever owned
More Mac compatibility would am not appreciated like native iSync and bluetooth support
In fact this is the first cells phones Ive had where I had a data plan setup
I got ta say Im luving it My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop
The browser is very robust and seems to work great
Ive installed a few extra applications google maps bbweather and Yahoo go to name a few and I havent had any problems
The applications cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful
I still have yet to try the Opera browser for the BB
The camera is so clear with and without the flashes its scary
Ive discovered that the moniker CrackBerry is so true
Im just hooked on getting emails surfing the web and listenings to some tunes all from the same device at the same times
Ive discovered a whole community of simmilar BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of this device
The pearls suretypes keyboard learns as I go and words it didnt get right at first it now picks up and selects as I type
I dont even need to censor the typing too often anymore
I stuck with the suretype mode and caughts on to it right quick
This may be because Ive never used any other types of mobile devices keyboard prior to the pearls
My only complaints are that the mp3 players will not plays through a wireless headset
You can trick it into doing so but normal plays is only through the speaker on the devices or through the wired headset
Also the speakerphone is a bits muffled as the batteries cover actually covers up the speaker Now there are after mod kits that have an oem batteries cover with a hole for the speakerphone but come on
Finally the vibration of the phone is kind of weak
Overall this device is great for beginners like myself
I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device
Its stylish beautiful small and it has some awsome features
However since i bought it from Amazon Cingular took forever just to approbate me and giving me a new number
So I constantly had to calling amazon and ask them about my orders
Then I receive the phone almost a weeks later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didnt want to work
So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card
Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the services when Amazon told me there was somethings wrong with my SIM cards LOL
Overall Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activations process because it wasnt easy
But whatever I love shopping Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will loved it too
Ive had this phone for about a weeks now and Im glad I waited to posts a reviews because my initial reaction was not very positive
Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windowsbased devices there was an initial learnings curves to some of the functions
Also I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type
My motivations for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the devices
Loading ringtones a pains at first proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research
The music player is MUCH better than first impressions would lead you to believes
After a few hours of frustration I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app
Again did some research visited a few forums and found out there is much more functionalities in the included musics player than you might realize
As an owner of a NANO I was disappointed with the interface of the player
But once you go into the menu functions youll find much more functionality
Its not an ipods but it works as an decent replacements
And if youres not an ipod owner youll likely have no complaints
Sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones
Camera is only soso but I dont really cares about that anyway
Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera
The couple of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy
As far as email I have a BB from work and they wont let me use a nonworks issued device to access the networks so I have no opinion on email functionality
Organizer features calendar tasks notes etc seem more than adequate
The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I havent been able to figure out and while Im admittingly not a techie these should isn't pretty basic and intuitive
One I would like to set one of my ringtones as the default ringers
That should am fairly simplistic but I cant figure it out
Two I would liked to change the order of the icons on some of the themes
Almost forgot cant listen to music through blueteeth
Not sure why but this is really my only MAJOR complaints
And BTW form factor and looks are simply the best out there
I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack very happy that I went with the Pearl
UPDATE Figured out how to setting defaults ringtone and move icons
Coming from a Windows mobiles environment I was expecting something along the lines of Startprogramsetcetc
I was simply expecting it to aren't much more difficult based on my prior experiences
Im going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo
Otherwise as close to a perfect device as Ive used and Ive used quite a few
This is my first BlackBerry phone and I must say its an awesome device My husband has a BlackBerry through his works so I got one too
How we can PIN each other keep in touch via emails etc
The Pearl has wonderful reception great styles great features etc
It had a few issues but generaly speaking it worked well
Unfortunately one of my big concerns was the phone size
When I first Bought it I did not thought it woud be a big deal
But after having it for a whiles it felt like I was carring a bricks in my packet If you are an smart phone user then you know what I am talking about
I wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size
I was debating between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearl
At first I thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palm Q or bjack but I had it for 3 months now and to told the truththeres is so many advantages on this phone I do not miss my palm at all
The pearls not only does not have the flaws that palm does but also has the same or more capabilities and browsing speed
The trackball works way better than a touchscreen
So far I am very happy with my purchases that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack
The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring a phone and not a brick in my packets
Not sure about it then do not believe me simply check the reviews of all smarth phones online
You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other smart phones
This product was perfect all I needed to move pictures from my phone to my pc
neat cable good connectors but havent established communications between PCs and cellphone with cable yet
The silicones protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brands prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the designs of this unit as it leaves the keyboards exposed and thus it is easy to type
The functions buttons are under the skin but easy to pressurized
The protective skins is a bit too thick for some applications GPS cars holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection eases of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keeping it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was customs formed for every curve bump and button on the Treos
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The buttons layouts is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the buttons covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehows
I have had it for six months and it is the best one I have ever had
I like it so much that I dont wan na get rid of it
This phone is great I got it for Christmas and it works like a charm The loud speaker is excellent and the ringtones are cool
Some of the wallpapers are a bit weird but they have nice ones too
The ringtones are loud and you can easily hear it ringing
the LCD screens is big and the menus are easy to navigate
The buttons are a comfortable size and I love this phones
So far I havent found any flaws at all and the phone has great battery life
I had to keep it on for a few hours and the bars stayed the same I highly reccomend this phone to any who like it
The phones is light weights and small and it doesnt get in the way I love this phone and have encouraged someone to get one already
Even though it doesnt have a camera Id say that it is still great As for the cons
I can not thinking of any and anyone who says that you can not hear it ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong company
Virgin Mobile is great but not designed for those people who are on their phones all day
I bought this little phones 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it
I got it to keeps with me when Im driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now
It has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars
What I like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can am not easily tucked inside pockets or small bags
It charges fully in a very short time under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hours after that
It holds that charge for a very long times as I just found out recently
Driving to an appointment I was running late and needed to calls to let them know
Id forgotten to recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornails
To my delight it turned right on and I made the call with no problems
The Virgin prepay plan is perfect for users like me and ends up costing about 6 a month
Tell me theres something better and Ill say prove it
I looked long and hard to find the best possibility and this was it
For a nice dependable insurances type phones I couldnt be more pleased and genuinely recommend it
This phones is great It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phones and I was able to fix the low ringtone problem by searching for audiovox 8610 hack over the internet
You can purchase a cable on ebays and dl some free softwares over the net
Then you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free
Of course you have to is computersavey to do so
So dont do it unless you know what youre doing
The phones allows 20 seconds of mp3 and midi playbacks for each ringtones
The cool things is that each ringtone can be attached to a phones numbers in the phonebook so you know whos calling by the rings
I downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from the net and mix n match them into an mp3 files for some great ringtones
example 3 stooges sound bell ring whistle homers doh wolf howl all in one 20 second ringtones
I also made some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well
I noticed some songs and soundeffects are louder than others
Thus I only keep the loudest ringtone and theyre very loud I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the ring in my pockets and backpack
Overall this phones is always on sale at places like Target
If you can make your own ringtones and downloads it into the phone you can hasn't all the free custom ringtones you could ever dreams of
I have to admit if you want more from prepaid Virgin Mobile is a rips off
But if youre only going to use your phone once in a while then its alright
I bought my Audiovox about a years or two ago and it was a good investments
Sleek phone outer dsiplay the calls were good quality and I never would get dropped calls
Furthermore the color display is great and the batteries life is amazing
The phone has all the basic features looks great and is practical for anyone who not looking for anythings outrageous like cameras or Mp3
I have also say that despite the services Vmobile has good phones
But now that Im needing my phones more and more Im ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the whole 25 cents a minutes and 10 cents after that is too expensive
And for their new promotions those hardly last and are only for new customers
The ringtones are a little pricey but still reasonable tests messagings is available at 10 cents good price
If you want to got more features minutes whatever I say look into other prepaid offers like net10 tracphone or Tmobile
You get more prepaids with tmobiles but the phones with good stuff will cost you a bits more
im also 14 yrs old and ive owned this phones for about 2 months
but i couldnts switch my carrier and it was waayyy expensive
so i looked for a fone that is great for texting and i wouldnt have to paying alot for texting
the only thing is it doesnt have an mp3 player nor a camcorders
also it is a bit bulky and it doesnt have as much features as the enVs
this fone has instant messagings and multimedia messagings
virgin mobiles services is good but i have to be honest i do not use this fones to talk but only to text
u dont have to be a teenager to hasn't this fones but this fone is ideal for a textcrazed teenager
i jus found out that kyocera has a new upcomings fone
I bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago so I got a good deal on it
Well as some have mentioned the phones has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard
Other than that I have had no problems call reception is great
The camera on this phone isnt the greatest but I dont needed it to were high end for the basic fun pics I take
If youre looking to get zoom in larger clearer pictures this isnt the phone for you
The camera screens can be a bit confusing but Ive learned to deal with it my pics come out as I like
A strange feature is the speakerphone while it is quite loud clear Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound
The QWERTY keyboards is perfect for txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small
As far as plans are concerned I dont have any problems w over charges since I have the 18 centsmins plan
Its good to knowing that the monthly plans arents recommended though
A bonus to the per minute plans is the Sugar Mama service where you get free airtimes for giving your opinion on minute video clips
Good for purchasing games or ringtones wo using up your topup money
And this cells isnt only for the young crowd Im an over 25 moms
I got this phones bcs other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones those that do require addtl internet service plans like Blackberrys Black Jack Palm TREOs
I only wanted to easily sends txts have it in one compacts phones
I can say I have been a realtor a nursean HR person a mom
I remember my first digital phone and first pnone with games
I have had a total of 5 phones motorola nokia ericson panasonic
I dont want a treo palms because I already travel with a laps top
What I want is a text phone that is small and easy to use
The menu is just like a computer and easy to make selections
The more features you need on the phones the more you want a qwerties key boards
Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it
Very sturdy little phone and the antena is the loop so it wont poke you
Comes with a very easy to read guide book so start up is easy
I paid 199 for this phones in my region and it is worth every penny
I have a Motorola V220 phones and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month
The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet
Its fairly light weights and made of plastic but seems durable enough
A small red LED lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet regardless of whether youre charging your phone or not
I debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price
I purchase this phone for both my wives and I and we both love them
Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time to learn to navigate but is very versatile and functional
Receptions and call quality are great and pairing with a bluetooth headset was quick and painless
There is no 3g in my area but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple webs browsings
This phones comes with both a standards and extended battery
With pretty heavy usage I still have 12 batteries powers at night
Lots and lots of 3rd party software available to make this phone do pretty much whatever you want
Ive been using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it
Sure there are things I would changing but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes
The keyboards buttons are really small but then Im not sure how you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger
If you ever seeing an ad that has a number like this 1800BigDeal good luck on figuring out the alphatonumeric translation
I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr and really miss this feature
The lists would be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone
Browser support is awesome I can view everything even Flash apps
Glass screen doesnt scratch and screen resolutions is unbelievable
Quick toggle scroll button on side is a lives savers
No having to slid the batteries off to remove or replace
I hear the iPhone is supposed to be the real deal but until I see for myself Im sticking with this beauty
Free Cant go wrong which ever way you look at it
It is the best windows mobile phone currently available in my oppinion
There is no LCD light to telling you its charging status instead the screen has to be on all the time
There is no way to know when the num lock key is on so you just have to press a numbers key and see what comes up
In order to unlock the phone you have to pressures the onoffs button at the tops of the phones which is not in a very convenient location
this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and pictures qualities
Great feature is the off phones batteries rechargings and the included second battery
Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phones dies should keep the lives of the battery longers
Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome
When cellphone first came out this was a standard features then it was optional then it was gone
Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player
Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating
Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play
Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11
Sorry Win2k users forget NT or Win9X or Me video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XPs
Get a MicroSD card and put your musics on that card and you can play it from there
Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memories
Since this is a MS Smartphone there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phones
Be aware of the aspect ratios this is a landscape display and not portraying
If you get games or applications for it be sure of the aspect ratios
Size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness
The thumbwheel is great for navigations and web browsing
Camera is slow and not very clear but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either
The ones that come with this phones are lame at best
The ones that come with it are OK but taken some navigation to gotten around
Hate the Cingular activations policies and cost for the internet access service but that is not the phones fault so maybe I should not list this complaint
Product is ok dont think itds protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up
But it is aesthetically appealing will protect from small scuffs and scrathes
It is unbelievably inexpensive for how well it works
I was concerned with the 1 star review so I ordered from desirepro who had a higher rating instead of Eforcity
It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pockets
This case is about 12 inch widers and thicker but it protects the phone on all sides except the top
It looks great and the magnets puts it to sleep which is nice
Even though it is a bit more bulky I cant go back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks
I just use a screens protector but many use Best Skins Ever with it no problem
You can pretty much do anything you would like with this product The only draw back that i could finding is that it doesnt charges while you have it plugged in
Other then that you can managers anythings you would like
after talking to cingular i found out that is would have to spend 40 to get a cable to connect my samsung d807s to my laptop
and i can manage anything on my phone that i wan
Had heard other replacements styluses didnt quits fit properly
These replacements styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacements for the original phone stylus
Works just fine Delivery was earlier than predicted
I looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a simple thing but they didnt have them
I ordered it one evening while wearing my pajama and it came right to my doorno muss no fusses
This is the way to buy such items Thanks for a great job
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thicknesses somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thicknesses gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratches
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to typifying
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skins is a bit too thick for some applications GPS cars holders but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handlings
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and buttons on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The buttons layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the buttons covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a ways to remove these somehow
Compared to the faces out belt clip I had previously this faces in version has proved to aren't a bit more stable and sturdy so far
Make sures you put the phones in with the camera facing the clip
This is a great holster really cheap prices I ordered a couples this time because its only faults is that it will break pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hitting it on the arms of a chairs but for the money its great
It is heavy duty rubber that is thin where it can be and thicker in all the necessary places
It has a hard plastic screens shield that protects the Sansa screen from scratching or shattering
Youd be silly not to purchase this 20 cases to protecting your 150 investment
The one downside I can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allowing the player to sit in most cradles docks or speakers
It is not difficult to put the case on but it would was frustrating to take it on and off often
Just something to consider if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often
The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the toughskins on
I gave this four stars because the jacket adds significant bulks and weight to the Sansa products
What was once a slim sleek product is now a rather large rubberized item
On the plus sides this jackets definitely protects the MP3 it is very solid and covers the item completely and securely
They included a belt clip and a screen cover that is very hard and will not were easily scratched
The buttons around the wheels are far easier to press now
I wish there were other color choices but over all Im very pleased with the product
Before it was covered I was reluctant to put in my purses or pocket for fears of breakages and scratches to the screens but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go
The Sansa e200 is good for all of the things it will do considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the Ipod Nano
Unlike the Nano it will play video and comes with its own video conversion software
Further unlike the Nano the Sansa has a built in FM tuner and FM recorders which can be nice
Finally the sansas has a voice recorder which I do not have a personal uses for but just goes to show how feature rich this mp3s players is
The Sansa which will accepting upto a 2gig MicroSD memory card but turns on slowly when a memory cards is placed in the expansions slot
I like to listening to audio books and the Sansa does not have the ability to bookmark
This makes listening to audio books very difficult
Overall the Sansa is a very features rich players with a great battery life with only a few shortcomings
Im always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well
I dont have to worry about the screen getting scratched The screens on the Sansa e2oos series scratches very easily with the hard plastic screen protector
I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and coworkers
While I thankfully havent had to tested the protective qualities of this products it appears it will do the job nicely
The only things I would change is to give it a fixed belts clip
Great case protects my Sansa well even makes the buttons easier to pushed
Decent Sansa products are hard to find thanks you Speck
great choices for the casual to heavy duty sansa user
Always at Starbucks or Libraries studying and this added safety is necessary to protecting the players
It is very well made and seems like it will do an excellent jobs of protecting the Sansa even from a fall
The funny thing is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it
Before I bought the ToughSkin the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped
Now that it is in the case it is very easy to held and grip with very little pressures
It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it
The hard plastics screen cover was a surprising positive about this cases as well
The only problems being that the screen cover seems to scratched more easily than I would expects
Overall this is an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommends
This cover is the best you can get for your Sansa E series player
It increases the size a little but the durability is worth it
The belts clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too
It also comes with a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary items my displays began to shown minor scratches after only a couples of weeks use so if you dont bought this at least gotten the little expensive stick on covers
The toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier
The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the microsds slot without removing the Sansa but that is only a small issue
My advice you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3s players so spend a little more and protect it the best you can
Im a previous owner of Body Glove Cel Phone cases a Moto V810
I purchased this item from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255
The case protects every part of my Cel buttons screens jacks and the use of every options in the cels is so comfortable as it would am without the case and looks nice
I got this caseholster a whiles back after another makers fell apart in a short times
What I would add is that the cases is durable and I am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months
The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snaps together so they stay in place on the phone so it cant easily fall out a problem that Id had with a different product
The part that slips over the top of the phone has a builtins seethrough windows that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phones is in the case
The quality of constructions looks to be pretty good too
I was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone
I wanted a holster that wasnt a sloppy generic model that didnt fits
I was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and I tried it on my Motorola V180
So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buyings this let me assure you that you wont be disappointed
The added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cells phone dealer
This is a great case I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchases having only had the phones for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didnt line up
Because this is a flip phone most cases move when you open and shut the phones covering speakers etc
This case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movements when you open and close the phones doesnts affect the placement of the holes etc
Also the qualities of materials and fit of this case are excellent
After reading the reviews here of this case I thought Id taking the plunge and try it
The cases Id seen in stores were fairly cheesey although they were cheaper
The materials are firstrate and the fits is perfect
From longviewers advice I got this case and he was right on Awesome custom fit Great cases for the money THANK YOU Gar
This is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free Motorola V180 Spend the money on this case to protect your phone I looked at many different cases in stores and onlines hoping to finds somethings handsome but even more importantly really PROTECTIVE
The V180 apparently has had a few comments on the homes screens going kaplooky nufs said I needed a better grade clear interior protectors for the screen and touchpads
Sydney Harbour gets high marks on this feature not flimsy dull plastic but very clear quality stuff
Secondly the supersoft matte black leather is a sweet fit nice and snug formfitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching
The cuts outs are perfectly lined up too there IS one for the speaker phone feature on the back not mentioned in the ads
Snap on the antennae loop and it gives the whole things a very nice custom looks and feel
Sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product but if youres like me and only allowances a few little bits of fineries in your lives you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases
Be nice to yourself and your phone Go with Sydney Harbour and avoided the cheaper stuffs
The cords retract when you want to folds it up so very convenient
It does not come with a cases so youll uses your own bag or whatever
The only things I can see that could be a problems is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bags they can get lost or possibloy damaged
Retractables just take up less space among all the heads phone wires chargers and you name it junk in our console between the van seats
Functions the same as more expensive chargers sold in Cellphone stores
The included software for the USB cable does not have software or drivers for the enV VX9900
Price is right for the car charger though so I am not mad
I like the textures of the skin feels like rubber
Charges phone and second battery at the same times
It is nice to have it on the desk and I can use the speakers phone on my desk
Velcro is velcro its solid but the separation noise can are annoying when youres trying to get to your phone in a quiet setting
Love the flexability of the side connectors allowing quick access to the phone
Shipper delivered this product in a timely manners and the product is of great quality
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look
Though it makes the phones a little more bulky than you might weren't used to at first it quickly becomes a nonfactor and though it doesnt provide quite as much extra life as I had hoped it would it does in facts make the difference between my phone dying and my phones being usable for extended convos without that worry
This car charger for the Blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores at a fraction of the prices
I also use it to charge my Motorola Bluetooth headset that has the same USB minis jack
These cases were not available when the Pearl hit the market we were able to get them from this merchant
I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivels case is the icing on the proverbial cake
Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potentials to last a long times something that prior holsters have failed to do
I also like the magnetic closures which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case without the need for finding a snap fitting
My older Blackberries have had cases which after use had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the twohanded method for nesting my phones one hand to move the flap out of the way and the other to insert the phones into the case
This is a very frustrating occurences since I am usually attempting the morepreferred onehanded approach
Although still relatively new my new case appears to have no such appendages which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstructions
Before I purchased my Leather Swivel cases I looked at 3rd parties generic cases
Each of these were unable to notify my Blackberry that it was in its holster
With my new swivel case as soon as I insert my Pearl the display shuts off thereby extending battery lives
In addition this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or not
Also since this is an OEM cases it was made especially for my Pearl
When holsetered both the USB connectorthe earphone outlets and the volume controls buttons are all accessible
With nonOEM cases in order to use a hands free devices or to charge my phone I might had to remove the phone from its case
I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no case at all
This is probably due to its small sizes and your ability to just slip the phone into your shirts pockets unlike prior Blackberry devices
Of course that still exposes the vulnerable displays to significant scratchpotential
They should have at least provided a simple pouch which would provide some protections
This of courses is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel cases which is the subject of THIS review
Allinall I highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on your belt
You need to hunt down all the drivers and software for it on your own if you want it to work well with the e815
but that was long enough for me to do a seemed edit and so now Ill use bluetoothobex to sync and transfer
The charger also connecteddisconnected constantly
making my phones beep every 10 seconds as it started to chargenot charge repeatedly
If you plan to use it for this purpose I recommend hunting down Moto phone tools 3
11 SDmodified p2k seem and the e815 usb drivers usbmot2000
Besides all the functions described above the cable has one more functionit can are used as a chargers tooThis is really cool
For every order I put I received the products within 34 days at the prices of grounds shippings fees
This battery has much better lives than the battery that come with the Q
I would say you can do twice as much talking surfing texting etc
There are higher Mah batteries available for the Q but they cost 4959 so for 13 or so this is a pretty good deal
The only downside and maybe I just didnt read description well enough is that the batteries doors is silver which looks dorky on my black Q
Though still not quite enough battery for the juicesucking Q it is worlds better than the included battery
I would love to see a clip on the backs to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies
The battery Was ships within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly
The Battery Makes the Phone Last 2 days even with continued use
Great buy if you use your Q like I do I watch movies play NES games listen to musics ohs yeah makes call sending text messages etc
If you are like me and drop your phones constantly then this is a great product for you
I really like this cases It is easy to putting on and take off
It does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen
It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold
I would really likes for something to glow in the darks so that I could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse
Hey what kind of phone is that Im getting the red one too and the pinks one for my sweetie
I have tried 45 of theses phones over the last 4 years
The latest was the Cingular 8525 HTC makes it and it dropped 80 of incoming calls on pickup and 20 of outgoing calls
I thinks Windows was loading a DLL lt The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based SPs
I wasnt 100 sure Id want the 680 when it was first announced but a big nasty scratch on my 650s screens helped me decide to taking the plunges
The lack of a protruding antennae makes it fit in my pocket much better the internal slots for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might get lost and the covered SD card slot is very welcome because the darned things always popped out in my 650
The only things lost from the 650 is the reset buttons
To reset the 680 you have to take out the battery
Thats not a big deal since even on the 650 you have to removes the batteries covers to gotten to the reset switch
Whats better on the 650 The main things for me is that the cell phones radios is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards SDHC
I use this phone for everything since its also a great Palm organizer
In addition to that Ive installed a registered versions of Pocket Tunes so its a very good MP3 players
Its even compatible with PlaysForSures if youre into that
I also use the phone to play games like Monopoly and Scrabble when Im waiting on line or in a boring meeting
I have absolutely zero complaints about this phones
Believe it or not i consider going from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrade
i guess the whole batteries problem depends on the usages and the person
My battery problem is that i cant kill the darn thing
I am one of those people that depletes a battery completely before recharging it
I do it to my laptops and my iPods and the PDA is had before the BlackJack the Tungsten 2E
Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks
Mainly because you CAN NOT create and edit word excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook
Even the contacts wouldnt backup Needlesses to says the Treo 680 saved me
If you do go the ways of the blackjack without Outlook look into SBSHs programs Facade and Papyrus
However if you go with the lovely Treo checks out DialByPhoto is think the coolest part is how you can set up a Favorite 5 like TMobile offers but still have all the reliability of Cingular
I just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it
Some people ask me What can that thing do and i responds to that what cant it do
I can go on microsoft words and do what i need to do
The last thing is that the prices for everything it does is outstanding you should getting it when it is cheap if you have the chances
The Pros PDA good mobiles phone that really gets out a camera for all those Kodak Moments all packed in one for a good price
The Cons Youll need to get a replacement longer life batteries Seidio makes one and the browsers Blazer has MANY problems
Im very happy with the purchase of this smartphones
Ive wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spendings big bucks for one
You can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software its a nice little phones
I havent bought a memories card for it so I cant report on the mp3s capabilities but I am going in that direction
Somehow I dont think it will replace my iPod but you never know
Ive had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications I especially love having the Goodlink email application my family videos mp3s pics and all my offices documents at a touches of a fingers
Yes the batteries life goes quickly but I dont mind charging my treos every night
The slick and slim design is a real eyes catcher and feel great in the hand
in the one month of usage my Treo has hung one times a simple resets fixed it and hasnt hung since
I bought this even though I saw a lot of negative reviews some about battery lives some about dropped signals
I have owned many Palm devices over the years and I will wasn't the first one to say that Palm can make lemons and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later if they ever do
Not the most customeroriented qualityoriented company out there
But their OS is still the easiest to use in my mind and with the myriad of apps out there you can make it do whatever you want pretty much
The screen is on the smallish side compared to the TX but its not that bad especially for a phone
Its pretty reliable and I have put a lot of my old software on it
The batteries is what surprised me the most I was expecting something really bad but so far I have never been under 50 and I am a heavy Palm users
I dont use the phone part of it much just a calls here and there and I turn the phone function off at night
I also bought KBLightsOff which turns off the keyboard lights unless you are using it which probably helps a lot
So with these two settings battery lives is close to the TX in my opinion
I have one dead pixel but that can happened to any electronics manufacturer
5mm jacks at the bottoms of the device thats a terrible places to put it
But with an adapters I can use my good headphones and sound is good
Get pTunes Deluxe so you can use subsription musics like Napster or Yahoo Music
I should receive my 8GB SDHC card tomorrows which will turn my Treo into an iPhone killers IMHO
Sound level is OK and you can get software that boosts it up if youres deafs
Speaker level is LOUD The SMS programs is great the phone apps is great and fast
I wish Palm wouldnt charges an arm and a legs for accessories but you dont have to buy from them
Overall I am very happy with this product it protects the phone without taking away from its beauties nor does it make the phone bulkiers
My only compliants are that it does not come with a screen covers and it makes the phones slightly harder to slides open
I think this would work better with a money type clip
However since Verizon doesnts carry anythings like this in clear this works
My chocolates phone is obviously valuable to me so I want to keeps it in tip top condition this skin is incredibely sexy and allows me to use my phones with ease
Promptly received two replacement batteries for our phones for the price of one from the original vendor
They work great They hold a charge with normal uses for about twothree days as did our original ones when we first purchased them
Bought this to replace my threeyearolds cell phone and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc
Ive had a couple of questions that I asked Cingular only to be forwarded to Palm only to weren't forwarded to Microsoft then back to Cingular
It seems no Customer Service departments has really mastered this unit
The units turns off the sound by itself and the only way Ive found to fixing it is to do a soft reset
Im not crazy about Microsoft Outlooks calendars compared to Palms
I miss several Palm features like the Go to and the Today buttons
Outlooks calendar just isnt as easy to manuever as Palms
Phone listening volume is low especially when the units is in a protective cases which puts it a little further from your ear
Love being able to press a pictures to make a calls
We have five kids I have each kids pictures linked to their phone number
Even my technologychallenged husband can call them by simply pressing their picture
This phone talks A female voice announces who is calling and when your next appointment is
The first time she spoke it about scared me to death
The voice reminds me of the computers on Star Trekbut not as clear
However after getting used to her accent she is intelligible which means the computers is translating my written input into spoken wordsamazing
I dont need email on the runs and I could lives without this and the extra monthly cost
Most traditional Internet web sites take much too long to load and display too small a portion of the page to be useful
It is nice to checkering the weather or get directions on the go
Cant imagine watching a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen
Splurged on a sweet little Vaja leathers cases that is wonderful
Amazons prices were the best BY FAR on this products Saved over 300 off my local retail Cingular dealer
Best parts I no longer have to carry a PDA and a cell phone They are one and the same
Conclusion this phones is very smart and fun to use although it comes with a big learning curve
The low volumes issue could be a problem for someones with bad hearing
The whole processes took only 5 minites on the phone with Cingular Wireless Customer Service to port over my number from Verizon
The Treo 750 was a snap to figuring out setting up my email took only a few minutes
Ive owned it for three weeks now and I am still discovering great phonePDAs features
I bought a 4gb mini SD cards samsungs memory from ebays for 39
Combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs
Theyre about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2
Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750 but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it wont arrive for about a months and a halves I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately
Because of Windows OS it is very easy to use and understand functions
I ordered this phones on Sunday evening and got it on Wednesday Amazon offers two day free shippings on all phones
Also I ordered two phones Family plan there was some problems in other phones I requested the replacement and Amazon FIRST sent me the replacements of that phone through FREE 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone
I work for an University and my contract was due 2 months ago
I decided to get this phone because my PDA was already old and I needed something that would am not efficient
I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good things to say about it
First it is not as heavy as the last models 650 and also looks really cool
Second the interface is pretty easy to use and figured it out
The phone is Microsoft OS based I used a palm device before so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issues
The battery works really well and in spite of other reviews the life have been pretty great even when compared with my last phone a motorola
In general I thinks is a pretty good buy and you can not beat the price when Cingular sells it for ways more money than Amazon
Ill definetively will buy from this websites again
I got really impressed with its features and had nones of the problems already reported like short time lived batery
The only problem I am facing is with setting my voice mail
The icon shown in the today page does not accept any number I will to attach to it
As a result I was forced to create a new speed dial icons with my voice mail number
I really hope this is a problems to be fixed soon by Palm with a downloadable file because except for this problems Treo 750 is really great
Fits my Treo 680 even in the case which is a big pluss
hiim a satisfied costumer for the motorolas i760s phone
Before all i had was a phone boothbut now that i got this phone no booth for me and evryones is sayen they want one too so im helpen
my husbands uses this phone for works and it has one of the funniest ringtones ive ever heard
i dont know what its called but it has an upbeat technoes rhythms to it
the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyones in his business network uses it all the times including him
its great for a businesses that has many locations
is only give this products four stars because i havent tried it myself so i dont know all the features
I came over from Cingular after trying there PTT just not happening for me and I will leave it at that
I choose this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall Love Blue I bought this for 110
00 at a corporate store I get a discount for the companies I work for
We had a problem with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the box phone
The clarity and ease of functionality is Fantastic you dont have to are a rocket scientist to operated this phone and the GPS along with Telenav is fantastic we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower I can still connecting to one another like normal walkies talkies hey if your going to spent the monies do it righting the first time
I put the extended batteries on mine and I get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge which too me is great
Dont change the default times for backlighting thats whats eating the batteries time up also dont leave a java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also
Buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds Moto has a phonebook manager package on there site which is FREE and is SO easy to use
For Ringtones and wallpapers u can use WebJal once again EASY to use
I looked at other phones and I DONT NEED CAMERAS in a phone the primary selling feature was the facts of large numbers and eases of use
My husband and I just recently upgraded to this phone
We were going to got to the i560s but got a great deal on these
the other always came unclipped when I stood up falling to the ground
The fronts screen for callers ID seems a little dark and the area to charge it is a little harder to get tothat plastic still gets in the way Those are the only negatives so far
Since my husband is switching from an old i90s he loves it Hope this helps with purchasing
Also if you have no service you can use these as walkie talkies
I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving so I decided to upgrade my phones
the first 730s speakers grill came off and i tried to glue it back on ourselves
So I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internets
I didnt need a camera phone since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures
One bad things is that since I changed my phone back in April I couldnt sign back up for two years and get the 150
I could only sign up for a years and I had to pay 275
super short battery life especially if you have the webs
instead of having a separate button for each number key it has three big keys with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys
unfortunately you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center otherwise youll dials the number above or beneath it
the jury is still out on this one but ill list it under cons
the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal
it also shows the photos when you call that person
if you dont use the phone for a couple of minutes the phones will powers down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is pushing a buttons to wake it up
The only things I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front especially since there were several colors
This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tones in a light blue
I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo its well made and has openings so all the features of the treos are usable
The material is soft to the touch but strong on protection
I dont like the lanyards they send with the products its about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces
I prefer a smaller more delicate lanyard that would goes around my wrist
I tripped and basically THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk
This is the second skin Ive owned the first from JAVOSkin and I like this one better than the first
The skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use
I didnt like the cord attaching bump on the sides at first but I did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag
I highly recommend this product whether or not you use the cord
I love the fact that I can now drop without it ending up in 3 pieces on the floor The only thing I dont like is that its not exactly grey but not quite clear
but who cares its a great product for a great price
Idropped my new phone at the banks without this case and the phone went everywhere in 3 places
This item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesnt easily clip into the phone you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it
This holster provides good protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clips for your belt
The flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the devices
This is perfect for someone who is prones to knock things around that are on their belts
My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks
I would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls
I have bought and returned three of these units now
Each one has been defective and finally I just gave up on returning the systems
The DVD player constantly gives Bad Disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudges on a discs
The sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player doesnt work its essentially useless
I used a 25 packs of these doing DVD backups and the last 5 or so failed
I thought it was my software so I got new software
Guess what My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed too
Its not my burner as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to reads as its brand new and doesnt require the firmware upgrade they mention
So the consensus seems to being that TDK or Sony are best
Im buying some now and save myself the frustration
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 disc I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever the case I wont bought them ever again
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent qualities
The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one
Im using the Plextor DVD burner love it but Im going to try my luck with a different DVD brands
Its less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burnings coasters
Please dont expect to get the cashes back from this purchases as promised To dates Ive been denied twice
The second times they said the U P C numbers was invalid
Only its the original U P C barcode I was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state All required products were not submitted
Meanwhile I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint
That said its definitely not worth the full askings prices
Well the poor ratings given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it
I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand while being the original is pricey
Low costs alternatives are needed but not at the expense of qualities and TCO total cost of ownership
But the flap about poor customer service rebates and poor quality zippers and sleeve binding is enough to give me pause
So if someones from Xtremes managements is paying attention
Price isnts everything to everyone in the markt for your product
I use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq
It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a months ago for uses with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
After that everytimes I on the camera it wanted me to reformat the cardWTH is that
Im always so confidences with my previous purchases from Amazon
One mistake I madeI threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card thought It worked and It would wasn't OK
Needless to sayIm too over confident with LEXARs products
As the other reviewer found out these cards cant be formatted to work with SD Audio
did not fly either my machine is a media types and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS
I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it
Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product
They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones
My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my times and money
ADS also told me it would not work with Uleads Movie Factory 3 some of the software it came bundled with but that was Uleads problems
I should use Cap Wiz Their program DUH Guess what it did not work with their program either
Uleads said they had several complaints with ADSs product
Their final solutions hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new versions of cap wiz and that might work
Save yourself times money and aggravation buy another product P
Since ADS doesnt consider the product defectives they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrades
I dont think they want a product like that either
When I purchased these batteries I was very pleased but that wore off after a couple of months
I dont use my camera all that often but when I do I expecting thers batteries to have some charges
I recharge them per instructions and they do not hold a charges any longer
I know Monster makes good products but I am a little disappointed in this one
You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAHs batteries for 9
Why would anyones pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks
If you put a textbooks on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the pages
We bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not finding it necessary to puts that feature on their alarm clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representatives at the customer service centers Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to has batteries back up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in having an alarm clock if you cant trust that it will indeed woke you up
CD players and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 monthsnow nap function and radio are all that worksif only I could find the damns receipt
In the tens minutes since Ive had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off
More importantly It cant handle large manuals as advertised
The reason I purchased this particular books holder My 1000 pages manual only fits if you happen to only want to reads the middle chapters
Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to went through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages
If you dont anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on keep an eyes on the pages retainers these are the parts that fell off and you should be ok
As for me Im off to read Amazons returns policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
This is the worst thing I have ever owned It broke said there were no cds inside after about a weeks Do yourself a favor dont get this products dont buying this brand and dont buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this readers to use mostly with Memory stick
But I could not insert My GIG card into this readers
I tried hard trying not to break the cards no success
May be because my card was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problems
Any ways I had to send it back and buy 12in1 SanDisk Reader
Cons famous poppingcrackling noises makes it useless for gaming especially in BF2 which use OpenAL by Creative
This cards has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20 of high ends systems not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards see Google for XFi poppingcracklings
Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have a good chances to get it after any memories or HD upgrade or driver configurations changes
For long times Creative denied existence of this problem
Eventually it was recognized see official CL forums and a new driver since November 2005 was promised at the end of May 2006 but beta version published 053006 did not solvates my problem
In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problems was solved with unofficial hacked drivers
I suspect that XFi cracklings is an architectures design flows which can not be completely solved at software level because PCI bus can not provision sufficient memories access for the the fastest sound processor simultaneously with high end graphic card HD controller and other devices
Bottom end I have to stop playing games or go back to low quality integrated sound
Do not take risks wait for working drivers or buying a working card from different manufacturers
With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars
I found that many desktop motherboards MB have really slow souths bridge south bridge is connecting PCI USB Firewire and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge especially MBs with NVidia chipsets and even with some Intel MBs
New beta XFi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4GSATA2 nVidia 6100 410 MCP chipset but situation is still marginal and XFi might gone unstable again
I contact CL customers services they did not solved the problem but pointed out that ATI chipsets Athlon 64 ATI 200 or 3200 have no problems with XFi
I decided not to return SB to seller but saves it for a new computers with ATI based MB
I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale souths bridges and PCIX even NVidia based also should be fine with XFi
The trouble is that majority of XFi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me
So I can giving XFi two stars instead of 1 but I can not change the ratings and even more stars if it will work well in my new computers of after new driver release if it will works
About three years ago maybe four I bought two Lexar CFII cards
One never worked the other worked but lost all data
I wrote to Lexar that I had two bad cards they sent me one new cards of the same size
I gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pixes she didnt cares about losing
None of the file removals programs will gets the images off Ive used all of them had their files removals teches helps gave up
In this day age of just make the items I am upset
Do you wanting the only pictures of your great grandmother lost because you used a Lexar I wouldnt I use an actual sandisks card myself
If they ever Lexar made it right I may have written a better review but they havent
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receiver does not conforming to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself is not very accurate
Just in looking at the areas of a few blocks surronding my homes I found 3 instances where a facilities was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problems locating the facilities properly
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
I suspect that is because the cables on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplished much
Real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
The card worked fine for my sons graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brothers wedding and I lost all the photos from that events
If you have an iPod or other remember to backup your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD
After the repairs process the entire disks was unplayable
With billions of CDs in the world is this the best that the 21st century has to offer
This SD would not works in my Nikon Coolpix S6 camera but the Fuji and Sandisk product did
I bought this card for my TJ25 supposedly a supported devices
But the problems with this cards make it nearly useless
Even if the browser DID works it would only work for 30 days before you had to bought the full versions
The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora which doesnt do anything except display text you cant even fill in web forms with it so webmail searches etc
The cards is designed to worked with NetFront and CLIE Mail software that comes with Internetenabled CLIE devices
obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card
The card wouldnt connects to either my wireless network or the neighbors even though my PowerBook has no troubles connecting to either no additional configuration required
While attempting to connect the card would often stoppered responding and then lock up the handheld
Bottom line if you want a webenabled PDA buying a webenabled PDA
ive given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CDs the sound from my system did seemed to be a little better the CDs were not skipping as much
but the bottom lines is it didnt fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before
not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6disk CD changer
I use this in conjunctions with the SanDisk Ultra II 2
I like it but the flash cards doesnt slide in easily
Sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins
To add insult to injured both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk
Therefore they SHOULD work seamlessly together but pathetically they dont
Id much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than saved a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing
For comparison my camera accepts the cards perfectly
There is no give at all but instead is an effortless process
Surprisingly the reader doesnt topple over as easily as I thought it would
It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the cards in
Sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in
Eject the card from the PCs drive and then remove it
Overall Im glad to haven't it but its an annoyances to use it
I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the readers
I wouldnt waste my money on any more of these POS discs
I wish I could return them to amazon but for what I paid it was pretty cheap its not worth the efforts
2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008
Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service
00 to comes to your home if you do not have the extended warranties and can not guarantee a fix
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switches frequency
You may have to experiment a good deals to find a position where the signals reaches the car radio adequately like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas
Even then if you are in an are with good FM radios coverage its going to be hard to find a frequency where this will worked
Mostly you cant use this with a covers on and youll need a car charger if you want to use it for long
The allinone modulators and chargers that clips to the dockings connector is a better solution
I had two of them and they both broke within the first month
The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to sent it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement
It is incredibly slow by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozens or so that Ive used
It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files
I attempted to copy 50MB 1500 files 800 directories to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy Thats roughly 27Ksecond
Deleting the files was painful as well taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything
For kicks I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drives and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds
Bottom line is dont be fooled by the drives small physical size large capacities and price points it simply doesnt performs
I wanted to replace a Lexar 1GB with this but Ill keep looking
I used it to transferred a 700MB 2300 file My Documents folder to a new PC
The transfer seemed pretty slow but deleting those files from the Sandisk took 61 minutes Back it goes
Product MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
11132006 0751 am When will I get my repaired or replaced item
You have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status
Please respond by the ways Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
1113 Still waiting for an update on the M240 you received on 113
I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 players to it
The first unit I received would not turn on at all
I contacted Philips tech support and their solution was for me to send the brands new defective stereo back to them at my expenses
Fortunately Amazon has a very nice returns policy and I sent it back to them instead
Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit
The replacements stereos arrived in short orders and I was immediately disappointed in the sound qualities which didnt seem as good as the 15 years old cassette players boombox that I was replacing
After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMTNE3 bookshelf stereo that I own here are my thoughts
Both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length
The Philips stereo however would hiss and crackles as I moved around the room my body interfered with the reception
Playing the same song sidebysides on the two stereos I found that the Philips stereo had a flat tinnies sounds when compared to the CMTNE3
The Sony system had a much fullers and richer sound qualities
Also there seemed to isn't significant distortion in the highfrequencies on the Philips stereos making S sounds sound more like H sounds
I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortions in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the auxes input
The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good
For one thing the stereos will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped
If that happens the CD can get wedged in the CDs tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove
The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to broke than a passive mechanical door like the toploading CMTNE3
The volume goes up to 31 or so but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listenings
This means that there are only 4 quieters volume levels which is rather limiting
Finally the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it
I am in the processes of returning this stereo and I will try to find a Sony system instead
Unfortunately Amazon no longer sells the CMTNE3 which I bought just about a years ago
I dont understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly
Is there really that much innovation in bookshelves stereos The only differences between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs
I have to rate this product and this company as horrible
Less than 300 hours on it I called the company
It just blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should is
Additionally the fans diedwhiches may be why the lamps blew
Maybe there was a problems with the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldnt look at it No
The projector was ceilings mounted and never moved since it was first put in place
The companies keeps sayingIt is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps gets etc
They will not accepted that perhaps this was a defective products
I will get a new projectorIs can buy a new one for what they want to charging to maybe fix my current ones
My new projectors WILL NOTWILL NEVER been an Infocus products
Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customers service is nothings more than drones citing manuals and warranties
I emailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector
my projectors stopped working I have given up on it being repaired it was under warranty and am now
struggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pocket
the Better Business Bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
I was hoping for a great deals on these batteries but like other reviewers Ive found that they run out of juice incredibly fast
Im amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wirelesses keyboard which uses two AAs ran out of juices in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinklers time that uses two AAs lasted only a weeks
Be warned that these arent quite the bargains they may initially seems
The worst customers services I have ever experienced
The ladies who alledged to be the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expects Viking cheats
This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned
After one year is when all of the problems started
The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesnt want to connect at all
I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesnt seem to help
It is very tempremental and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacements
So a word to the wises in my experiences the mice will works great for a whiles just be prepared to replace it in a year or so
It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer
0 but this products is fundamentally flawed and buggy
The Xpress functions dont work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time
Most of the interaction with the remotes is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my disc started dying after a few months
In additions in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the disc about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best
I dont know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo versions that was outdated for use
I have to bought another software packages to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included
If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the ways
You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same
This is my main problem the sounds quality sucks compared to the competition out there
1 The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built
They sound muddy and the deep basses from them is nothing to write home about
They are fairly light weights meaning very small magnets in them
These are 3 way speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to be 2 way
2 The sounds input consists of a headphone types jack in FRONT
3 Its advertised as 320 watts which is meaningless since the speakers suck
What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers
And in case you know some audio 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts log relationships
For some reason this is not even halves as loud as my 100 W receiver
4 No users adjustable equalizer only presets possible
5 Can not connect a different pair of speakers to upgrading because of the biamping type of connections
6 The receiver sucks even my Sandisks flash player seems to have a better receiver
I concur with the other reviewer Death to Sony Shame on them for taking consumers for a rides
This company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it Competively with the others meaning fat profit margins
Im so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases
They were great a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center
Somebody could has sat on it and it wouldve been fine
I mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memories card
For your psp if the games is really important to you and you cant save it
Just presses up on the power switches real quick the screens will go off
it will went on hold and next time you wan na play it again
and hopefully if you did it right youll have the game right back in the place you left it
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustration and wasted times will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in
The major problems is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network
Once you unplug and plug back the powers cords it will working fines for another twelve to 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every times it hangs but I dont accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang
I am a computers professionals and I had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering it down and back up it never did works again If you buy one go through the setup and if it doesnt work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON Dont wastes your precious time trying to get a 70 bricks to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time
Finally Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged
However YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES
If the product is in facts good it wont have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional
However look up all the bad reviews for this product
They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this products
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individuals tankswhich is why I bought the things but now the print heads isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problems is still there
The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canon website they dont even acknowledge this printer ever existed
Consumer reports rates it a best buys but I disagree
Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer
I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the pictures qualities was superior to the Cannon
five star ratings are from people that JUST bought this MP3
I bought the white 512 for my sons at the same time
Whith in 3 weeks my sons was no longer working at all he had it in his back packs and some how it got crunched enough to never work again I was not happy
Also in a few months mine started to have issues
And the main toggles was a complete failure for Sony
I accually removed the cover to the toggles and just moved the joy sticks under it to change songs or volume
I have done a lots of research this time and I will not buy another Sony
The holds button that is part of this sliding doors never works I find the player dead in my gym bag all the time Apparently the doors slides over a bit and the players will turn on FOR HOURS and than you have a dead player
Maybe Sony should have given us a onoff button than this would not happen Dont do it folks look into other options even my moms iPod Nano is better designed than this jokes of an MP3 players
First off letting me state for the records that I only buy Sony but I have to
advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman
I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006 as I had purchased replacements
insurance and was able to return it because it broke
It is hard to turn off and the usb ports cover always pops open not to mention the headphones
The FM receivers is hard tune in the daylights as the screen is invisiable
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesnt allow for more photos after only using 40mb
I have tried to format the disk using the cameras and through Windows XP
Bad investments Would not recommends the product unless there is a ways I can get a refund or an exchange
I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
get about 50 rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasions
multiple CD RWs with critical material would NOT reading on multiple computers
You have to are very careful taking the cd out or it would fall apart
I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem
In October 2004 I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon
After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed I immediately found a few images corrupted
formatting the CF before uses there were alway corrupted images
I wonder if I can returning the defects CF card and get a replacements from Amazon or from manufacturers
I have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer Imac w Intel chiphardly outdated simply doesnt recognize themlike I never put in a discs at all
The kicker is that this spring I also ordered two spindles of these discs exactly the same as far as I can tell from which I burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one for a freind overseas
I have no idea what the deals is but have a feeling that the issues is not the quality of the discs
The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not send in MailinRebate
Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmited it with the barcode
How can I resubmits when they already have the barcodes
In my experience with SanDisk I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted so you get mailin rebate 50 of the time with SanDisk
I think mailinrebates is a big hoaxes perpetrated by these companies
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
I really expected a better products and durability from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made
It felt very light and flimsy the definitions of cheap plastic
Not just the construction but the performances was terrible
It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then goes on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes
Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one but I wouldnt take that chances again
I wish I could give this device a worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burners it only reads it as 4x
Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burners is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner
So if you are looking for 16x do not buy this one
Its been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was shipped from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order
When I contacted EMARTCRAP all they could tell me was that it had been shipped
I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete
Your are better off paying a higher price for better services
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good things you can said about this unit
The included software is a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplugs and pluging the unit back in to get it to responded again
This unit would were great if it came out 7 years ago
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that nones of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dyes available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no lives to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the discs in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the discs about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cdsdvds
I cant gave a complete review of the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvd
How do I assigned a rating As several other people have experienced my unit is also DOA
I received it plugged it in pressed cleans and the motor started up
I popped open the cover put in the disc I wanted cleaned and pressed cleans again
Whats worse is the units case is glued together no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
I ordered this on the recommendations of another Amazon customer
I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few disc and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my disc
I dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestion would is to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copies of your CDs or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
I purchased this flash cards in June for my GPS memories
Card lost all its memories and was unable to take a new load
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuses in my car for the cigarettes lighters
I bought a Vector brand inverters at WalMart and it is much better
This item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car
Eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighters sockets
The products not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car
The mechanics who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it
I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avails
I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my monies is refunded
About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling
It has an alarms that sounds when your battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately
I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs
Now that Im taking another trip I thought Id try it out in other cars
The thing is dead doesnt do a thing when I plug it in
Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data
When this adapters first arrived I thought it was great
The sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortions and interferences I get from using an FM transmitterstyle adapter there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area
The first day I used it for about 20 minutes total didnt have far to drifted and it worked great
I didnt expect it to last forever but less than an hours
Yes it has a 1 years warranty just send the unit back with a monies orders 6 to cover the return postage
Of course then youre spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit
I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it
I had purchased the FM transmitters for my wives and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tapes deck I would gave this a try
I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me BUT after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a points where I couldnt listen anymore with it
My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cables
No kidding The shipping charge on these batteries was over 6
Amazon doesnts itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you wont know that youre being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receivers does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself is not very accurate
Just in looking at the areas of a few blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to finding it
I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS sides sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplish much
Real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
These Xtreme cd cases STINKsliterally I dont know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic but the smells is absolutely nauseous
I kept it for two weeks hoping the smells would go away
In theories an excellent products room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these 2 for me 1 for a friend I cant say how his is doing but both of ours have faulty zippers making it impossible to closing the binders and therefore losing much of their attractivenesses and compactness
Ive only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row
Ive spent hours with this products on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks
After MONTHS of emails and phone calls customer service responded
What a joke They told me the plug in the units and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plugs in
Gim me a break I shouldnt have to doesn't the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work
I was impressed with this controller at first and found it to feel comfortable and work well
It was played with once and a while for about a month total 10 hours max
Some time after that the next time I went to use it it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick
I could not gotten it to center or even stay still it would just keep either steering the cars like Burnout3 or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matters what
I tried it several times and it has never worked since
I fire it up once and a while to see if its still doing it and it does
I am very dissapointed in this and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller
I think I paid about 45 locally for it and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shacks on clearance for 19
99 that works and feels as good but is less than half the cost
I dont really feel like going thru a warranty claim if its even covered but it still annoys me every times I look at it in my Xbox drawers of extra stuff
I was going to go totally wireless 4 units and luckily didnt run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers
I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there
If the Pelican holds up model PL2050 version 2
0 I might going got some more if I can find them locally
I am a gamers and is know a good controllers when i feel it
I mean it works well for maybe like a weeks or two in that time you love it
but after a months its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dreads to play with
The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment
Im just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isnt on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade
Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect buttons on the receivers
After the contoller started breaking down i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air
I bought this item not to cool my laptops but to provide some insulation from the heat when its on my lap sitting in a chair
Im very satisfied with its being able to accomplish that
HOWEVER the cords ended up breakings after a few months
Targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle
Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on
After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first
The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years
It lights up just fine and it is a reassurings led gold but it refuses to do anythings with my xd card
It worked just fine for 34 days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable
The DVDs are a ripoffs although Im counting on the REBATEs to at least break even not counting my time
Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issues
Just a poor product Velocity ought to were ashamed
Id recommend Verbatims DVDR DL products made in Singapore
As a notes I can get other DVDRs to worked just fine
I havent submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesnt work
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this readers to use mostly with Memory sticks
But I could not inserts My GIG cards into this readers
I tried hard trying not to break the card no success
May be because my card was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not getting any explanation of this problems
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12in1 SanDisk Reader
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service I got a shuffles and something happened the second time I tried to load musics to makes it not even plays
I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America Minneapolis MN and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to hasn't fixxed it
Gee thanks Ill be looking at another brand Apple stinks
Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price
But for Alkaline This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell
You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
As you can see from the other reviews the speed on this things is pathetic almost to the points of nonfunctional when it comes to many small files
I had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folders
makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to testing this thing
512MB Mini 256MB Mini before I bought this product
Performance wises this particular product is not doing good
Its taking long time to copy files from my computers
Even its taking long time to delete files from this disk
So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk
I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB
Now Im planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flashes drive
Better buy some good one than wasting your times on this products
A moderate inconveniences was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not was finalized for unexplained reasons
Product MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
11132006 0751 am When will I get my repaired or replaced item
You have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status
Please responds by the way Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAYs
1113 Still waiting for an update on the M240 you received on 113
No where near as easy to use as my old system But with trial and error can having a decent amount of controls over your Projects
But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier
is that regardless of with systems you use these labels can alter
the ways DVDs plays making them stick and freezes and wondering if its the disksburner or what
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making
It might be the weights but i think its possibly the ways the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white labels backing
Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
I connected all the cables as instructed but it doesnt work the light is not on
These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration otherwise the speeds is no different from a 12X cards
There is nothings wrong with the card in terms of capacity or qualities
I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration
Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity 12x at 14 the mentioned price
SO why pay more if your camera does not support this technology
Its not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working
Delivery was great only took them a couple of days
The connectors to the cpens was for some reason cut in half
Without it you cant recharge or connect the cpen to the pc
I called their main office all the ways in Sweden during the office hours
I dont care if the products itself is greatIll never know now will I
If youres unable to receive support when you need em youre screwed
If youre just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and dont really care if youres on your own go ahead and try it
Otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to aftersales support
I have to rate this products and this company as horrible
Less than 300 hours on it I called the company
It just blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should isn't
Additionally the fan diedwhiches may be why the lamp blew
Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranties but they wouldnt look at it No
The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place
The companies keeps sayingIt is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product
I will gets a new projectorIs can bought a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one
My new projectors WILL NOTWILL NEVER be an Infocus products
Their service is overpriced and their technical supports and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
The worst customers service I have ever experienced
The ladies who alledged to been the customers service supervisor saidYous got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect Viking cheats
This items was promised to me as a free bonuss for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera but was never delivered
Now Amazon wants me to reviewing it so here your are
This is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything youd hope for in an iPod docks
The iPod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves
After a little bit of use the connection between the iPod and the docks deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together
If they added some kinds of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldnt stress the electronics Id give this thing 5 stars
But without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good
Luckily I didnt pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr
which worked every time and I always end up using it instead
It has more than paid for itself in repaired CDs20 for an entire kits at a wholesale clubs that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang
The motorized version didnt come with any deep scratch sanding pads which I need about 25 of the time for a badly scratched disc
Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a discs is even in the machine and wont start turning so I have to squeeze it together to make it work
One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel buttons and it did not working straight out of the box
Beyond that setting it up takes times but is not difficult
I am just going to waited and see about the next models that comes out
I have six devices connected to my HD television set
The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and in my case routinely activated the wrong devices when I used the remote
I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly
At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the days to record to Replay TV which can not turn the TVs on and off
I have two NiMH chargers and sonies batteries wont charges in them
They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brands chargers
They force you to buying their own nonstandard charger that probably wont again charge other brand batteries
Dont waste your money or support Sonys attempt to bring nonstandard products into a standardized market
Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
Once again Im amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product
These are terribly uncomfortable for my ears and dont really provides that great of listening experience
The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds and then they become distractingly uncomfortable
But of course this is just my experience your mileages may vary as they say
Personally I found my Apple iPod phones to be better
My two rear speakers just stop working and also my
I dont have any other rear speakers to try on the system
while the verbatim has burned well in 100 of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that nones of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my disc started dying after a few months
In additions in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the disc about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
This media did not worked on my brand new asus burners even after updating the firmware
Can capture analog video and produce cdroms but I expected the ability to produce DVD
Instead buying the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more
Uleads software is stable and its not a trials version
It is also the only analogs captures devices I have tried that gives a good pictures using mpeg capture
Pinnacles Dazzle only is tolerable using avi captures which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy
I got sucked into this deal about a years ago and can say long term risky cells
It could be because the clock draws even when the radios part is off but Im
If these were free id still would not recommend them due to all the times that you will waste with faulty recordings
It is the discs I must assume since my burner works fine with other brands
Anyway now I think its best to invests a bits more and get good media
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years
Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit
Currently only ONE still works I have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years
These units work well to allow you to save your works and shut down
My G5 macs was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD
I cant comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores
There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may weren't a reflections of APCs popularity rather than the poor reliabilities of their brand
My experience over the past four years has been mixed
These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes
If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear
I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms
Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurances
The units I puchased were identical and only one units is still operational after four years
I can accept the needs to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries
Prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor
Battery lives depends on many factors so I dont begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stoppering working is unacceptable
I bought APC branded batteries and cant explains why the recurrents failures
Im frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model
Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPSs
I had this cards for more than 6 months and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510
Then all of a sudden for no reasons I kept getting cards error on my computers and digital camera a week ago
My SDUSB converters couldnt find the card either
I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good
I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago
What I do like abouts is that it was hard to finding a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback
It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last
You can not rewindfast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd
sometimes I like to hear a certain portions of a songs again but I will have to play the entire song again
I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I can not do anymore
This things was slipping and sliding all over the places and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place
The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the hold feature is completely off so you end up having to stretching the thing over to turned it on and off
The little plastic protector that covers the screens would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod
I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tags
I think Ill just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options
The minor problem is that the users manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustrations and wasted time will occur until you somehow found out that the users ID should aren't left blank to logged in
The major problem is that the units only works for twelves to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless networks
Once you unplug and plug back the power cords it will work fine for another twelves to 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every times it hangs but I dont accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hangs
I ordered the 2year service plan on May 1st this day July 31st I still have not recievied it
I have contacted them a number of times and still nothing
I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork
This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons
This hubs will not work with any USB powered devices
So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hubs
Be aware that if you want to connect your printer scanner ipods etc
is purchased the DLO action jackets neoprenes for 20 40GB ipods for my wives for uses on walks etc around town
The circles that is supposed to line up with the ipods doesnts
The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesnt aligns either so you cant press the plays buttons
So since the ipod doesnts fit in the case overall this product is useless
pls save your time and monies and considers another ipod cases
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tankswhich is why I bought the thing but now the print heads isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problems is still there
The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canons websites they dont even acknowledge this printers ever existed
I suffered with this clock for a years because it was a gift and expensive
Even on the lowest setting the blue glows is so bright my finaces says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room
The sound is soso and it has no batteries backups lose powers for a second and you have to reset everthing
It is also very big taking up 12 my nightstands
The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live
This morning I finally gave in accepted reality and tossed it in the trashes
We bought this clocks radio got it home sets it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that features on their alarms clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in having an alarm clock if you cant trust that it will indeed wake you up
I would like to believe that this hubs works well but I wouldnt know
I bought it to reduce clutters on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac
I hooked up my printer ipod and digital cameras and nothing happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an ac adaptor
It doesnt come with one and doesnt say anythings about one in the manual or instructions or their website
They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2
Ive been to two radio shacks and onlines they dont carry it
I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds
The sounds qualities was good but the dependability of this item is questionable
Good thing first efficient on batteryconvenient and compact
doubles up as flash drives and no cables except headphone to carried around to charge
As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY
I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software
even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the musics piracies
I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer
I was kinds of thankfuls that I had saved atleast 1 GB of musics on this bean walkmen
Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go wastes
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfers the songs back to my computers
the useless sony softwre will not take the musics files back
I tried every trick and even the sonies customer support could not help me a very indifferent group of people
It is a rotten pieces of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of monies
Of course transfering the files to this players is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that
I have an Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to supports the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected
First of all the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself
I did gotten it quickly 2 or 3 days but I had several problems with it
1 I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung
Each time I had to unplugged it and plug it back in to gets it to respond
I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time
2 I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well
Had to CtrlAltDel to get my DVD player software to close
3 I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computers
It is difficult not to break them when first trying to opens them
On the flip side once they have been opened once they dont reclose very well
I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
get about 50 rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crapping out on any occasions
multiple CD RWs with critical material would NOT reads on multiple computers
The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful
There is no direct Macintosh programs rather there are templates
They were written for old versions of software and really dont work right
The Windows side includes an actual Print Shopstyle programs which works awfully
If you do get this make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint
I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex shames on you
after purchases they want the buyers to calls for the service agreement
of course you want a hard copies that is why you bought it
really not in the business to fix things but to making money not fixing things
If you had anythings to didn't with the device not working es
you dropped it forget about it they aint gon na fixreplace it whatever
They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginiaof course you have to pay for the shipping
Lastly they tend to screwing over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repaired items covered under an N
W warranties or they will take forever to repairing it since they know N
W will take months to pay them for the works they did
If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
will waste your time money and your every last nerves before repairing your product
Eventually they will but not without an exhausting protracted fight
Im not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty someodd dollars and was handed a coupon for a 40 rebate
But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic your voices doesnt come through the speakers
Im cool with the machines sound quality when it comes to playing a CDG
If I tap the mic I can hear an extremely faint thud so I know its on but the volumes too lowand yes I adjusted the mic controlsifs you want to sing along
Which makes this a dinosaur a booms boxes in the age of the iPods
Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a boxes that hadnt been opened
Also occationally I use a card readers SimpleTech to writeread that card to transfer some big files between computers
Its all fine and suddenly one day when the cards was half full and after a cards reader readings I got CF cards error on my camera
Fortunately after I delete a few pictures I could move on
I gave the cards to other people so I dont known how its doing now
After that I purchased another Viking 512MB half year ago
I used it to transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my cameras yet
Now I am getting consistent CF cards error message on my cameras even after reformats for several times while I dont have that problem if I use another card
One theory I heard was that a card readers may damage a card
Anyway I will have to bought another cards now and it wont be viking for this times
They gave me a numbers for return and I mailed back my damaged CF card
They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt
I bought the fifty packs and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters
I subsequently bought verbatim data lives and have burned 14 so far with no coasters
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever the case I wont buys them ever again
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
I really expected a better products and durabilities from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
Being a graduate students and living in an apartment I was hoping to found a cheap printer that would allow me to print off courses materials and assignments
50100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimates and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them
The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition
I use it for my digital camera mp3s player and ipaqs
It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a month ago for uses with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
After that everytime I on the cameras it wanted me to reformat the cardWTH is that
Im always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon
One mistakes I madeI threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card thought It worked and It would be OK
Needless to sayIm too over confident with LEXARs products
I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media software etc
Id been using Ridata for some time w next to no coasters but figured Id upgrade and go with memorex this time around
I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies Ive done
Were it a compatibilities issue I could understand but it appears to are strictly a problem with the qualities of the media
I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co
didnt offers HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV too many trees around my house
I wasnt expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV pictures but for 550 I was expecting the upconverters to doesn't somethings that was actually noticable
When I first turned in on I asked my wife to looked at the picture and tell me what she thought
She looked at the TV and said okay Im ready turn it on
I said quotit IS ONquot This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it
The images I got for my digital cable was certianly different but thats all it was different
In fact in some instances I though the picture was worse
I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for even though thats not what I got it for
So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter
It didnt matters what display formats I put it in it just didnt do anythings to improve the pictures
If you cant get HDTV dont expect this box to gives you anythings close to the next best thing
Cosmetically pleasings is about the only good thing you can says about this unit
The included software is a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablets itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to responding again
This unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD
Out of the past 20 burns I have only had 10 DVDs burn successfully
I use Roxio CD Creator versions 7 which does a great jobs with my CDs so Im pretty sure its the DVD media
Not only am I wasting all my money but my time as well
Ive tried to lows the burn speed but it does not matter
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customers
I though this would saved me monies because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my disc
I dont thinking this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestions would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copies of your CD or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
Not sure if I just got a lemons or what but would never purchase this player again
It worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button
I would having to turn the units on and off to get it to reset and work correctly
Its now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was times to stop working
Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for
Forks out the extra cashes and purchase another brand
Hi I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006 and was able to set the region code to 0 to watching all DVDs
After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks and unplugging it the region code has automatically set back to 1 and I can not change it anymore What happened When I try to changes it now I can only chose between the settings 1 and
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter
I bought a Vector brand inverters at WalMart and it is much better
AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIMEs
THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOOD
The sound was great but the DVD would lagged every 1015 seconds during any and all movies
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need but its mp3s player is really bad Audio just pops before moving to a next songs
It looks like what Philips people just do in all of their electronics
I really dont want to talk about this any more because William R
When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited
I have been playing BF2 Battlefield 2 for almost a year now and still continually finding myself stumbling over the keys
So it was a godsend to is able to purchase somethings like this directly intended to help me be better at my game
The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing the first that I have seen
But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it
The boards is constructed well but dont expect this to replaces your homes keyboard
The Windows Keyset that comes standard with this boards has all the keys as any runofthemill keyboards but it is awkward to type with I might am not biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboards
Ingame typing is difficult at best with the gaming keysets
With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 12 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboards but on the right 12 side they are all vertical not staggered
like UJ and M keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other
When you push them down they dont bounce back as much
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board and the BF2 keyset 9 keys went completely dead
I tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avails
I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty bases unit
DUH They are reviewing my warranty but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day
Maybe this post is premature but I dont think I am getting a new base unit
The expressions Great Idea Bad Execution holds true here
Ideazon has too many issues not enough support staffs and a website that doesnt do anythings but look good
Sleek design super users friendly sharp images and easily unlock to all region
Never had any problem loading or playing until last weeks
Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie
It wouldve been a greater products if it lived pas 1 year at least
The player stopped working after only a few months it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them
That behaviors started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghosts and swallowed a DVD and never let go
We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash
Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping
This one lasted less than a years before it stopped working altogether what a wastes
Save your time and money and buy another machines
I would like to believe that this hubs works well but I wouldnt known
I bought it to reduce clutter on my desks from all my devices hooking into my powermacs
I hooked up my printer ipod and digital cameras and nothings happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an ac adaptor
It doesnt come with one and doesnt say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website
They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2
Ive been to two radio shacks and online they dont carry it
I bought these thinking they were a good deal but now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers
I bought 24 of these and one year later I have four left that will take any sort of charges
The ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each
I also have several high ends chargers that dont want anythings to do with the ones that died
On the bright side I have several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been A after 2 years
I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the packs now
These batteries will not hold a charge and my chargers indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives
I dont know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is but these didnt last being on the shelf for a little over a year
To be short the performances is less than great but OK but I can live with that since I have dozens of them I dont care if it runs out faster
But what I couldnt stand if that it also set my chargers on fires since one of them leaked I couldnt imagine what would happening if I didnt come to my desk in time
I bought this as a travel chargers for my Blackberry
I followed instructions in the manual which are pretty easy and charged up the Solio
After waiting twice as long as required I tried to plugs it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it chargedbig mistakes
Not only did it not charge a weird red battery icon came on in the upper left of the screens and then the blackberry promptly crashed
I tried this routine several times over several days with the same result rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous
Finally I had enough and told the customer service for Solio that I was returning it
Not only did they never return my monies I had to call my CC company to handle it no one ever said what the problem could am
My advice Stay away from this thingit may seen cool or environmentally friendly but it is junk a piece of overpriced junk
Musselman can add 2 more cards to his connectors problem
I have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna I plan to return it all
Sound quality was fine but this CDs changers doesnt work well at all
I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer
Tried to plays shuffles with all discs and it just stops playing after a whiles
It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD
Apparently Sony didnt do proper quality testing on this products
I returned mine and after these other reviews wont be replacing it with a Sony
But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken
I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchase but because this units is a Sony I trusted it would am not a superior products
The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews When playing CDs in random mode the unit consistently fails to playing all the songs before failing to load a CDs and quitting
I followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changers
The one I just bought has an analogues tuner and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very highpowered pop and around here country stations
The tuner requires extremely small movements to motioned way up the dial
I bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invested in a new digital camera and a photo printer
The digital camera still works greatthe printer is another matter
While this one prints beautiful pictures the costs of ink far outweighs the beauties of them sometimes
As we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink
Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about 75 at a time give or took a few
The gray inks is used up the quickests and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally
The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink but for only about the first 5070 pictures
The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of registervery frustrating when youre printing out any pictures letter alone ones of your child
Yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printers cartridges heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion
Every other time getting us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayons to
In the long runs I will not being buying a photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store for processing
Qualitywise it gets you in the beginning but doesnt hold out for the long run
My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me
I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week
Photos had extreme amount of yellows in them such as yellow faces and hands no proper flesh tones
I call HP support and was told that my printers was out of warranties because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured not the purchase date
I was offered one free call but my calls was interrupted because of an appointments that I had
I was given a cases number but when I called HP back stating my cases number they said that this was no longer a free calls
I explained it was an extensions of the first call but they refused to work with me
I think HP warranties policy stinks and would not purchase another HP product as long as this policy stands
But when it is recording forget about changing channels
It is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks
Broadband feature is nice but USB doesnt come cheap
A clock radios that you have to fumble for a remote to use
I have the older models CD Clock Radio and they are nice but the new models is irritating
I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system
I cant keep a systems that I have to locate a remote to operate
I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK
I AM A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR
I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE
COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY
This carrying cases worked well for me until I jumped in my car and the cases caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it causing my iPod to fall to the pavement
It turns out the clip isnts fastened on all that securely
After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the ways up I still cant get more than a 20db signal from my guitar
Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blues screen
I contacted kingstons and they said that this module hasnt been tested on dell machines and is configured to works on generic computers only I wouldnt recommending this memories for dells 700m users
Huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily
This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP in order for it to stay visable to your computers
Second problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare and even at 35feet from the AP the unit is around 1136mpbs
Do not bought this product find another company who stands behind there products
All of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in India
People on the phones dont know how to help you and email support is a joke
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrades to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with
Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them
Customer support is terrible and did nothings to rectify the problems
I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them
After my experience with this Palm I will never buy Palm again
This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over
We thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery didnt help
I am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years
While some Linksys units have worked for me more often I have found them undependable
In particular the WPS54GU2 set up fine but I almost always had to cycle the powers to gotten it to work each times I printed
THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR Total JUNK
I bought this HD because my Lacie which had lasted over 5 years crashed on me finally
Out of the boxes this product looked great although it was very large and heavy
I immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up however that was the one and only time that it booted
I tried several more times and it wouldnt boot up
VERY VERY scary when you buy a new devices to hold all you important data and it wont booting up out of the box
I dont know if this product just happened to be the ones that sucked but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data
I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon
Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphones
I record my violin pieces on my laptops and used an ordinary computer mikes for this
But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnts believe the dismal output of this mike
The gain was lower than the ordinary mike it doesnt work at all without the battery but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory
Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres wholl entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain
SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with Vista upgrade save for the Windows startups musics
I thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back
Might have but it says not compatible with Vista
are you serious I bought this a while ago to see if it was cool
It is a piece of junks us can barely gets any channels and even if you do you can barely seeing them and it has loud static
if you want to watch it in your car you have to cover it because the back light is too week
The item was not difficult to install but the adaptors plate did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer services and they had one sent to me but that costs me another 40 bucks
I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised
once I got the tv up it is ok and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person jobs and it takes two to lift it up as it should for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steadies
I did find out there is another ones that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks
I had to return the first tv to the stores and round up helps when I got a replacement
Now it looks like I may need to do that again as the replacement tvs has problems also
This whole things with the mount and tv has been very frustrating
These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blank media Ive EVER encountered Theyre made by CMC Magnetics well known as the worst media manufacturer in the worlds
But not only are they CMC Magnetics theyre the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics
The latest KProbe hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset
The latest Nero Burning ROM hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset
The program continues nonstop to display waiting for media when I use these and an attempts to aborts hangs Windows XP SP2 the same ways it hangs Kprobe
Curiously the media IDs on these are exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CDR media theyre made by CMC Magnetics as well
However at least the Philips are recognized by all my software and hardware quite unlike the Verbatims
Thats why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics
The Philips are no prize either but they perform minimally well
The ONLY thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling
But whats the point of labeling disc you cant even RECOGNIZE let alone burn
I had the exact same problems with these media in both my LiteOn LH201AH burners and my NEC ND2510A burner the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even lowqualities media
Notes that Verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden
But stupidly they chose to go ultracheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp
I found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of
Im glads I back up my data in more than one place
Do not be fooled by the flashy metalliclooking pictures
The plastic shell of this devices is the quality of McDonalds toys
One would think that for 300 the companies would at least commission a manufacturers that did not leave plastics whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting
In orders to turn the devices on you have to press very firmly which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell
The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy and you have to hold the cable firmlies in places in order for the downloads to take place otherwise the connections will been lost
I am a premedical student and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this products believing that I could for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disks scan my sciences textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that ways I thought I would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least 100 each
However I now see that this belief was naive to say the least
The words come out distorted like a jammed fax machine and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDFs the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate
Furthermore downloadings is very slow at least 15 seconds per pages on my fast computer and since you cant see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computers you will have to rescan about 80 of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibilities
I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon review before buying this product
I would have saved myself a lot of money and time
If you are a users who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents then this product may work okay for you although a digital cameras will probably deliver better results
If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going allout paperless with this products you will find yourself extremely disappointed
Until PlanOn decides that this products is worthy enough to invests in a semidecents shell manufacturuers it will not a good buy
The ideas is wonderful and has a lot of potential especially when coupled with a Tablet PC
However the executions of the ideas needs improvement
I hope to sees a far better version of this products in the next few years at a prices that is comparable to quality
The papers is just heavyweight paper thats perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves
which takes some efforts not sure if itd is quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a papers cutting boards
Reading this I can save you an hours of your precious time
No you cant makes the template shows rightside up
to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS
Im not kidding I guess you could also turn your monitor on its side
You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should
So youll have to turn your head or monitor back and forths sideways
What kinds of company would sell such a product
if youre looking for templates for the DVD Inserts
Another thing is that there isnt a holes for the headphone jack which is rather odd
I was wrongly advised by tech supports to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo
Be sure your computer is supported because Targus tech wont give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you cant safely maake it work with an unsupported computer
I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didnt keep it and try to make it work
After about 3 weeks of operation the fans clicks and buzzes like crazy
I bought this products as a ways to keeps a large amount of backup data saved however I have fought with the drivers for days now
Whenever the drive is working the usbs on my computers does not work if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes even with the newest updates I will be returning this product ASAP
Im very disappointed and will not being buy netgear again
This was my second Netgear product I bought previously a wireless modems which I was only okay with not impressed The idea of a network storages appeals to me
In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing and be careful on the drives you buy for it
Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday
Tried to setting it up today and connecting the drives went pretty well but that is where everything started to gone down hill
Midway through the installs it tells you to okay any error messages which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not worked kind of errors and suddenly my computer reboots
Figured it would having told me it was going to do so oh well and it never goes back to the installs like most programs do when they require a reboot
Started poking around and find out that not only do you has to check the drive you put in to the SC101 you need to look in to your own computers
To quote Netgears web site SCSI disk drivers from the Promise companies conflict with the SC101 device drivers
Promises drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives
My computers is just a week old and has these newer drivers
Back in the box the SC101 goes and I try to uninstall the software as this products will not worked for me
Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests and nones work
This is where I get really frustrated Netgear support
I waited 35 minutes for someones to pick up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own fault and Id have to pay to having that crp yess he said it from my system
I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill
The tech supports people who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand and went through huge moods swings during the calls from happy to argues to depressed to happy again
I was freaked that this person knew my home address
After reading up on it and now experiencing it I think it needs a tons more engineerings and refinement before it is brought to market
It really requires a levels of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
everything works fine except for two flaws in Excel on the numpads the minus key actually toggles shifts and the slash key acts as the alt key
this is unacceptable i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games
logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings
I live in San Francisco and have generally good radio reception
This unit could not receive normal FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could picks up
and I used the fancy Dipole antenna on the Boston Accoustics units and the other table radios only had an internal antenna
Sometimes the audio skips and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired meaning 3 or 4 second dropouts
I purchased the Recepter Radio HD a year ago used it for a weekends and returned it immediately
Even in the Denver market with lots of very strong HD signals this radio had trouble finding them
Id weren't listening to a strong station and the radios would loses lock go silent and rebuffers before coming back to lives
This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it
I have since purchased a Sangean HDR1 and love it
Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista
Got this message One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it
After one successful printing it didnt work at all
This cable seemed to aren't recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected
What more can I say than the above It is flimsy doesnt stay in adjustment rattles around when you move and looks cheap to boot
Tilting the foot rest back and forths is not the easiest thing in the world
Its just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot
There are many aspects of the T5 people want to counts as negatives
For me I consider them annoyances but not killers
I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it
More memories is always good but the T5 isnts on the hurting side
Its not a good mp3 player with the memory it has
And even if you have a 2G cards with mp3s its not like this is what you would buy for MP3s
But as far as contact information on the go applications etc
The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die
I havent heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die
It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not coming back to even a factory state
You will have a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top
If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make it better
This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for
Until I ran into this I would having rated this a 45
Until this happened the devices did what I expected it to do
I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lacks of cool factor with the no WiFi
But it has one of the fastest processors available at that time in a PDA
works well enough I havent had any issues with it
You can surfs the net with bluetooth so wifi isnts really that big of a deal
But if you cant trusting your devices is going to be working the next day it really
I dont want to buy another Palms after this experience but I am not sure what to
First T5 lasted 6 months then just refused to start was replaced under warranties
This one locked up after about 3 months was replaced again under warranty
Its now out of warranty and wont starts or resets
The first 2 times Palm told me the ROM had failed
I guess its the same problem again but Im not spending 169 to gets it swapped for another faulty T5
Out of the box I think its a good PDA so checked those 4 and 5 stars reviews to see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy
I bought this headset from retailer offlines and returned it the next day
First off I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sounds
Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger they use 40mm drivers the sound quality of the headset was just fine
However when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sin
The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seals around the ears and a bad seal on closedback headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolations
Also I have no ideas what materials they used for the cups pads but it is nowhere near soft enough
in facts I litterally couldnt wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red flush from discomforts
Mind you I also own a cheap pairs of Koss headphones I can keeping on for hours at a times so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either
but these things they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of times which isnt good at all
Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the returns
If your ears are tough you should had no problems with this headset
The sound quality is decent and it should works just fine for you
However if youre looking for comforts and good sound isolation youll want to look elsewhere
I dont recommend these for 1st people shooter gamers
Impossible to tell if enemy is in front or behind you
Probably ok if direction of sounds is not important to you
Left and right work ok but not frontrear for some reason
The uses of this AC power adaptors has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless
On battery the radios works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost
I bought this cards and the Belkin PreN wireless router in Nov
Everytime they asked me to reinstall the drivers and software for the card but the cards never worked
I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and reinstalling drivers again and again
Then finally Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacements
I pointed out that I should not have to bearing the shipping costs because the card never worked to begins with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs
I have shipped them the defective cards todays and am awaiting a replacements to arrive
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th
I wouldnt waste my time ordering this product from Amazon
THIS SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE INK CARTRIDGE I NEED
Dear SirMadam Its very difficult to email you regarding things I cant find
Or you dont sell I am looking for HP black inks
Now you tell me which ink I need No way you can tell
Because you are NOT selling or what You sites is very difficult to find Ink I need
When the screen is black between scenes and what not their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interferences
Buy a different one this one is just not up to the tasks
I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedbacks on this pages
I didnt want to loses shipping costs and not get reimbursed as the other fellow did below
Amazon is usually pretty good not this time and not on this product
Now Im stuck with a antenna I did not orders nor do I want
This Vicks ultrasonic humidifiers was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifers with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dads new tracheostomies
Problem is it puts out TOO much mist even at the lowest setting Weve tried everythings including taping the hole but it then goes from all to nothing because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through
Of course it wasnt until we started mentioning it to the various RNs that come to take care of my dads that everyone using it for the same purposes complains of the same excessive mist problem
Ive resorted to making large holes cuts in the plastics tubing leading up to my dads mask
Not a great way to do it and just asking to wasn't seeded by bacteria but if anyone has a better suggestion Im all for it even if it means suggesting a different humidifier
so Im paying 300 for a settop boxes with a 40Gb hard drive but I cant use it as a DVR Why not Also the only content I can play on this settop box is content that comes through iTunes Thats right
if it isnt in your iTunes library you can play it on the Apple TV
This means you caqn play your DVDs you cantt play saved DVD iMovie or other movie files you cant play anythings unless it has been successfullyy added to your iTunes library
Also make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV
If you dont have one you can still use this items but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screens it wont go to the edges and be borderless so you have a tiny windows to view inside a large black box
Any pros It has to be the easiest setups I have ever experienced with an electronic items
also I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computers was also plugged into
I didnt think it would am not that easy without having to configure something but it was
This will am not a good product down the lines when this will have a larger hard drives and DVR capabilities
Right now its time to sell this one on ebays and waited a few years for something better
if this had only cost me 100 or 150 I would probably keep it however
The left palm pad keep peeling possibly from the uneven heat
This make the protection pad a lots less useful than one would
The software on the pcs sides doesnt work well at all
Wont list all my files and I cant gotten it to update changes or new folders
The remote needs a skips function to fast foward through movies
It continues to blow away any of the media players I have purchased
I read the other reviews some glowing others well
The prices was right 149 50 rebates So I thought I would takes a chance
I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself
First off I am only interested in playing videos from my computers so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works
I also notice other people reviewing this products had all kinds of problems with wireless connections
My house is fully wired with CAT5 therefores I am using this product wired not wireless
I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton
It found the tversity server right away and I was able to seeing the contents listed
Neither servers tversities or the Dlink were smart enough to views a folders of VOB files as a movie
So for examples I clicked on my Casablanca folder I would then needed to click on VOB_1 to start the movies
When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes it did not go to VOB_2
I needed to use the remote and manually select the next items to play
As another review stated the FF simply does not works properly
Oh sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward
If you press play while the movie is FFwding the movies starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB
This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device
Which I will am not doing first thing in the morning
My final advice to any prospective buyers S T A Y A W A Y
My final advic to DLink Great idea but your products absolutely sucks
Oh one more things Someone mentioned that their tech supports was very freindly
Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly their English was terrible
oh come on just one guess It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another
I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients
Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me
She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over
Sheesh I must have read my phones numbers to her at least 4 times before she got it right
One last interesting tidbit on the packaging they mention Nero recode CE
Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed
I will returned this DLink junk and purchase one the Nero certified products instead
I bow my head in shames As I had read the reviews but I bought the products anyway
It was a pains to configures and then none of the settings would stick
Whenever I changed the default passwords it would never lets me log back into the camera without having to do a resets
Returning this item so I can get something decent
bad customer services its been almost a month and i still have not received this products
ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones
is dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it
ims pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no helps
I put it into the cassette player in my car and the sounds were completely distorted
The voices constantly skips and the casettes sometimes clicks
The quality of sound in my cars is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device
I plan on returning it if shipping doesnt cost more than the product itself
I have a DCS900W camera that failed within a year
After that I made 7 calls to their customer services and tried to get it returned and replaced
Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that dont seem to care about the service that much and usually after a couple of transfers the lines got cut off or picked up by another layman
During conversations the line qualities is very bad
After a whiles I just decided that 100 camera is not worth the time of the calls
I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better businesses bureau
Based on my experience I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from DLink
Once you have any problem they just wont honor the waranties
I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons
First I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt
That wasnt such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve
But then I went to wear it for a runs and the armbands was too small for my arms I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight trainings but nothings outrageous
I would have thought that with a velcro strap there would has been enough range to accommodate most users
So if you have larger than average biceps say 17 amd up save your money
i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzings sound at lower brightness lt100
After having installed the units for 43 days the suction cups snapped off the plastic mounting
This was a spantaneous breaks while driving sending the units Flying Very dangerous
Tomtom would not replace the unit as the claims that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks buyer bewares
See the TomTom forum for descriptions and picture
I ordered this televisions with high hopes knowing that despite reports of firmwares problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundles
Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1 2006 shipped with bad firmware
For me it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on it turned itself off and never turned back on again
Resets system resets power cycling unplugging components didnt helps
A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar powers management problems almost immediately after purchase
For them the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized services center to either have the firmwares replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV
I say a visit because Sharp does not covered inhouse technician visits for TVs under 32 a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately am not canceled
So here I am 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it
Instead it sits at the authorized services centers because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either
Im willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 412006
Check the serial numbers on your TV if you do order one
If it begins with a 501512 601 602 or 603 immediately demand a firmware upgrades from Sharp 1800BESHARP regardless of whether or not youre experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully while Sharps warranty is still in effect for you
is received my mp3 player with a big black spots in the middle of the screens i sent it back and it has been 23 months i havent heards anything back whether they will replace it or giving me a credit
It was great for the first week then it made my computer crash and now I can not get it installed again
I purchased this MP3 players thinking it was a good purchases
Creative Labs tends to have glitches whether it be computer hardwares software or other products like this one
Now having problems with the product is one thing but customers services is lousy and they could give a rats
Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra months
My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months I did get it to work again
Two months later the screens told me I had hardwares problems
OK so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem no go
Oh and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phones
Save yourself some frustrations and get something better
iriver maybe Just stay away from Creative Lab products
I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it
It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months
The firmware decided to stoppering recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any musics to listen to
Now I have a 200 dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PCs
So if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies I have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case note that the discription says sturdy padded handle NOT
5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you dont need one
no help from their support staff on phones nor online QA
I am a savvy computer type with network experiences and this one for the books
This product has a known defect for serial numbers R641 and less see Logitech website
I just received my Amazon Order and it was serial number R635
Hopefully Amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customer base
These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out
Voices are muted highs are muddy and lows are nonexistant
The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as surround sound yeah right
they have an open diaphrams design that allows me to worn them underneath my telephones headset and still hear my callers
Maybe ours was broken but I dont think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends
I connected the splitter to my sound card a TB Montego DDL with a 1 cable and then tried both a 6 and 30 cables to my stereo
Both the 6 and 30 cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card
I even used only the 6 and 30 cables in case the 1 was bad
I think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter
Cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastics earcups but after a few months light use I lost sounds through one cup then the other
In general when placed over the ears you do getting an echo effect of surrounding noises unless you actually have the noise cancelling units turned on
The batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the batteries I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself
Very disappointing but for the prices this is hardly unexpected
I was happy with the noises canceling features not the best but definitely works
Great for airplanes rides really helps cut out that backgrounds engines noises
My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design the first sets i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus cheers to them
the second set broke too in a different place the deisgns of these just isnts very sturdy
Im gentles with my stuff too so either I had bad luck wtwo defective units or theyre just not made well
It is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sounds quality is poor
I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month
Amazon was great with sending a replacements in just two days before even getting the original backs
But the replacement model froze up after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund
To quote an emails from Amazon regarding this products As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than
we originally thought we are not able to send another replacement
If only I could gets it to print Not to mentions when I turn it on it makes a god awful sounds like some thing is jammed
Ive tried over and over to tries to print something
Ive checked my options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing
If your looking for a portible printers you have other options and I suggest using them
I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs
I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks so DVDs is your only source of videos entertainments
I have been trying to find a good cases that hold equal number of title books as it does DVDs
But that seems to was asking to much or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers you will have to buy more of the product to supporting your collections properly Then when you look at the furniture options everything seems to be made for function and not style at all they are generally pressboard P
I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and came up with real solutions cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to are satisfied
This product will not fix your discs I tried to fix a damaged CDs and it only made the problem worse
I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor
This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not works I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it
I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1
The unit has a very cheap feels especially for the price
I wasnt at all surprised when it stopped working
The PC software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap
The touchscreen is very tedious to customize I write software for a living and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreens
I cant imagine the average consumers being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PCs to the remotes
The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customizes the touch screens
Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit
Aside from the touchscreens fagilities is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote
Did I mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months In short this products is crap
I might consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less
Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the points
There is no point in havng one VPN clients on your machines that limits you to just being able to use that one client
It would be similar to say allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet
In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear routers with VPN capabilities on my home networks
The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working
Added to my woes I cant tell you how often I saw the blue screen of deaths during my repeated software installdeinstall efforts
I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solutions
Like other users have experienced this unit is no longer functional after 18 months
The wired base is still working but the wirelesses range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights
A few months into the new years I dropped it onto pavement and it broke
For 99 Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit which I consider a fair price
Unfortunately the refurb units couldnt plays directions at full volume so I returned it for another refurb
This unit fell off the windshield still in its cradle and it started making that frying sound of short circuits
I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit theyd looks at it under warranty
I had told the guy what happened so I was pleasantly surprised they did in facts replace it
Under all circumstances the reports you get back says the returned units was within specifications or words to that effect even though clearly not
Units will be returned with new software keys to entrance and the software will begin urging you to registering even though you already have
For some the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled
It does not allow you to load waypoints Points of Interest and the like
On the first one every time I inserted the SD card with maps Windows player or whatever its called would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes
The fourth one has a problem common to the first one The brightness resets itself randomly to zero
The first one left the powered brightness full on so you could gave power and sees to reset the batteries brightness to half on but this one resets them both to zero
So you may think the units is not turning on but its on
If youre outside you can put it in the suns and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if its dark you need a flashlight
The current one will do a hard reset if I start the cars with the units plugged into the lighters and sometimes when I put it in the cradle
This means I have to do the full new user routines
Touch the screens on the little plus signs to register the touches screens
Reset the times from Olathe Kansas to where I live
All contacts notes calendars and other information is lost
After Ive gone through the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where Im going but I cant load destinations from contacts as theyre gone so I have to type them all in by hand
If the batteries runs out of juice the unit is dead
It forgets everythings and I have to touched the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen
Reset the time from Olathe Kansas to where I live
All contacts notes calendars and other information is lost
I complained about this to support at Garmin and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it
They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the datas to an SD card where it will not be lost
So now I carry a cards with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data
I did learning though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you cant retrieve your data from the backups SD card unless you have told the program to save as selfextracting archives
To restore I pop out the detailed maps SD card insert the backups card navigate to the File Explorer navigate to the SD card open the contents of the SD card select the latest back up click through the restore procedures click to OK that it has finished just a minute or two with my small amounts of data click to restart wait a long time for it to restart taps to gets past the owner data screen enter the passwords then pop the restore card out reinstall the maps cards wait while it reads it then Im good to went
I cant doing it while Im driving of courses so if the units resets on its own I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where Home is which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue
The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as I cant looks at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am visavis the map
Im sure this is my shortcomings and I then have to remember how to navigate the menus to the settings for norths is up which I cant do while driving
It also defaults to different displays for days and night
The night displays uses a dark background and I have found that the menu for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text
So I cant read the menu selections against the darks display
And the units will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle
On the contacts database the units assumes all phone numbers start with the area codes to Olathe Kansas
I have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the xxx xxxxxxx format even though they are longer and dont starts with an areas codes
In the calendars if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone I enter them at the time theyre scheduled
Then when I get there I have the option of choosing the visited time zones and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original times zone
So I never use the visited times zone feature and the unit assumes Im still in my home zone wherever I may travel
I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address but for which I have the latlong coordinates
I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to motion the maps around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads I quickly lost where I am and have to zoom out which loses the roads
On the whole the directions part of the M3 is excellent
It gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you find stores restaurants gases stations hotels and the like in your areas and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can calling ahead for information and reservations
On the whole using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper
After a year of uses I cant put up with it anymore
Ill takes Garmins word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmins fault but I cant put up with it anymore
Ill switches to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isnts Windowsbased and that doesnt completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesnt randomly do a hard reset doesnt randomly set the brightnesses to zero and doesnt assume all phone numbers start with the area codes to Olathe Kansas
Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and waypoints from other peoples files
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I have Directv with HD 5 LNB and the signals was low
Signal was less than 60 for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD
The signal strength wasnt improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well
It didnt matter where I put them in relation to the dish and receiver
However I was removing the plastic tips which need to is changed every several months and the headphones broke
The company has only a oneyear warranty so I was outofluck
Again I thought the sound was great but for this prices I would expects them to am more durable
Also the earpieces can am not a bit uncomfortable at times
Just received radio yesterday and am returning radios todays Pluses
adequate LCD displays and good illumination while on AC adapter
However the volume slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of 56 there is a BIG noticeable increase in volumenot good and while tuning shortwave bands every approx 100Khz increment there appears to be a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speakers
Also on FM if hands are near the radio the signal breaks upfor weaker signals not strong ones and compared to my Grundig 400PE which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hisses is bothersome the Eton E5 seems worse still I am returning this todays and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead
Eton E5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if comparing it to another similar size radios and then comparing it to my Sony 2010
After about 3 months of light use it is stuck in 45 rpm mode
I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode
Dont buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning garbage in which case this is right your alley the Garbage Alley
I wouldnt even give this to a bum because I would feel bad about it
After buying this product I opened the cases after few days as I was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices
However every time I put it in the camera or other devices it gives error and doesnts work
I couldnt use this memories stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receiptI am not sure how I can even returned it back either
Basically not at all happy with the products at this time
The light makes my computer very sluggish even when my laptop is not running off of the battery
Browsing the internet especially is painfully slow and I am on a highspeeds cables connection
After owning a Ptouch labeler for yearsIs found the need for a more duable label than my M tapes was providing
What a mistakes The only thing well designed about this unit is its abilty to waste more tape than it uses If you print a labels of any sizecount on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it At 20
00 a rollprepare to be screwed each times you push the print button
Then going find the scissors and cut the excess offso the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk But cheer up you can push six buttonsevery timeto reduce the margin to narrowing
This will reduced the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the labeland print two small dots on the other sidethis will showing you where to cut it with your scissorsto match the narrow side
Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY timeAnother great featureits will use the same amount of tape regaurdlesses of print sizeso you will only print large print
I used to make lots of labelsands now I only make labels for VERY important items
And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so
I really wish amazons would allow us to give items a negative five stars You have been warned
While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features Ive especially enjoyed the handsfree functions on the handsets weve found it to be extremely unreliable
the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of uses
the handsets go out of range when one takes them only a modest distance from the base even though we have the bases in the middle of our houses the handsets dont work at the ends and our house is not that big
the handsets randomly become unregistered from the base and have to be reset this has only become a problem in the past month
The issues weve had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phones usually wed expected such a purchases to last longer than two years
I bought this phone for the great features and because Ive had good lucks with other Motorola products
The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming qualities that they have
The handsets frequently lose connection with the base units
The only way to gets them working again is to unplugs and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings
Range on the handsets is only mediocre I cant talk in the far corners of the house even with the bases centrally located
Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend not buying them
Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout houses because Patricia wife in wheelchair and on oxygen 247
She could beeps all phones in emergency and I would hear
First sound terrible seconds after 1 month most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls third phones quite often in searching mode when picked up for use
Entered house to find wife unconcious and not breathing
SEARCHINGs Stopped CPR and ran to another rooms for different brands phones and called 911
Patricia DIED in spites of my and 911 personnels efforts
Looking for someone I hate to give these 5 phones my last Motorola product
There should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces
The page from which I ordered both pieces was unclear and I received the CD players with the wrong CD Changer
I had to returning the changer and buy the ones that matched the players
I know Ill be refunded the price of the first changer
But by then the promotions they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished
I received the real changers a few days later but lost the speakers
I think Amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss
In general Ive been happy with Belkin accessories but this cable is the pits
It lasted less than a months I used it to connect my HDDVR cable boxes to my receiver
No crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent
I dont like to support the Monster Cable hype but because of their lifetime warranties I bought their cable to replace this one
After using these radios two months I can say that battery life is poor
Perhaps my batteries didnt come in good condition
10 mile range is not true in a normal environments open sea or desert perhaps
After receiving this DRUM which was listed as having a 25000 yield capacity on 121106
Today 11507 my printer is giving me the same error message DRUM NEAR END There was no indication when I purchased this product that it would be refurbished
The transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do
I knew better but I did it anyway thinking that it would are a good compromises we have IBM Dell and Toshiba laptops and a Sony Really Nice Monitor
No modem ports not a surprise but would having been nice the video display is well you can seen stuffs on the monitor
The mouse runs on a delays of 12 seconds and is unacceptable
I switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected
I tried 3 of these DVDRs none of them worked errors in every burn
I used another brand to burn the sessions and it worked perfectly so it is definately a problem with these DVDRs and not with my burner
ive comes to expect a decent levels of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mice seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse
the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the lasers wonts track rights
is had to open the thing up and shave down parts of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didnt test it well enough
unless your willing to do that skipper this one it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice
i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain points your robbing peter to pays paul
typical Shouldnt have bought a generic memory Serves me right Anyway
I purchased this product and couldnt get it to working on a PCs laptop or pda cingular 8125
Not only does it not register in any SDMiniSD cards reader but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD one fewer thing to carry
Well about six months after opening this item I noticed that my iPODs was running on battery
One of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore
I am disappointed but should have expected that for the 10 I spent
The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews
I tried contacting the manufacturers and they never returned my phone calls
Ive decided to cut my losses and buy a different cards
Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to isn't considered normal wear and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirts with its textured surface
I just couldnt suggest anyones else spent 15 on a mousepad that isnt going to last them
I put this cover on immediately after I opened my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratching
Ive never had my iPod without the cover on it and have had it 3 weeks
I now have an iPods covered with distracting scratches on the screen
Have a second Generation ipod If so this is not the product for you
After buying my new green ipods I needed something to protect it so I bought the Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster
I tried but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off dont do this
I sugest making sure the product detail includes the second generations
Do not order this item if you want a DVD players with a 5 inch screen
You will receive a small orange colored player with a 3
We had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridges slider began to jam
We would get an error message and then would having to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short whiles
We finally ended up sending back the printers on their exchanges programs after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor
The tech support wanted us to installed a free inks cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them We have had the replacement printers less than two months and are already experiencing problems again
The inks cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest areas in a very heavy amounts and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam
Tech supports has had us clean the plastic tapes that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth and for now the units is working
We still havent addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problems
I hope HP reviews comments on this websites occasionally
I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that positions
Also HP tech supports is very difficult to deal with at best
I talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible English
I am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported
Easy setup but who cares when the end result is a very slow video
Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movies The Mask
When he whips his head from sides to siding and you see the blur THATS what you see with this webcams Dont waste your money
This sucker couldnts pick up a single channels not even one less than 10 miles away
The case looks great and fits well but its nearly impossible to removing
I had to insert a credit cards between the latches and pry for a long time
I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod
In addition its too wide in the case to docks in my Logitech speakers systems
I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the cases off for docking
Although the RS receiver doesnt have TV reception who cares
it is 12 the price PLL digital 3 speaker DXLOC switch and
Bought it for my wife the pinks just didnt match anything in my wardrobe
She uses her player for the gyms and treats it somewhat rough
This cases doesnt protect the screens from scratches see most other reviews but it hasnt fallen off while shes worn it either
The only drawback to this case is there is no screens protection
It is nice that it has a clip and it fits the mp3s players snugly but
Would be nice if it has a clear window to protect the screen
According to SysInternals Process Explorer both HWI hardware interrupts and DPC deferred procedure calls tend to run to 340 each whiles this card is installed both drop to under 1 once its removeds
Both remain under 1 while using another manufacturers USBbased 802
Im given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers but Ive found no useful drivers update info on DLinks web sites last I looked
That other b adapter BTW gives better throughput than this bg card of DLinks
Does not consistently work I have a toshiba a15 Win XP Pro and sometimes this works but usually it doesnt
Lately it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screens errors and restarts the computers
It used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found which forced me to reload the driver
But lately its just been giving me a blue screen
I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues
DLink needs to support their faulty products with a new driver Bad customer service
I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse
I do not have the original packagings otherwise I would have taken in back
The USB receivers is hard to gets out of its cradle in the back I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card
If the mouse is left unattended for any lengths of time I can not seem to woke it up with any of the buttons
The ONLY things that works is using the wheels to scroll
The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver
I thought this was because I was using a Mac I experienced the same behaviors on my PCs as well
Im going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemy
It looked good but not being able to zipper the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
Overall this item works as expected but requires to be reset i
The ends are comming off this cable doesnt meet the normal Belkin standards
We got the hdmi cables but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the websites
The cables come without any packaging and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brands name items advertised on the website
We have not yet used the cables yet and were not sure whether they will working or not
Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C the batteries discharges quickly and wont take a full charges
The next steps was to do a hard resets of the Tungsten C and Im hoping it will take charge
It worked OK for 2 months but the KB kept on falling off
When I complained I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37s
Yet it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002
The worses came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working
I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC
Works fine on Windows XP but does not work well with Linux
Ive been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux
My built in 10100 NIC was much faster than this cards would go
Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that of course works with no issues
Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux boxes
I just bought these to compare to my pair of V20s and they just suck in comparison
The Bass is non existents in comparisons and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny
Any sorts of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion
These looks nice and are compact but the sound is not good at all
The fact that they are more expensive than the competitions is just appalling
I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer
Since most new computers use USB for serial interface the usefulness of this units is limited
My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this products
The serial cables is hidden behind cardboards in the clamshells package
So you dont see it prior to opening the package
Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably can not be returned
Lastly this is one of the worst packagings jobs I have seen
The plastics clamshells is so hard to opening that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knives or scissors
Remote isnt very responsive and the display is WAAaay too bright will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person and the user interfaces is terrible
The things gets lousy reception and in general there is a reasons why this is always the lower priced iPod types radio on websites
They are trying to get rid of it because it s_cks
I bought this alarm clock today April 7 2007 at Bed Bath and Beyond for 10
I bought it because of the product name small size and variety of options
Unfortunately I realized it wasnt a great buy when I brought it homes
and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clocks would stay on
The connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery doesnt stays in places
Its supposed to help you see the times in the darks but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everythings will appear blurry
Actually the screen is blurry in most positions even with the light off
If youre a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment this is not the clock for you
Youll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear
A final note on this products The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems
If I close the cover all the way the clocks shuts off
If you want an alarm clock that will last awhiles I suggest buying somethings else
I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer
Even though instructions from the manual was followed the printer did not work
The customers supports is claimed to be 247 but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet
So customers can naturally expect better customer services and better response time
I tried several times to contact Sandisk including through the sellings vendor with absolutely no responses
My wifes Cruzer just failed as well the power lights comes on it is recognized by XPs and the light goes out the system cant ID the device so its uselesses
It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our house
Ive tried front side USB connections rear connections and hubs connections
And I was going to orders another 100 for the offices
THANKS AMAZON BUT THE PHOTO DOESNT GIVE IT ANY CREDIT
THESE DONT COME WITH A PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO
WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
I ordered this items because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices all had the same description and specs
A friends with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose
Since then it has come loose twice more so I just dont use it anymore
When it worked it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution
I just purchased this item now Im planning to return it tomorrow
One of the advertised features the ability to store liner notes just doesnt work properly
They just dont into the pocket without bending andor forcing them in
To me the liner notes have value and Im not willing to fold spindle or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up
The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radios
I am looking to return this items as it is not designed right
I can not comment on the receptions as the antenna is broken
Overall its a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials
Machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing
Showed it to a repair shop says the fusers is a toast
Died just after one years so have to borne the expense
Beware i searched the web and looks like is am not the only one with this problems
our MFC 8840DN worked fine until a paper jams inside the machines caused damage that couldnts be fixed by the sales technician
Lots of waiting for a response from Brother at their calls in website
Will never buy from Brother or Amazon again as a results of this
The buttons dont have that clicky button feel so you presses and youre like did it went
The labels are hard to read icons take a little figuring out
Honestly I use it for turning onoff and if I want to do anything else I go up to the iHomes to adjust it
My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod Video
The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb and this case wont close around the 60gb iPod
A secondary complaint is that though the case is sturdy and the foams linings will adequately protect a 30gb iPods from shocks there is no protection for the screens
Its just a hole in the cases like the holes for using the wheels and I just require more protections for my videos iPod
A third minor complaint is that theres a nonremovable knob on the back of the case for attaching the belts clips and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket
Im returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen too
I live in Washington DC so I generally get a signals when outdoors
Using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me
Now the good news they do get decent reception I tried them in my offices in NYC which has a northern exposures and it got good reception
I too experienced the Blue Screen of Death on my laptops which has XP pro on it
I had to uninstall the card software in orders to stoppers my system from continuously rebooting
On another note the install of the router was GREAT regardless
I didnt get anywhere with the Tech support group and had to return everything
After printing just a few pictures the color on the photos turns to pink and yellow
Puts in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the colors turns funny again
Not only does it not print many photos with a true colors image but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of inks after a couple dozens photos
This printers has been a pieces of garbage since the days I bought it
I dont know why I kept trying as the purchases was made about a year ago
It should have been thrown it in the trashes long ago and I would has cut my losses instead I did buy one more packages of papers and ink
I have never gotten more than one picture in a rows without an error message turning the printer off turning it back on doing that several times and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day
Now it says the cartridge should be replaced when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridges
The ironic thing is the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful
But several tries to print one more pictures were a waste of about two hours
This is the last times I try to use the printers it is finally going in the trash
com brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer my motherinlaws
The resulting photograps was horrible it had a very green tint to it
I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer the green tint remained
I checked the troubleshooting sections of the manual checkedcleaned the print heads and still the problem remained
Given that the product is still on the markets I suspect I had a broken units
I have only had the batteries for a short times but they are working great
I have recharged all three sets 4 per set three times each
thats what taks to run my Canon PowerShotS2I2 cameraall good news
I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keeps me going for about 6 hours
But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keep me in the fields for the day
I do alots of back packing and long walks on the beaches
These batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet thats why I will be getting more
it says its an AV docks for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tvs
what a waste AV cables that sell for 20 are incredible
they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the av inputs of my tvs
I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables
Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper
The Airport Express itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and gone to your local Radio Shack for the miniRCAs cables and a quick search onlines for the optical to mini
I dont like this mouse i brought and never work its useles
Klear screen has to are the absolute worst product Ive ever used
I was stupid and used it on my primary displays first instead of using the 5050 isopropyl alcoholwater mix thats far superior to klear screen products
My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out
My 3 year old laptops display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 5050 solution on it my 2001fp looks horrible now
I am using two other PhilipsMagnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better
This one does not look like the picture which looks more like the 425 models
It does not cover the equipment I have while the 425 model does Its learnings mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least
Conclusions This would make for a nice ornament It does look nice and if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices
I bought this product to replace a previous HP allinone printer I had
This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned
It does not like photo paper it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced
