When I tried to switch gel covers it comes with 3 differentv sizes the entire earpiece came off in my hands
The ear gels are comfortable att first but aftera an hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it
thek sound quality isl TERRIBLE People I am talking to sound very muddledt and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300
What is worse people I am talking to hear me veryz poorly
They say there isf so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar even when Im justj sitting in my car
People can barely hear me over the backgroundt noise racket
Beware The Product Features for this product specified
I selected this modelk because of thes advertised feature
I returned the item and was charged for the return shipping
I emailed themm notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertisingc a feature that was not part of the productw
In the online return process theres no option that states the return was a result of Amazon
Basically they falsely advertise so that you buy the product and when you discover its not theo right oneu youre screwed
I now understand all those complaints iveo read about Amazon
Ill take the loss this time but ik wontp repeat my mistake and order from them again
This reviewh is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon
I couldnt use the productu so sorry ig couldnt give a review about it
I purchased this iteme for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005v for 29
I was told itd would work for the lgz phones which is what I haved
I see now youo can no longer find thesey for sale and geeh I wonder why
I probable usedi thisg item ap total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car I didnt really use it while driving my truck whichu wasm automaticp
and after only 8 uses a friend of mine also bought one andp his lasted about 6 months as welly
While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear youc atn the other end and you have tor constantly pull the plugl and stick it back in after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work
com but have not tried to call themu yet and had no results with thez emails
I have a feeling I lose anywayse withw this purchase
The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for lgz cell phones Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but alh least it was free and still works topo notch
To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but verye short lived
Mine lasted forb only three weeks then one day stopped working
I went through 2 of these inv as many months the sound quality was veryi spotty and thec mic would intermittently quito working
People regularly had a hard time understanding me when thef mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldnt even distinguishi between yes and no
Design is great and very comfortable but soundx quality is poore people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled
However after a month or twoh of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece
I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which putr strain on the plastic
The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress
I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear its unobtrusive and lightw
howeverl I constantly get complaints from whoever Im talking to on the phone that my voice is too quietz
I have to speak upw louderu than normal and cups my hand around the back of the microphonek in order tov produce an acceptable volume which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset
The problem seems to be that thev boom is tooc short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side ofr the mouth
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable at least fore me
Its a bit hard to make thee earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this
Also the insert comes off very easily andz if as friendh wants to borrow it and has differentb size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert
Sound qualityr is mediocrem ast callees oftenz complain about wind noise from my end
Apparently youv need to quotknowquot your technical specs Universal does not mean Nokia so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesnt work with Nokia I getf the expense of sending itf back
This should be one the technical specs which are crap on this site
I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustratedq because the bluetooth doesnt work well sometimes itq has connection bluetooth but most of the time it doesnt work
Yeah itsh a good looking cellphone but notz a friendly user onep
I purchased a brand new Samsung t809 and right out of the boxn the batteryj cover would not stay on the phone
I went to a genuine TMobile retailer and after working on the phone for ak good halfanhour they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit
theh sales rep had a t809 himself and was easilyi able to get his personal battery cover to fit
aftery six weeks of hassling them over the issue the end result was that the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty
What End result iz get to duct tape my battery in place
If youre going to spend seriousv money on a high end phone
go with a brand name thatk actually stands behindi their product
I gotb this phone basically for free but even taking that into account Im pretty disappointed withd the phone
This is my firsty Samsung and Im pretty sure my last one I owned a Nokia before andu I regret that I betrayed itd
From now ih wouldnt get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe SonyEricsson
So here is a short list of those little things that make yourp life withm thisa phone and itsn combination with tmobilel annoying
its not really comfortable to openclose theo slider and to make itn easier you haves to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time
putting as comma while writing a text message capitalizes the next word what is the logic int that it annoys me because i doe use text messages a lot
you can only save 1 phonel type for each category what if the person has 2 business phones
you can not choose theb email address of a personc from the contact list wheny you want to send a picture message to an email addressx
And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through like it wouldve been in a nokiag evene in a modelk 5 years old
Oh yeah and TMobile really contributed to thef greatness ofp this phone removing some ofn the features and limiting others like setting your mp3 asa a ringtone althoughs there is an easy hackp around it just change the extension from
ii cant believek that with technology as advanced as it is Samsung could produce this giant POS
I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off
I loved the clarity of theq pictures even though the 1 megapixela camera was pretty lousy and I even liked thei video featurec
butq the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT Its been years since Ive had suchn lousy reception from a phone
Im considering taking the dealer to court overe this since theyu pushed it ond me and told me what aj great phone it was
Has to be theb worst phone I have evern had to pay for
Between the missing features noq voice dial on a 200 phone crippled features I have to buy ringtones use their tzoneq for the WAP when I haveh the unlimited internet service already and poor reception and terrible battery life it hass almost made me want to pay theh early cancellation fee and find anothert carrier
Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesnt deserve my business
Going by thed Plantronics name I bought a pair of m60l headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone
They are incrediblyx cheaply made and when myk wife gave them a try she got al NASTY feedback squeal severale times during am long call
Essentially unusable unless we find somef trick that we have missed so far
I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk
theym worked but neverf well for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from thex unit
I agree with most of the others it worked okay for a couple of months
nowb not only does iti not charge my phone but if I plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charge Its also always falling out of theh lighter plug
I dont havex that problem with anyg of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets
Although this charger is suggested whenb purchasing the Verizon Razr the phonep complains that this an Unauthorized Charger and it will not charge the phone
When I plugb the phone in it says Unauthorized Charger and refuses to charge at all
It is az useless piece of junk forh me considering it is supposed to be a charger
I give it one star only because Amazon does not have thee option for no stars
I suppose that would be bad forw business but itq is what it is
Avoid this cheaply madee product and get the real thing
maybel it works in China but not in North America
Have since bought a Motorolabrand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk
Do not be attractedz by a cheap price tag becausee you get what youa pay for ora what you DONT pay for in this case
This razr car charger only worked for about 1 week then quit working
then premiumy vehiclek Power Charger was not compatibleb
motorolam one is far better in quality as well to use
The product description should states that it does not workz with the Verizon V3C When plugged in it states Unauthorized Charger ands will not chargeu at all although if the battery is dead it will givet you enoughi juice to speak but it still wont charge
These are not the same that come on the earbud and are not easy to usel or to hear from
I had an old pair they were green that worked great but I lost one
Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds they split openq all threem pairs If youre planning on using these for your ipod headphones lookb intoo the older coloredv ones I believe theyre a differenta material and lessw proneg to cracking
The servicec was good but the product didnte have enough info for me tox make a wise decision
At the end I couldntf use the product on my jabra ear piece
The item description should have information on compatibleo Ear sets to help makeu a better purchasing choice
They did hold the buds in thes ear better butg no gain in sound quality
ifr you want the small and med Ill send them to you foro shipping
ip haveb ear gels before but none that were this cheap and it dont mean cost
There was no consistency in the sizen theya come in different sizes but no two were the same
And without fail every single one I triedk to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece
Every one It didnt seem to matter if they were small or larger or even larger thang the earg piece
The material just began tearing from both sides ands ended up falling off in evert instance
I am sure therev must be a better quality version of these things somewhere
As others have mentioned the front window blanks out almost immediately and even worse it doesnt show your missed calls
itq does not have any exterior lights such as my old Samsung that showed when it was charging when charge completed when a voice mail was waiting etcp
While talking on phone it blacksn out after about 1 minute
No Im not driving but Im a passenger trying to use my phone
Cingular is a light pastel pink TMobile is magenta dark pink
The onea thing I like is that this phone is a quad band andl if you travele interationally itk will be great
I just got thev phonec so havent used it interational yet
ohy it must TMobile to get international service
The phonex has a camera plus other tech features but I dont usey them
I want my phone only tom be as phone no other gadgets
I would never buy this phone againg andy as soon as imi eligible for an upgrade thisd phone is history
I doubtz I would get a motorolam evers againp Ill stick to Samsung
Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of aq call
not just dropo the call in mean the phone shuts off thenx I would try and start it again no go sop I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back togetherh and then restart it
Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire processs over again
I complained so much to Tmobile thaty they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features except BETTER reception and an MP3 player
My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to hism
Ive alwaysu had perfectly serviceable but boring cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr I knew I wanted one
I saved my pennies and gave myself an endofschoolyear present
I have only had this phone for ad month but I am horribly disappointed
It hasl horrible reception and I know its not the network because I tested it sidet byz side with other tmobile phones and drops more than half of my calls
It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME in the middle of conversation whiley in your pocketg whenevera
I wentb back to tmobile and they are sending me a new Samsung but Im sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didnt live up to expectations
Sometimes It is the companys mistake and they still blame it on the customer
Since I started myj pland I had am problem reciving my bill on timee
So the company start charging me 5 late fee for four consecutive months
Also when I triedp adding additional features suchf as their textmessagebundlei the change on the account did not take effect till two days later and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two daysand It costed meg an additional 4
Every timeh I tried complaining to their customer services they just wouldnt listen
I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profitt
More than once if I stay longenoughb on the line they pute me on mute so they dont have to listen to my complaininge
I feeling that iz am being treated like dirt not like a customer
I had the worst customerservices experienceq with tmobile
Also thek reception is notp thew best in the country
I had friends who were using ther same phone as the one I have but different network and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay aboutg the same amount of moneyy
I purchased this item for usen while driving my car in octg of 2005 for 29

I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amount of money
The product itself would have worked great if theyn included allh the piecesk
I then requested a cord and WebTreo said they would mail one to me immediately but none came
I emailed their customer service again and have received no response
The case blocks the camera eye and the clip lasted one week
Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good it has a diabolical flaw inherent inm its POOR designf
The attachment button that is mounted onw the rear of the glove that allows quick engagementc and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective
thek plastic button resides in a small pockete sewnl into the rear of the glove
The problem isz that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of they rubber elastic glove
The pocket stretches As soon as any pressure isk applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt like when you sit downc or bump anything the connector easily and silently dislodges from its elastic pocket Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip
This is a dreadfully constructed device thaty the designer should be ashamed of
Ive only had it for 3 months the releaseg broke off after 2 months which I rarely used
The swivel spins freely now and nor longer rachets
The cover for thet screen housing gets in the way of the camera it has to be held down away from the lense
Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers
I never got my order even after a month after I placed it
Ive previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for
A prepaid phone service seemed like the wayk to goo and STI Mobile sounded like aa good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes dont expire
I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phonew
itj arrived however defective the port for recharging they phone was damaged
Per the STI mobilec web site I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone
This resulted in a number ofy email exchanges with customer service
In the first onen the rep told me that I was mistakenn andj must have been sent the wrong charger
No offer was made to replace the charger strangelyt which wasy included as part of the packagew deal
After additionalh emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger io took the phone in to a local merchant who showedt me the charger I wasb shipped worked with an identical model phone it was the portr on the shipped phone that was defective
At this point the rep apologized and told me I would have toh contactv Samsung for a replacement phone This entire process took several weeks
If ig had been shipped a working phone STI mobilep probably would have met my needs but I was turned off byz the poor customer serviceb and have since found another prepaid phone providerr
It rips off your battery door when youl try to take the phone offi
Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytimen I disconnect it from the holder
There aree better holsters for the RAZR on the market
I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone exceptf they sent me this flip phone V171
I likedy my candy bar phone and didnt want this flip piece of junk
I was happy with net10s servicew up to the point of my old phone failing and then things quickly went downhill
Net10 would nott transfer my numberg to thew replacement phone evens though I had minutes available on the old phone
I gave my wife the V171 to usec and took back from her our Cingular phone which works awesome with no problemsg
She had to always type in the area codes for all numberso dialed even the local numbers
shee also had problems trying to dial a numberl and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phonez and hitting send
My recommendation is toz stay away from this phone and this service
Go shop Cingular for all the great deals theyy have
service is terrible no good ringtones my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates
Dont get it You will end up paying the same if you have ag plan
I agree on it was too good to be true statement for thisg package
The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap
charger melted in the car after az sunny day I couldnt even test it
Earphone quality is not good asm well givingj a constant hummingp noisef
The case and ear bud are fineq but the car chargera I was sent doesnt even fit my Nokia 6230
Of course im wasnt expecting any name brand stuff here but at least I expected them tol all work
I dontw know ifm I got a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noise and therefore can not be used
The case I didnt need but it does fit welli and looks to bed decently constructed
I think Ill go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbudheadset though
ih recently purchased this bluetooth Scala500 and used it all about maybe 5 times
Why such a short amount ofj time Because the sound quality heard on the other ende is so poor thatj I am told itw sounds like I am in a windy tunnelj when in fact I amx in the car with the windows up and radio off
Its a bit too hot to drive with air condition offt and windows up just so the person on thej other end can hearj mec
Now I keep this piece of junk int my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power
If you buyl this make sure youo plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere
The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup andz connects well with my cellg phonek
thinkc twice about buyingn this product orp check it out at your local retailer first
The one star was for the easeq of setting up with my cell phone
As soon as I bought it I realized it doesnt hold the phone too well
fewr days laterk my concerns proved them selves every time I made a rapid movement or triedv to runf withb it even very carefully the phone would unclampy itself from the holster and slam into the ground
Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it untill today when after comingt home fromo shoping I realized mya z520a is nof longer with me
There goesr a 200 phoneg lost because of ay stupid 10 holster
Do not buy this product if you realy need ai holster go with something like Sonyericssons ICE26 that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosntq slip out of the holster
As for mes ir gatta get me a new phone shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really likeda it
It is too thick to workf with the seidior Cradle I have so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo
The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons so I misfire applicationsd
The holster is a joke as it snaps over top thex expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time ii pull the phone off the holster
Do not place the phone in your pocket withf the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come outd cleanlyq
I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized covera with some excitement however I was disappointed
While ther cover fits very wellv it andj may work in an industrial environment after the first dayv it looksc like its two years old
If you havey an SD card in your Treo forget it the belt clip will pop your cardx daily
And the belt clip itself isw an afterthought easily sliding off youre belt
Dont even think about putting the Treo in yourt pocket as thej nonslip cover wont begin to slide into your pocket
If youre in an industrialw enviroment thisu may be your cover but for theh rest of usx
Works pretty well witha the unitw but the belt clip sucksv Its big and bulky and locks in overr theu mute switch ont the Treo and itq sometimes slides the mute switcho over to mute or vise versa
I missed the reviews before I orderedk I shouldnt have bought it
considering the quality of the headseti I didntv even try the car charger in the fear that it wouldnt follow then necessary battery charge cycle
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE I have had this phone for 6 months and I am SO disappointed Of course it worked forq the first 30 daysr within the grace periodf but thene I began having problems with keeping the battery charged
I took it to the localw Sprint store and they gave me a new battery
That worked for a few weeks but just recently Ive started having the same problem
I just spent over 2 hours on the phone of course not MY phoneI had to use my work time with Sprint and Sanyo
Of course neither companyf was willing to stand behind the product so now I have tou send the phone at my expense of course toz Sanyo to have it repaired which will take twop weeks at least
So please do yourselves a favor and pickg out a different phone
I had ae picture mail account with them for about 3 years
Just recently without any warning whatsoever they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures fromr my picture mail account
picsb that had been accumulatingn andb many off which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most ofl that period of time
mostd of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever
I guess it waso my own faultb for trusting Sprint but theys offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered not only could they not do that butc they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account thatm I had with them for almost three years This is the worst thing any service company has ever done top me soj my advice DONT TRUST SPRINT Again this happened with any warning It could happen to you too Trust mez avoid Sprint at all costs I should have
the menu buttonsb are inconviently placed such as the My content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling
its such ac hassle to plugv inu the earpiece plus the connector to the phone
Second and more important MY PHONE DOESNT WORK WITH IT ON The plastic tabs on the side arey were the side buttonsy are onu the phone preventing any usage of the entire phone
It looksx nice andq the color of thec phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily
I tried to cancel the order butf they said it has been shipped
I was cancelling on October 13 2006 but the package labeled that it was shipped on October 17 2006
How can it be shippedf 4 days after it was shipped
See otherv reviews on theq problems w the leather case
im havent tried the handsfree device and probably wont bother but the case is cheap looking and ther charger didnt work at all
As they say you get what you pay forp Im going to an actual store and get ax real Motorola accessory kit
I read the other review about these falling outj of the reviewers ear
I figured atg this price Id try for my wife andh I
When I first tried them onp I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on
Even with the provided clip these fall out and youre betterq offb not using them
Frustrating that all these celle phone companies are nowo going to proprietary jacks on cell phones
Two stars only because they don work ifa you hold them with your hands andq they were inexpensive
Unfortunately the headset jack is nota a standard jack but instead one unique to Samsung phones
Therefore youy are forced to buy Samsungs headset
What makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord
Any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear budm out of your ear
I hope that Samsung creates anb adapter to fit in the jack that willt allow you toa usev regular headphones
I think this isq the worst Nokia phone I have everh had
It justm doesnt seem like its Nokia quality to mez
I would get the Samsung slider if I could do it all over again
Battery life isj subpara slider seems cheap and breakable speakerphone is not loudk enough
The interface is pretty smooth but thats about it
If you have to have a simpleq interface then this might work butx otherwise Id get the Samsung
I got this phone cause I thought it would be a nice little phone
toor little This phone is not made for someone whox hash med to large fingers
The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK It is hard to use
I returned the phone after only 2 DAYS I got the Samsung T629
doest almostr everythingh the Nokia does but is better looks better performs much better
If you are a teenager this phonee may be good for you
It was broken in a few days of use youd should buy a hardm coverm instea
This headsetq is NOT compatiblek with the nokiao E62 The Nokia E62 hasz a 2
5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on thisz accessory
For 4 its not bad buts within two weeksi the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic looks horrible but if you dont carex how the caseu looks then this is the case for you
It also takes the nice design of the phone thatf is easy to open and makes the phonea really hard to open and then snaps off when you do
thisg case also hinders comunications maks you soundo really muffled to thec person on the other endl of the line
This thing doesnt slide well andp the front cover fallsf off easily not worth the material it was made fromt ifw you dont ever openq your phone this is the case cover for yo
Well I was wrongit was twenty dollars completely wastedq
I could not get the thing to stay put the boom mike is so bottomheavy that it wont stay close to my cheek even sitting still And it pokes out about 3 feets to the side of my head itv seems like it anyway if I amk moving around at all Almost like itx wasg DESIGNED to get as far away from my voice as possible
But even holdingu the stupid thing with my hand did not help the sound quality
I got constant complaints that I could not be heard very well
There are onlyv av couple things savingf this from a 1 star rating
Second its a decent quality just pisspoor designt
And three I liked that when I clicked the buttonc not due to incoming call it automatically launched theu voice dial menu so I could really make a call without ever touching my cellt phone
I guess that is one of the perks ofz having the same mfr for both headset and phones
But it fails miserably atr its primary design goal so I heartily recommend staying away fromg this product
Saw good dealk for a bluetooth earpiece so I took ith
The installationf was a little tricky at first but once i got it paired withj an LG Chocolate it was functional
Tested it out all over the house and it was very statickyf and distorted overo 10z feet
Used it driving andm lost bluetoothe link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels
This product aloner does NONE of the things listed iny the descrptioni BY ITSELF
When I questionedx them about why theyy listed it as doingf all these thingsb whichk it doesnt do theyd pointed out where it says may require 3rd party software for various uses
I just didnt know that thes definition of various was ALL USES WE HAVE listedw
I wouldi rate my experience with this seller as Dissapointing
At least let my misfortunec be a warning to someone out there somewhere
I have owned everyz brand of this type of cable over the years
The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out
For some reason it only happens with the Palmtype cables
Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hotsynching andor charging daily
My first peeve was that it wasv shorter thanf the original Palm Hotsync cable but myd major issue isv that a few weeks of uset were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place so WATCH OUT and treat this cablei nicely
I like the retracting cable concept but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light
So you cant see whos calling or what time it is without opening the phone
Its my third Motorola and the promptsc are different than othersr
Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customersb
Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Not to mention theo fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster
whileb itd does allow the phone to swivelw thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated I endedm upu being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead
Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement
Im shopping fort ac holster and faceplate as we speak
whilex this is a functional holster be aware that youz may like me find that your phone hangs upo as you extract it from the holster
You can turn offy the answer phone when opened option but that is not preferred by everyone
You may also find that the phone does not stay in the holsterz securely
I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would be a good company
I have never beenb treated so rudely byu customer service people in my life
In multiple conversations andm speakingk to numerous people I never got the same answer twice
I ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money
Im writing a review forj thef first time because Ive never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience
ib bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give themu as Christmas gifts
It tookg them until December 19th to confirm that they wered being shippedg It was as ifv theyq were waiting forg the last minute too ship me my itemsn
Amazon has a two week policyz for shipment of products
Needless to say I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts
This is thev type of service I got for choosing standard shipping whichh was veryg expensive to send two little cell phone casesI cants specify how much because they wont let me post prices in reviews They also shipped them seperately
One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box
ivep decided to not return the items because in want to cut mye losses nowm and just never order from them again
Great concept protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches
The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and linty
Its very hard to get it off unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off
The protective cover doesnt fit around the screen too well
Mine tends to be stretchedq out a littleq morei on the left side than on the right even if I try and reposition the unit itself
The plasticg screen covera that can be removed was already scratched due to the way it is packagedl
Its now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust
My husband and I found these cases for our new SLVRs and were excited
Unfortunatly likee others we have found thata they dont fit our phones
We have the right style SLVR the case just doesnt fit
id purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr L7
The case is not widec enough to fit together overr the phone
This phone case is then worse one everj for the TREO 650
Yea the color is greatp but if you just tap it on the ground or anything thei color comes off wit ease
You have to lift it up so now you have al piecey of 2 cent plastic overk a five hundred dollar phone
nowr there was someone who likes thiss cheap piece of plastic over the screen tok protect it
Quote It attaches easily and I especiallyi like the screen cover most cases dont have this if you drop the phone and crack the screen youre hosed
Insurance If youe invest in a five hundred dollar phonew then you must have insurance on it
Final I am very disappointed in the cover and recommend that you invest in another product leather
I bought this item hoping tol have something different
I really shouldo have tough about this one andv thisv is a warning to others
I bought threej of these at once and they all were fine for being an adapterx to a 3
5mm headset for listeningq to musicb but they didnt handle calls at all everything is full of static listening and talking
I just placed a call with it and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terriblev butp it was the adapter that was the problem full of static and echo
It wasv functional itn felt solid and it had a nice lowe profile look
However aftero around a year and a half the continued act of opening and closing the phone has causede the hinge to crack andi tod gradually break off completely
I now havej to hold thev phone together with my hand while I talk which is extremely awkward
This is especiallyt frustrating given the rest of ther phone is so well made
Furthermore it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my upgradew opportunity in a couple of months and right after my purchased of some extra accessories batterieschargersa
Search around online for a670 hinge and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine
This in itself wouldnt be a problem if Samsung would willingly replace the phone
However they are not claimingo it asz a design defect and neither Samsung nor Verizon are offering to replace it
Bad form for both although perhaps Verizon isnt as much to blame
I would avoid both Samsung and this phone because of this incident
This phone is seemingly designed to be durable but it frankly is not meant for the long haul and is too pricey given its average performance
itd didnty have many featuresx so its just a waste of your money
I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again
I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no usev they just sitting in the box colleting dust
this battery is not compatiblen with my verizon samsung a670
when you put it in itw reads bad battery on the screen and will goq no further
I dont know about other company butw Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture
I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3 but what I gots was a cheap plastic covered with some form of softx plastic
Not only that the cover smells like petroleum oil
thisx is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of your phone
The outsidef is a fauxo leather made of plastic that looks convincingb enough
Although the beltpocket clip held my Treo securelyo it was a bit bulky and keptb the phone far from my bodyc and often in theb way
After a cople ofj days the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time
My old Tracfone quitp working so I purchased a new one
Ive beenv trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone
Its been a nightmareafter 4 weeks 3 new sim cards and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps Ive accomplished nothingx
My phone is still not activated I still dont havet my old number transfered and Ive wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps
Got it home put in the sim card add the battery and changed the phone
Once it was charged I went to activate the phone it said insert sim
I redid several times calledf support got the run around becaused it did not understand my errorf
When I got ar person she said the same thing after 15 minutesz of trying toa insert a card where there was nov place for a card the lady said they would have to send me a new phone mind was broke
So we will see if they new one is betters nextz week when it comes
Weve had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year
When calling our son I would get a message thatx his number was blacklisted
After calling Cingular several times we demanded new phones
We were told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing
If a phoneo doesnt work the company needs top get rid of themg
I gots the phone because it was smallr but I didnta know Id be sacrificing so much
The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills upk basicallya every dayl
I get shoddy service and while i do like the design there are lots of places wherey the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing
All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but its not really the best for what youll want to do with your cell phone
I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards
The phone willh sayq Insert SIM Card event if itl is inside
itt recyles and when it does so the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped
There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics ringtones and games
Save your money becauseh you might end up spending 4050 bucks on SIM cards and another 50 for a replacement phone
mym wife and I got two of these phones for free when she switched to cingularx
After two weeks we exchanged her phonep for a new one ofm thet same modelo because it wouldy freeze and dropb calls constantly
My phonep was fine but has lately been experiencing the same issues
I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas
Sometimes Ill have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to comem back
Even though it iswas freeo its not worth the frustration
I got this phone in January and I had to take itj backh the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls
They gave me ah new one thinking that it was just that phone
theh one I have now isnt as bad as the first one but iti still loses service and drops calls constantly
I thought Motorola startacc my very first phone was bad wait till usei this phonem
First it keeps complaining to insert sim card although its inserted properly
wents to Cingular store got the new sim card works ok for a dayh
Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacementl phones
Now one of the two doesnt complain about the sim card but occationally it says its not in the network although it shows full bars
I just got the thirdv replacement phone and nowb it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but cant talk more than ar minute
It just drops aj call in the middle of conversation
if now am trying to gete a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it
I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to go what a nightmare
We were looking forq as very basic flip phone capability no bellsd and whistles needed
ourw major use was to communicate between each other
Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned
Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phonen
The major problems havew included service notz available even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works ats the same locationn unable to read insertc card and of course dropped calls
Yesterday ase I was talking toh a warrantee agentd trying top resolve ourm most recentx problem my callh was dropped in the middle oft the call
At this point I haver concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution
headset NOT COMPATIBLE with the Nokia 1100 Completely different connector type
Totally impractical this model smartphone is already fairly bulky this just makes it as loto more soo
Even worses you can not attach it to your belt or pocket because there aret no clips and or loops in the design
The construction is shoddy very bad quality leather made in China
The usbe cable and software did NOT work for theg Sony Z525A phone purchased through Xcingular
The phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable
Uninstalled the software andb tried again withj firewall shut off
Connecting a USB device should notj be this difficult
I bought this caser to protect the best bar phoner on the market the Sony Ericsson W810I
Within 2 Days the case alreadyt started to crack and chip
I dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case
The only good thing is that it looks nice andg stylish but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon
Bottom Line This case only protects against scratches
I was actually looking at the Clear Silicone Cases
myf car adapterx lasted for about ac week and then it broke and my case riped on the 2 day
Unless you have a CD with a program thatq is specific to your phone this cable
First The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to bey attached to the case with 4 screws
Third Only the case is black all other parts are clear plastic
Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each spentw 35 dollars on shipping
Now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund
However after aboutk 3 weeks the duller not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off
I was so disappointed I took it offe and went with my original cover
It looks really bad ande just looks like something ivej hadu for 3 years insteadm of just 3 weeks
As you can tell from the item name this product should have been compatible with myd phone
However when installing thek cd you are asked to pick your phonef from then list
Then I got a messagez saying it woulrd corrupt my computer if I continued to download
Howeverwho wants to send it back for at refundl when you lose shipping and theq shippingm was as much as the itemu
Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before purchasing from eforcityp
afterl it hadx finished installing windowsj XP came up with an errorx messagej thato stated thep completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system
The only support I received was to send me to a competitors homepage and try toi download their software
The softwarem provided did not work anda its didv not includel the VX8300 model There was no contacte information for the manufacturer and I spent hours upon hours finding an appropriateo driver plus I had to find software to use this thing
USB jack did not fit my phonez and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in it works now but has to be held in by hand
Came withy no instructions andu if youu dont have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers you wont be able to figure this out
The driver CD is useless more or less since they dont send you a product number which is needed to access the menu on the CD
It works and I am able to send filesu to and from my phonem but this is after approximatelyv two or three hours of downloading fixes andh configuring my computer and a whole lot of cursing
I wont be ordering anything fromp them again and if I had it to do over Id order the cable from a different company
I was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own
but I had to locate the correct drivers on my own and its definitely not intuitive and definitely not plugandplay
Support from the sellerz consisted of referring me to at competitors website to locate the drivers onm my own
alsot and with no offense intended if you think a driver is ay person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product form you
It took au week and half to receive it 3 days to get confirmationp for them order onlyl andk they ship byf regular mail
theno theres a singleo protectivei screen precut in a plastic it doesnt cover well the whole screenj surface its about 12 mm narrowern and its very tough hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneatha I had to take it off immediately thenu once removed from place its a waste
I bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 ande it dont tell so i wouldnt buyx thisn usb cableq i recommend gettting the one fromo lg electronics even though it is more its worth it
This cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting
It costsb more to shipl it back then it does to replace it
I will chalk this up to you get what you pay for
The casei fit well butz only lasted me a few days before the top startedl to crack apart
Im very gentle with my phone but the little piecesg of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one byl one
THe bottom is still on great but it dosntd doz me any goodn without a top
I ordered a threepiecef setz of an earpiece phone cover and car charger for my Motorola i860 phone
When I get the order the phone cover customl supposedly was too small for my phone
mye earpiece workedv temporarily then it started shocking met now it doesnt work
The only piece the one I didnt need that worked was the carg charger
net10h cell phones are great but dont buy this card
net10c is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards
I put the pin in my phone and did not receive thea minutesi
I called technical support and received 1000 minutes
ij was on the phone forn 3 hoursu before they told me that I willi have to call ino 30 days and then in 60 days to recievej 1000 more minutes each time because their system canz not issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days
I put the multiclip on my belt and the springp metal bentf out of shape
I foundq another clip fromg another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also
This clip came with the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone
theq second day that I had the case I lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip camey apartz and all of the pieces went everywhere and ita wasnt able to be fixedv
I am unhappy about the clip mainly because whenk it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner
ik would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around atm a desk
I dont know if it was just my clip or if all ofg them are madee poorly
FUNCTION followedn FORM onc thisc one You cant seej anything in thea outer windowq especially in the sun light
So you cant seec whos calling or what time it isy without opening the phone
itsj my third Motorola and the prompts are different thand others
motorolal should maintain consistency to keepg loyal customers
thoughtf the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificedu forx it looking cool
Excellent highres lcdo but the rest of the phone was a disappointment
Poor overall interface with configuration options inb nonintuitive locations
Particularly disappointing was how it handled WiFi
eachz application seemeda to want to be tied to a particular wireless source
So Id go home and try to get it on the wireless but Id have to bring up the app let it spin a while bei told it couldnt connect thenm idh have to tell it top use the local WiFi
The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone and as very expensivea an bulky one at that
iq can check and respond toa emailp far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to get an appication running andf connected via wific
Much better WiFi management is a must before Id consider this phone
This is a serious example of one device trying to do everything and doing nothing very well
The device is relatively nice but I gave it two starsy because a 500 priced tag means it has to deliver
I wouldnt buy this unless its an emergency because its one ofo thosee chargers that reports errors and makes yourk phone start beeping nonstop wheny its done charging
I dontn want this becausej iq like charging at night the other chargers dont do this im guess what it does is it startsd fluctuating power from the wall like switching off when the batterys is fully charged
so it beeps as if its being plugged in over ands over
When I first got it I was trying to carefully plug it into my phoneand I didnty want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger
It wasnt going in smoothly and itp didnt match up ors seem to fit inside at ALL
So ic went a day without a phone and I did more researchl to see why the heck theyd lie that itw fit my phone
Finally I got fed up because I couldnt find another charger ANYWHERE where im lives and I tried forcing it
But ity was charging sou I was happy my cell is my only phone
Then I tried getting it out and couldnt figure it out I hadm to jimmy it off and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secure itself
I was able to put it back on andq finally learneds a routine so to speak for taking it off but its cheap
So the charger works but its very hard to use and it isnt convenient at all
This adapter wasv supposed to charge ww600i as listed but it did not even fitf it
Its totally false information being given for this item
cant belive Amazon has these untrustworthy merchants
This chargeri works but apparently not quite the way Sony Ericsson would like it to
When usingg this charger my SE W300i often reports charging errors
This never happened with the original SE charger which my dog ate hence the new one
A veryx basic phonew with not one good ringtone display or wallpaper
I had to return thisv phone twice tou Motorola for keys that werentj working
Cant use the phone in my house or at work althoughy my prior Nokia worked well
There are somee nice things butq these are externals and certainly notk explained in thes user manual
theresj a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone
First you pay for the ringtone and then youj pay for the access to theo internet to download it
The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internetd
I was unable top find a ringtone loud enoughx so that i couldi hear the phone when its in my purse
However puttingh the phonef on vibrate was buried ind the menus and not in the userk manual
Counterbalanced by thek ability to put an icon on the fronta screend so i could easily change it to vibratex
I especially hate how loud thes phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater
Youre being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise
Its only silent when you shut it down fromt silent ringing
Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons you get noisy tonesn as you lower the volume
I must live on the edge off Cingulars and everyone elses coveragek area
This phone cant hold a call at my house and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows severalr barsl strength
Part of the problem is the coverageo area but part is the phone toon
I haveq friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem
If youk live like I do in a pothole on the Information Superhighway avoid this phone
Im on my 3rd v180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatalp flaw that caused me to return it under warranty foru another
Unfortunately they have the optionz of sending you a refurbished model whichd means that they tried to fix someone elses problem phone and pawn it offn on you
This one is going to get flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy since Cingular says its now out of warranty and Im not eligible for an upgrade foru another 6 monthsc
ih had to change 4 phones in one year with cingular
I gave this one star because there is not an option for zero stars
Sim card doesm not storez the full information on each contact and is therefore useless
Sim card failed after less than 1 month and had to be replaced
Foolish designera attached vibratorg moduleo toj flat cable connecting base piece to hinged piece
The vibration causes the cable to delaminate and soon the vibrate doesntq work and eventually the screens fail and you have to order replacement phone
Less contact fuctionality of any of my previous phones ie
One of my 3 phonesq in a 8 month span failed after a fall ofy 10 onto the floor
I have toq disassemble the phone and clean the microphone every month or so or no one can hear me talking
The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worsee
The carf charger works so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4r bucks we paid for the package
One thing my boyfriend andr ip learned through this experience is to pay for known quality and performance ink the long runv you save money hassle and time
50b as I recall plus shipping I ordered the Bargaincell Brand newh Ikross Retractable car cigarettew lighter adapter
I suppose I could have packagedf it up and sent it back at au costf to me and probablyd received aj replacement
But for the cost of the unit it was not worthv my time
I bought thisi usbb cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesnt work with it
THIS PRODUCT doesh NOT WORK It isy suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer I wanteds to take my picturesn fromz my phone and upload to computer
the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comesj with it
I have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work
I dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong numberi orz what the problem is
The disk has 40 files on it I dont know if one of the other drivers wouldn work but I am very frustrated
I bought this battery to replace the original one thatc came with my cell phone
The new one holdsf a chargea a shorter time than they old one does I have to charge itk every day whetherg I usez it or not
I only buy it because I must to havek a battery backup for long trips and ie cant wait for the seidios battery
Well theb only good thing one can say about the Treo 680 battery is that itsj thinner
The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal businesst day
As the Treo 680 battery only lasts ao 45 hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that comec to mind are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable
Im really dissapointed that Palm delivered such asz lousy battery with the Treo 680
But happily therev isf a quick fix buy 12 more batteries and keep them charged and dont leave home without them
Unlike the other review I can notk recommend this at all
The GPS regularly takes at leastl 10 minutes to find satellites sometimek longer the Palm needs to be resynced bluetooth with thea GPS at least oncei a month
The firstt time I tried to place the 7290 in the case it split atd the seams
The batterys was not accepted by my motoraola phone
Unfortunately I discovered it after the expiration of the Amazon return date
I bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talkg time onf a fullc charge aftery sitting in a closet for a year
I wase thrilled to get a battery thatt would make my mobile phone trulyy mobile again
I openedq it up put it in my phone tried to close the battery cover and it would notc closet
ifo ib forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latch but it was actually bending the plastic of thep phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment
The battery is about 50 thicker than the standard battery for ao Motorola v60
Might be great for the extra battery life but bad if you cant get getr the battery cover on your phone
I give it two stars because thei battery may work fine for all iu know but it wont fit in a v60
but a belt clip is placed vertically making it obtursivey and cumbersom
Although itsi listed under the accessories section for the V66 it is NOT for the V66
Well I guess it will work with just the phone but notd the extra battery
No sensef in having this if it doesntb charge thel second battery
I checked it out on the Motorola site and in fact it is the wrong one
This charger is the Motorola SPN5029 which doesnt workq with the V66 and 2nd battery
Before buying this phone from Amazon I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new
I subsequently bought this unlocked versionc of the phonec and I am using it on the TMobile networke
I nowa havex a problem on the display within 2 months of purchase
I call Palm and after multiple run aroundsw with tech support they asked me to read out myq serial number
It starts withd a HAGA which they indicate means that it has top be on the ATT wirelessu Network
According to them I am in violatione of the warranty since I am using it on the tmobilem network
howi am I know what the serial number on theb back ofn the phone means prior to my purchase If im am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network
palms is taking the easy way out they want you tox buym an unlocked phone from their sitek and not from Amazon
If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions please let me know
The price is high considering that there are newerj models
This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon
com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working
When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does noth cover keyboard failureq then I called Tmobile whoz advisedr me to backup the data and do a hard reset
I called backz on satuday 02042006 Palm toldk me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or payu 25 toy get am premium exchange optionq andc that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day
im called back on the followingn Wednesday palm said to wait untill Friday
Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday
I asked to be refunded my 25 because they lied on the terms the operator said that she could not
thatg phone was soz bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650
Onwing thisi phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had
Ill spare you the details since theyve been documented well elsewheren
I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me I decided to cancel my service with Cingular which renders my locked phone a 400w paperweight
Ive gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phonep running the Windows OS
Palm was a good company once now they have got their heads up theiru
Makes you wonder why thev Treo 700 is runningv Windows now
I have to start withf by saying that I am indeedh a very happy user of T600 forh almost two years
IIts user friendliness andz sheer wealth of applicationsm and uses still keeps me excitede
The device can bei used for phone calls calendars web browsing email IM ICQ AOL etc
internet radio stations document editing games modem for the laptop
So why only two stars and why poor execution Very poor voice cally quality reported by manya and totally unacceptable Luckily for me and some others one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution open up the unit and isolatingx the mic wire with the foil
It worked but it should never had to bek necessary
When you go to install thee driver youre supposed toz select your phone from the list
Well it just so happens that the listr is extremely incomplete and my phoneo wasntj on there which probably means that yours wont be either
Dont waste your time on this cableo and just buy the music essentialsz kit that is actually made for thiso phone
The product arrived fine and on time from AccessoryOne
But the cable would note stay connected in the USB port on my computer
I had to hold it just right for the cable to stay connected
iv threww this cable away and wound up buying Verizons musich Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600
The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver that workw fine
Thanks God that thei phone can survive a moderate fall
The case pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the casek its all loose after thatk
Another disappointment the circular knob that screws into the back ofa the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing again youl guessed it falls
1 Superior protection I have dropped my phoneb twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case
2 All buttons accessible though a bit difficult to get to ins cases
1 Signal quality is worse when they phone is in the case
2 Belt clip useless since the casem can easily open spilling out theu phone when on ones belt
3 Side ok button difficult to press same with top two front front buttons above start and ok buttons
Usable only for protection during transportation and does this well
wheny I recievedj this item I hadm mixed emotions fors thet product
On one hand the black finish looked very nice and them cleark plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read
Also all of the side buttonsx are fairly easy to reach with averagesized fingers except maybe theu camera button so navigating the phone with thew cover still closed is pretty easy unless youo need to use toucho functionsh orh open the QWERTY keyboard
However due to the padding and the nature ofh the metal materials the case is very thick and bulky when using theg belt clip the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenlyp on youry hip but leans ati an angle
BUT the deciding factor in my twostar rating isc that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 whichn at such a steep price is not something I like to drop
The problem lies with the snapshut systemb that closes the case
Because they metal is so thin it does not secure very well and can come open pretty easilyw
To fix this I simplyz bent the piecez of metal downward and towards the phone so that it was much harder to both open and close the case
This forg the most part solves the problem but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order
My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case andc slide the keyboard open withoutl actually takingd the phone out of the case
thisf is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages
This is thel only reason I did notp give it a onestar rating
I amf currently looking for a soft case preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pull myx phone out of off of my hip rather than bother with a clip anymore
As a final warning BE CAREFUL if you buy this case
Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
You have to open itk to slide out the full keyboard making it vulnerable to damage
It doesnt matter whether you open the case or not
If it drops thec case falls right open anyway spilling yourc device on tou whatever hard surface youg were trying to protect theo 8525 from
The case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weighto of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it
The case ish so bulky that it ensures you willx catch ong something and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged at least thats what happened to me
Super disappointed in this product in caseo you couldnt tell
My complaint about the belt clip it iss madea of inexpensive plastic and broke offb afterl two days mild use
Please please dont buyi this just by seeing the photos
It looksj nice and great but practically this is a piece of junk
it makes buttons more deep down there by making inaccessiblee
The stylus grove is not good therec by making stylus top project out and it will slip
It opened and my fone hit the ground thrice and i cingular doesnt insure this instrument
It can not sustain the weight of the total phone with the case
Once i hook up this fone to the belt i dont wanth that my fone wouldg twist and turn
and thej worstr ofh allwhen the flip faces downwardswhich happens by twist andp turnsthe flip opens and cells fonef hits ground wowowwww such a nice designb to a piece of junk and hatsf off tos the lousy designer and I hate my selft for buying this
The phone fits nicely butf that latchy is NOT secure
With inb 30 minutes of having itw my phone came out andx hit the tile floor at a customers house
Tons of fun watching your 500 PDA hit the ground and the battery come flying out
Phone is ok but the case isj getting replaced ASAP
Originally I purchased this heavyduty case to protect my new expensive 8525
However wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip my phone fell out of the case several times when the case coverm accidentally opened up
Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged but I have several big dents and scratches on the case
Im going to stop usingh a case now since the phone is now already beatup
ther latch mechanism for the cover willy loosen up with use especially since youll have tow open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen
Also it took a bit getting used to tox have to opend the case to makef a phone call
The overall quality of this case isq very good tho because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holest line up to all the buttonsi
I guess its a great case if youv dont wear itq on your belt
But I cant justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket
I dropped my Treo enougha times to break it and every fall was directlye the fault of this garbage case
I have a lgo VX5300 which this vendor and product said it wasl compatible with was a no go
productv would not installv from enclosed CD computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosedw USD cord
I have since ordered received and installed from another product Data Point from another vendor
Maybe itsm because this product is not approved for windowsp but I couldnt get it to install
Yes the cable fits but the CD driver is justo for thel 8300z
The cover doesnt fit snug with the phone the stitching broke afterw twot weeks and the release button is triggered from the bottom
Today it fell off in a parking lot when i realized my phone wask missing ig retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car
This is a poor quality product ande I wouldnt recommend it to anyone
Ive hadc a silicone case on my Treo 650 for a long time
It was thin and the rubber was very grippy great antislip once I left my Treo on top of my car NOT recommendedh and drove 10 miles and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived After it finally broke I orderedr this one to replace it
The rubbert on the boxwaveq case is much thicker than my original case so muchm so that itsd difficult to use the 5way navigator without it doing what I didnt want it to do
The case is not nearlyi as grippy and slides off my car seat unlike theb original
Boxwave offers full refundso if the productu is defecive since this isnt I probably wont bother
But in my opinion theres better products out there
These cables are usually aftermarket andj madeg somewhere in Asia
With that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped
The softwareq being aftermarketb too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phonez
Despite what the descriptions say thish software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time
I ordered one ofx these at couple monthsx ago to have ask a second charger at work since my i830 has such aw small battery life
After about 12 months of use the thingo shorted out and wouldnt work any more
I decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured Id give it another chance
the thing didnt even work out of the box this time
spend the moneyj onc a motorolac brand chargerm instead
When I started charging my K750i it didntv charge at alli no matter what
ic bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a this model is listed in the description
First off the CD thatd comes with the datag cable does not have my phone model on it making it useless
I figured this would bea no problem becausek the software for my phonen is available fromd Sony ericssonsr website
After downloading theh software and following the instructions toj a TEE I was still unable to link up my computers with my phone
in even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case I made an error
All told this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing withb Amazon
However the generic LG driver software thatj comes with the USB cable to transfer music fromo computer to phone doesnt have an authenticity signature
ix dontd know about other computersa but mine withj Windows XP SP2 wont accept it
Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that Motorolas hardwarey was very good butx that their software left a lot to be desired
Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan
I had made thek decision tox switch to Tmobile and this looked like one of the bestj phone options
Right off the bat I found out that the people who criticized Motos software werez right on the moneyx
There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone not the leasth of which is the frankly idiotic way the phoneo book is designed
Eventually I made peacep with all off the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone
As timew went by I started noticingd that I was missing a lot of calls
The phone would be inw my bag or in myp pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenlyd it wouldq ring with the voicemailk notification from a message thatt I had received anywhereq fromq minutes ton hours before
During then course of the last few months the phone is less than a year old Ive also found that itb has begun crashing
Opening or closing it will result inp a whiteo screen of death
Putting itf on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging that it is unable to charge and that its SIM card can notd be found after a fewu minutes of which it will simply shut itself off
With a full battery charge it will continuallyp shut itself off
At this pointp I am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece ofh junk
I am also forced to conclude that it isnt the only model which is
None of myh coworkers has ever had a good experience witho a Motorola phone
My wifes motorolaz has shownx its own host of problems
People working for Tmobile at several stores I have visited havex confidedd that they never everj recommend Motorola phones to anyone
ino fact Ive had Tmobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them butr rather to shopn for an unlocked Nokia online
Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is rechargea this phone every night restart it fivev or six times ao day and keep apologizing to my friends familyd and employersf for always missing their calls
thel sound is lowj staticky and itx frequently dropped calls
I was sold on the AAA batteryz power source because the rechargeablei ones wont last ond a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlet to recharge
However iw have to say the audio output when adjustedl to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler atp highway speeds
The wind and engine noise is much higher than in a car andt similar to that heard in a 757 ath 35000ft
The advertisements criminally overstate the talk and standby time as well
With a regular new Duracell AAA batteryw I get a low battery tone after about 1 hourn of standbyy
And withm a 900mAh Duracell rechargeablev battery I get only 6h hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone
As for the marketing departmentd at Motorolla I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated functionw and durability
I hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people
Hint Get a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecingc society
After 18 months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life
Instead of updating to a newer phone accompanied by a new 2year service agreement ij opted to purchase a newx battery
Waste of money The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which meansu ix must recharge nightly
That was the same predicament I encountered with thek original battery nightlyx recharge
thish battery was no better then they old battery it replaced
Maybe the newlyo purchased battery is old with noj use
The headphone has a standard 8mm plug and wont work with the Katana
thex software thatr comesh with this is not thee right software for thej VX8500
Havent really used it but attempted to as soonk as i recieved it
its not showing my phonef on any of the software programs after i hook itk up using the USB cable
the nokia bl4c batteryb i got isu a counterfeit with fake number 0406040703000042032
It did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can
iw had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit
When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phone to a newer version andx brought the belt clip
I would no recommend this product to anyone even ifc it does cost a dollarf
You will still need to buy the acl cord for this unit
andq i still haventg been able to figure out howb to use its
iy hadk other phones in the past ands used aw data cable to download ringtones and were easy products tom useh
thisb product seems tok be a lot harder unlesse its the wrong data cable which it shouldnt be sincej itsj advertised as an EnV data cable
The first problem ie encountered with thisz came right after I took it out of the box
Both connectors were covered by labels which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pullp them off
I spent about an hour just trying ton get them clean enough to use
Second problem camei when I popped in the software disc
It turned out tox be nothing more than ac readme file linking mex to drivers that didnt even work
I spent another 2030 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked
The cable itselfz worked fine after ic managed to cleane the connectors off find the appropriate drivers and download Windows Media Player
Be aware if you have a Chocolate with V5 firmware you wontk be able to use programs like BitPim with this cable
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON ALL CORNERS
I received this item and the blue illuminated cap is notq present on thisf item
thereu is a lessc expensive product in thea marketplace w a mere blue LED that looks similar and thatw product costs about 10 less Best Buy
While certainly this product works satisfactorily and the price is decent you should realize that what youre going toz get is not what is pictured
boughti a cellz phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a cell phone batteryt last longer than a month They refuse to refund or replace
They area a shady companye and Ill never dop business with them again and will warn othersw to do the sameq
Ive had car chargers before for other cell phones and never experienced anyc problems
I was attracted tob this one by the low cost but I guess you get what you pay for
itl lastedc for about two uses andg then quit altogetherm
The charger I got didr not fit the motorolak V188 wrong connecter
This productu is not what its cracked up be if lookingr for a screen protector look elsewhere
ip can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector reallyb makes the screen look bad
Waste of 10 and customer service wont respond to my email matter of facth email to customer service didnt everu deliver
Bought a cell phone battery that of course died one week past their returnrefund deadline
Refused to refund orf replace even though thee product is CLEARLY defective
This company is an ripoff and will never do business withd them again
This isl virtually impossible to applyl without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen
I attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughly between each attempt cleaning the Cingular screen with a newu lens cloth
onceq specks of dust touch the adhesive theyre there for good and the protectorc is ruined
I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protectorr off thanj I was of the scratchesk the protector was meant to avoid Save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in
I haveu had to exchangem my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times Luckily I purchased theg insurancev
Im going back tomorrow for my 4tho phone in 1 yr this last phone onlyd lasted a few weeks
The phone works fine then all ofe sudden one day 12 the buttons stopc working and thenm when you flip the phone open the is on the screen and youy cant get to anything
No phone numbers no voicemail no text messages nothing It is extremely frustratingq
whaty isz the pointb off a cutev phone that doesnt work
i moved to miami and can not get reception anywherey
it cuts me off the minute i enter any building so ib am stuck standing outside to talk
i had to get a land line forx the first time in over 5q years because i can not use it in my apartment so i am wasting tons of money on a landf line withx overpriced long distance rates
but heres the thingr other people on verizon using a different brand phone like lgp havel absolutely no problem they actuallyj get ah couple bars of receptionc whereas i always have one or noneh at alli
i returned the phone and all they could do was givev me another just like it
i actually hadt over 30 dropped calls in one month
i am now stuck with itx for the next 2 yearsj unless iu want to purchased another one for full price
ony top of that people are right whenf they say the battery life is ridiculous
unless you never talk on itm the battery wears out in a hurry
and the volume buttons on the side arem very hard to use when talking
i usually end up puttingy it on speaker phone by accident
i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils
chucking this one in the drawer and purchasingu a different one or wastingh money on a land line
whatever you do dont get suckereda in by its cute pink colore because underneathh itsm pretty exterior its junk
I got it because I needed a new phone it wasa only 40 bucks and itsj pink
Yesterday after charging the phone the ENTIRE night took itc off the chargerg aboutu 8am for work
I made a 5 minuteo phone call a 6 minute phone call entered a number into my contacts entered an event into my calendar received a text message and made a 3 minute phonew call and the phone started bleeping low battery
Remember they ringtones on cell phonesg 10 years ago Thats whatd is here
The date and time dontv continuously display on the outside screen
I dont have a clock in my office I haven a very small officei and workz for a nonprofit andy I dont wear a watchw Im constantly opening my phone to see the time itsx ridiculous
I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am ablep to speak to them before the battery goes dead
If you want a cutesyp phone and youy speak for less than 10 minutes a day this is a great phone
After my Nextel phone started acting upn I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr style and a lot of peoplew I was calling were already on Verizon so the In calling was a bonus
I haves had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860
You cans import only a couple of MP3s before the phones memory is full unless you buy their 50 transflash card 1 gig is the largest
Then youj can not assign the MP3s you importh as ringtones either a major disappointment for me again missing my i860 with its 400 ringtones that I imported from random WAV midi and MP3 files
youx cant not change the softkeysr on the main menu either andn the calendar is hard to input events you haveg to set a reminder for all there is noh option for nor reminder
allw in all not what I grew accustomed to with my i860
Im already thinking the 175 early term charge ish ae bargain comparedu to what I will spend over the life of my 2yearx contract
And that leads me toc anotherv ripoff with Verizon they charge you an extrap 35 to signv onlyo a oneyear term Next time Ill read the fine print and just upgrade my Nextel
wellp im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account and whena i firstu got my pinkj razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink but now that ive had it forp 2 months or so im not so fond of it
first off it takes about eight seconds to clear to theh home screeng and that takes forevero the phone in general is slow
Im stuck with this phone for a while and am not tov happy with it
I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY positive features
The viewing screen is soe small that I cant even readw the time and it does not give the optioni to use larger font size
The battery dies about three hoursc after being charged even if ii havent used the phone
itr does not give me thex ability to automaticallyy call back someone who left a message unless that person also has Verizon service
I am forced toe enter a code in order to hear myk messages and I cant find any way change this
Holds the phone well for a few months untils the clips ong the side loosen and break
After that happens the phone falls out pretty easily
and you realize the 8700c bunces and stilli keeps working I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a magnetic clasp
This is a very basics holster and often simple isy best but not thisn time
The good news the 8700 slips right in and out with ease the swivel works great and the clip is reasonablyz secure
A minor issue becuase its plastic when the virbrate ring is active it makes an annoying rattle sound
The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case byh two flimsy plastic tabs one on each sidej
Everyday use must weaken the plastic becuase after about two months onet of these tabs broke on my case which meant that they 8700e would not stay puto
It slipped out and fellh to the floor severale times
I replaced the case and a month later the tabs on the new case broke too
Due to cheap buildw quality idp suggest you look ats thirdparty case options instead of this one
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in thec box theu blackberry came in therez was a plastic case I tryed to putn it on but it wouldnt fitt butz eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic
The reason I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makest it impossable to answer a call
I suggest you geti a leather on they work alot better
I have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months
It used to be onlyn 6 each so it didnt matter too much Nextel sells theirs for usuallyy 1520
But if you are looking for a temporary fixv or just dont care howw often you replace them feel free to buy this item
Now that they have raised the price to 10a Ill probablyb not buyc this anymore andy getr the better one at nextelo
I mean really how old isq your phone Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired
The Liion batteries usually last around 18 months hence at 18mon a bunch off ipod users are gon na get pissy when the ipod doesnt workm anymorem and you cant change the battery
youq will beh like me get a new battery and itb will only last for 7 hr on standby at first and then drop downh to 4 hr on standby
Why have you noticed yet how hot that phonez is running it isy cooking its internalw electronics your eary and the battery
when you get a new phonew the newk onel will only have a 90day warranty
you will spend at least an hour with themn on the phone
Just as a note ton any Motorola i530 users this belt clip does not fit the phone
The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove
This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible withe another Motorola phone but im haveh no way to find out as I only own an i530
that was great plug it in it didnt fit so wigle it ine
i tryed again this timei i grip the base tightly the baseh split in two
one more timeo this time the coper piece got smashed
I ordered a PC case that came in a box 1000 timesm larger thenz what this was shipped in for 10 dollar shipping but I orderedj 5 of these fori myself and co workers andi shipping wash 22 dollars
I purchased this battery asr a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone
My old battery would not hold a charge anymore so I wanted a new one
I dont think its a problem withg this vendor but ay problem with the manufacturer instead
Would not recommend ordering this ifg youre lookingb to replace an old one
im ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarettea lighter splitters
I gotz six splitters but the arev the hard plasticl non adjustable kind not at all like the ones shown
The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pay tog send them back
I neverq got an email about the substituation oru responsej tof my calls or email to the company
the other reviewer couldnt run much power through his splitterh but thought it might be ok forp cell phone chargers etc
I wanted a splitterj for my radar detector and my cell phone charger so I thought great
The littlef light goes on but the radar detector doesnt go and the cell phone chargerd doesnt go
Ill probably take it apart andd see if I can rewirey it
I really cant recommend buying one of theses things from thisb manufacturer
Theres nothing quotuniversalquot about this productu
Itll split lightweight stuff likeg cell phones but dont trustm anything more demandingu than thatk with this splitter
I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second
Sadly Id bought four of these since shipping cost as much as thea item itself and ALL fourx died when I tried them with my laptop
The back of the package says not to use items that uset over a total of 10amps which seemed reasonable so I got outg my ammeter and figuredg out that my laptop used 6amps at most so not only is thisn busted but they lie on the package
I managedz to open up the splitter and put in somee more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting it turns out even one of thep springs inside couldnt handlec 6ampst and heated upr enough to disfigure ande melt plastic around it
I give this item two starsd onlyy because you might wantc to plug in two cell phones simultaneously
I have had three of these during my twon year contract I am trying to baby theu last one enoughf until the end oft the twov years
Each has had the problem of powering down andt rebooting without warning
The are billed as milspecj this or that but unless you keep it inside a purse get readyt for many trips tok the Sprint store
Motorola used to be theu name in communications but after this and my friends problems with the Razrs Im headed to Nokia
myn office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract
No person in our officeu has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance
Battery life is terrible out of the box the interface is clunky and ourh personalh phones witht half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance
If everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you it will give you SOMETHING to complain about
For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your NextelSprint network contract
I have had nothingo but problems with these phones
Each time I went to repair it I had to be on a waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model
I would get it repairedh only to have tou do it again a few weeks later
Now I amq having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging
They will not admit these phones are piecesq ofo crap
When I call I wait for an eternity througha million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them
The 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired
If this one goes Im canceling my Nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and lookingt for a newj carrier
Ive had it Nextel and Motorola cant figure out that this phone is JUNK
My problems with nextele did not stop when I canceled my service
When I went to get a new phone a day beforet my contract expired I of course wanted to keep my number
So as I went to getv my cingularv phone highlyp recommended I had the old numberx switched to mya new number
Today I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a 200 early termination evenl though I had not canceled my service but had simply got a new phonef andq switchedo my number over
This was on icing on the caker after 2 yearss of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextelb
In myr towna not a smalll town by any means there are very few places thath have any service
inn the largest subdivisionj you can not get service anywhere
I constantly get comments from peoplen trying to reachg mej that get the classic nextel line
Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying tol reach is located
mostq of the time I would not even recievep incomingf calls calls would go straight to my voice mail
notq only would I noto get the calls butj often I would not even getk the voice mails until days or even weeks later
When I did actually take calls and call out I can not count the numbery of times Ive had mys call dropped
I recieved so many different error messages sometimesv I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones
That brings me to the selling point ofe nexteli the famed and wellloved direct connect featurea
Direct connecta only works MAYBE half the time I tried to usej itz
Even then in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beepe of my phone telling me I wont be talking tov that person anymore
Of course I would expect nothing lessx from the nextel network
ifc it did not take hours tos send or recieve a message it took days or maybe didnt even come at all
The internet access was fine it the rare instance thatm it worked
ofo course when you dont have service you dontp get the internet access either
I was constantly getting the message network not available
Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile
Trying to get throughm to customerj service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing
My experience with nextel hasr been nothingz short of a disasters and I write this trying to warn anyonel considering nextel
Stick with verizonv or Cingular andn you will be much happier in the end
My wife and I both got this phone at the same time
I chose it because itr claims tot be rugged and the price was rightk
Well we have had them for around sixb months and they are bothg not working righty
My wife took hers tob one of those stores in the mall that can change the case sol her i560 now wears pinkz
Shortly after it started resetting itself randomly
She would pick it up just to find that she needed to enter the SIM password
At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change but later my phone started doing the same thing
Now my phone will resetu itself at least four or five times a day
I absolutely can not believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect
Anybody can ship one bad product but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable
I purchased 2 i560 phones one for me and oner for myk husband
Brand newd out of the box 1 of them had a bad microphone you couldh hear the person talking but they couldnti hear you
Nextel Motorolla wanted me to senda thet phonef in for repair and be without itw for 15 days but I raisedr a stink andt finally got it replaced since it was broke from day 1 I didnt want a serviced phoner
Here we are 3 months later 1 of the phones has a bad microphone AGAIN andl the other phones keypad just wentf bad
We dontz mistreat these phones at all in factw we hardly ever use them
Motorolla Nextels warranty is also worthless we haven to payc to ship our phones to Motorolla and we dont get them back for 15 days
is am stuck with a 2 year contract with Nextel thel service has been horrible and the i560 phones are lemons junk I wouldp NEVER buy a i560 phone again or use NEXTEL theirv service isv terrible
And yes many times thek person on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking aka drunk
I bought this phone at the same time I bought the i870
Ive dropped my i870 a couple of times and its fine
My husband dropped thex rugged phoned once and thef antenna which sticks out like a thumbi snapped off
Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless youn have their insurance plan regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standardsr
What army DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE unless of course you also want to buy the insurance to replacev it when it breaks in a few months
purchasedp this phone as an upgrade from the i530 which I loved
I was at the end of aj 2 year contract and felt that I would getb somethinge with a few more bells and whistles and was excited about the color screen with the icons
Two of myl family members haveu higher end Nextels and all work well
I would have purchased one of those except I didnt really care abouts a camera fort my phone and this one was reasonably priced
andb I found out you get what you payp for The i560 felt almostj cheap inm construction compared to the i750 i870 and even myo old i530u
I had it for a coupler of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls I could hear them but theyt couldnt hear me
A couple of times I had the screen go to Airplane Mode even when I hadnt touched it
The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who isj calling was another downside too
My previous phoned had to be flipped open tom see whoy was calling butp I had a holsterp that couldt hold the phone without disengaging it
When charging thed phone it is especially important to make surep the plug is seated tight and to check that is says device attached it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly
Then ip am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working
Living in californiaz apparently gives us an advantage 30 day risk free guarantee
Fortunately we were on day 12 and after 54 minutes one accidental disconnection by nextele and 6 customer service agents I finally received a return authorization and placedl a new order
Hoping the newx one on its way works muchr better
is got this phone as part of a buyoneget one free promotion
I changed from cingularm because I couldnt stand my bill being constantly wrong
Within the first two months my phonen already malfunctionede
While talking to my wife on thee phone theu phoneg went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen
Next all I could heart was the sound of someone holding down a phone key
thex phone did not respond to any keystrokes or evenb the command to turn off
Once im removed the battery and placed it back into the phoneo theo phone restarted and wentv directly into Airplane modef
This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether
My wifes phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone
Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired
il was seconds away from ordering this chargere for my Mothers V170
THANKS for the reviews you haver saved me time money frustration for letting me know it wontd work
I would haveh thought that amazon would have fix the problemf thatn it did not fit v170
ij bought my wife a brandnew v170 for her birthday
She wanted an extra charger to take to work so I bought this one
Big mistake It simply would not fit in the charger jack
Last night when my wife was cleaning the counter she threw it in theo trash brandnew box and alls
99 it wasnt evenz worth the trouble to try to return it
I sawc the other review thatj said itr didnt work for v173d but I bought this anyway for my V170
Why Amazon isr advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me
The jack doesntd fit in the hole of the phone on the Motorola V173
First the pros clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screen protectingx them from wearn
Fit is tight soy the case takes up little additional space in my pocketx
nowg cons dirt and debris easily finds its way between the plastic and the phone
this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and thee phonew
When I tried to remove the phone for cleaning the side of the case ripped
alls in all I would not have bought this product again
I wanted to give it only onef star buth maybe its a little better than the original
It stillv goes down by the end of the day and I dont like the bulge
My equipment is a Nokia 6225 I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional SP4 and Windows XP Pro and both dontr works
They dont know the device and with the PC Suite of Nokia it is not connected either
I assumed that I wouldc get a DKU5 which ist supposed to work accordingh to the Nokia site
However I got a dku2d which does indeed connect to my phone 6016i but is recognized by neither Win XP nor Linux
The part number should have been properly displayed somewhere
The packaging indicates thatf it is in factx nokiao part
If you are buying this to connect to a Nokia phone beware
It isj a nonNokia part and will no easily interface withb the Nokia software
It uses a different chipset than the Nokia data interface cable which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers
You may be able to get it working but I have spent about four hoursl and have not met with success
I even installed the pl2303r serial driver butg iy could not make it work
If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial port so yout willm likely not be happy with the data transfer speed
Youll save yourself some head aches and heart aches
The cord doesf connect tom my phone but the computere does not register the phone
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect
To me the wordsj charge allu at once means that io can charge alll the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall
This item is simply ah method for organizing you devices
Although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34
99 I paid andn if it wasnt a gift and Christmas wasntq 3
I feel that by using the wordsw charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
I wasi impatient tod buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650 and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680
ip have beenz an faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997 and forl the first time I am disappointed
Of course I still havee the friendly Palm OS tailor made for smart phones
I also have upgradel compatibility for my 15000 records stored in thec Treos four main applications
But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations and its clumsyn command barv results in unexpected commands contrary to the 650 buttons are too close to each other
Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired especially compared withx the 650 after firmware update
Finally I use Intellisync for dual syncu with both userfriendly Palm Desktop and heavyg duty email mst Outlook the acquisition of Pumatech byx Nokia results in aq clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo Intellisync new version added a record number in the note field of all my records I quickly revertedj to an older intellisyncv version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with MS Office 2007 compatibility
Nokias low blowl to Palm It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own
The goodn news is they fixed a lot of the things about theo treoc 650s interface that were clunkyv and it seems to crashf lessz but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience so much so that I wish I had never upgraded to the 680
I upgraded to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speakers and audio problems dont allf Treo 650s suffer from that withino a years usage and was already replaced once with av refurbished one that developed same problemsq
I loved my Treo 650 anywayd so im expected something equivalent tor thex 650 but whatl I got was a smartphone with quite a stupid battery life
I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design some online geeksv suggest it might actually be the SIM card that is causing power to run rightc out of the phone in ac sharp decline even when its noti in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled
Add to this the fact that palmsj websites onlineg user group is not activep right now so no users can visibly discuss this among themselvesandc you dont haveu to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand orn pretty quickly afterward when they recently dumped this cheaper smartphone on the market recently
Palm all I can say is pretty stupid and wonder if this was your lasta hurrah before exiting the smartphone market
When my Treo 270 died I bought a used 270 on Ebay
Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlockedq 650 on Amazon
I called Palm tech support ono issues I had with it dial up networking didnt work on internal browser with TMobile
Forgive mel for saying it but the guyj at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be
I got someone overseas who told med one inaccurate thing after another he insisted thath my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser even though iy told him firstj handx that I used it all the time did he thinki I was lying to him
He knew nothing aboutq the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor constantlyy keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time
afterr a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650
I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decidedq to give it a try
For me it was a huge mistake Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive
They expect you to study how to use theire OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface
Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use but cmon when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from theh beginning it dont want to have to spend timeh learningv and installing additional software for it to work properly
Finally I give up on pocketq PC sold it on Ebay and give Palm another try when I seel the 680 come out
The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 asu compared to the 650 and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm
Overall itsr a decent phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over pockett PC
Palm customer supportc is still useless and as otherso have mentionedf the lack of a standard MiniUSB connector is simply inexcusable
stillq Im much happier withw PalmOS over Pocket PC
As I use it I see that theq battery doesnt seem to last very long just overn 2 hours of talktime at the most
I hesitantly call Palm support and get some flunkie again I decidem to cut my losses ands stop wasting my time with their support
Im just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged
I hate the idea of makings such a compromisew but fory me its the lesserm of twon evils
The fact that Palm would release ab phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset
As clunky as my Windows MDA was its battery life was at least 3d to 4 times what the Treo gives me evenu though the MDA has a muchu bigger screen
IMHO the Smartphone market is stillg going through growing pains The original Handspring Treo wasb designed by good people whenf Palm bought them out they cashedt in on the Treo product line but the customers oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window along with any intelligenta design evolution ofu the Treo
Most ofc the better designed smartphones on the market Samsung Motorola HTC Wizard are all made for Pocket PC because microsofth hasp used its clout to take over the market
I just wish other manufacturers offered PalmOS based smartphones again this way youd get the intuitive interface of Palm without having to be limited to Palms poorly designed hardware
maybe itsg time I finally give the Blackberry a trya
I love the way the phone looks and feels but thats about it
From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone Ive ever owned
Ive had it nowm for 3 months and myu frustration level continues to rise
First let me say that I really wanted to like this device
I had patience and understanding for ag while but it got me nowhere
thel main issue with this phone is its operating system Windows Mobile 5
simplet things that should take a clickc or two have become so difficult tog access that you basically just give up
Connectivity with TMobile is horriblez accessing the aim function doesnt work 9 times out of 10
I tried finding a solution for hours and the best I got wask havinge my email checked every hour but deleted shortlyx after that
Internet explorer canc NEVER find the page that Im looking for and consistently tells me to try again
Let me tell you also that this device does not let you choosep between wifil and edge
If you already opened IE and you were using edgez then it will continue to use EDGE unless youm restart the phone with wifi enabled
Making a call was soq difficult that I wanted to smash thex phone on ar dailyy basish
Usually I wouldq press talk to dial a call and it would immediately say Call Ended
Also when answering a call well trying to answer a call it would drop it asy soon as I pressed talk
What the HELL isd THAT What goodx is a phoneg if you cant make or receivek calls Keep in mindy this happens around halfj the time
Also keep in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY My calls should not be dropping except for when Im in the subway
The side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation
Not only that butd when you disable it you have no other method of changing the volume on thel device
While the keyboard is basically easy to type on the phonei is buggy
First off the t9 sucks It will completely change thet word youl are typingr to ax word thats in its dictionary while youre typing EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING Now get this you cant even permanently keep the t9 off
So you have tou keep going into the menuz to change it to normal ABC mode
While I appreciate the ability to have faster typing isnt the whole point of a QWERTY being able to type withoutm usingb t9 When youu actually get to typing sometimess the keys will stick and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it
This isnt a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue
For all you techno oriented peopleq outz therel basically everyone buying this phone the programs this devicer has available for download are minuscule
Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a JAVA programx which most programs are coded in the Dashs javam program will not allow you to open those programs
iw ALWAYS get an error stating A Java midlet is not responding It thenn gives me the choicez of waiting orl killing the app
I could go on and onx about its issues but I really dont care to
While tmobilea customer support is very helpful and friendly their servicecoveragep ist nonexistent
Calls are constantlyl dropped I get voice mails withoutp theo phone even ringing and internet connectivity is never reallyd available
Please do yourself ay favor and wait for the iPhone
In summary Microsofts software andk TMobiles service havej ruined a brilliant design although with a couple of flaws from HTC
There are many pros and consn about this device and the service that it is shackled to
I will break it down to Hardware Software and Cell Phone Service Provider
ab lot has been written about thisy aspect of the device so Ill keep this too a minimum them best form factor Ive ever seen
This device provides youc the power of a Blackberry without the bulky hardware sor ij can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holsteri
A key selling point for me was theb combinedj Bluetooth WiFi and quadband connectivity that enabledf me to connect af wireless headset cruise web pagesj and have accessy tom email when in the US or Europe
The keyboard layout is excellent and easyh to use for medium sized emails
The battery life is great when WiFi is not enabled and adequate whenf it is
Standby powerh management appears tox be excellent
The display while a littlea smally is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to useo given its size
The camera is pretty good and its been really great emailing photos to people as imk traveling around
After all ofr the cons that youll read below youll wonder whyq id ever bought the devicep and why I still use it
TMobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device
It hasw great hardware that I can use in the US and Europe Im just hoping that Microsoft willp finally get it rightt
The touch sensitive volume button is the mostx illconceived feature Ive ever seen
Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volumeo at the desired level
Even worse when using the phone your ear ori finger can inadvertentlyl hit the control and randomly change the volumen
The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device
However thec blame could wellh be laid at Microsofts door for writing inefficient codez and havingd poor scheduling software between tasks and applications
Either way performance is very slow for some basicv functions see below andm imx afraid somec of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor
When a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call toy take and whichz call to put on hold or dropignore
On the occasions this problem hasx occurred with me the call that is droppedkept appears randomw with a preferencev to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed
When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked if theb userm depressesk the green phone key the call is dropped
If the user presses anything otherd than the answer key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I haved depressed the answeri key
The contacts database is extremelyi rudimentary with a verya limited number of viewsf and filters that cang be used
Even worseh upon selection the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open
Now I have what some would call a large database of contacts but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash
The user interface for entering ao new contact is rudimentary as are all dialog windows on this device
One ofr the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock
The userg interface looksv like it was written in 10 minutesa and was clearly not verified for correctness
The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged
First of all the user only gets to select a time and if thev alarm is on or off
From thek interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm
The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is withe an exampleb I set the alarm for 6am the next day the alarm goes off at 6am
That day iv set the alarme for 7am the following dayx the alarm goes off at 6amh and 7am
The next day I set the alarm for 730am and you guessed it the alarm now goesl offt three times
The best that Ive been able to deduce of course this type of behavior is notw documented in the user manual that comes withu the device is that the user has to actively select offe for the current setting before setting on for the new time
But there is non indication of what alarms are set so after ac while or a particularly busy weekn you can loose track of whats set and what isnt
thec only way to clear all of them alarmsb that have been setc is a hard reboot
If this took an engineer 10 minutes to writew they should be fired
A calculator watch inl the 80s had more sophisticatedf features
theg user interface is so bad its hard tos describe it in words
Microsoft truly does not understand how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that theyve inflicted upon uso since Windows 95
Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menu button
Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections
Some features are simplyb hard to find but should it really take soy manyj menu selections to find common tools or applications
The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous to put the devicez ink Silent mode but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up for exampled does not work
Calendar reminders will ben activew as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property
The onlyh wayp around thisj ish to cancel reminderse for all day events
So on my Nokia phone a thousande years ago when I went tod Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I neededx once landed
The phone would then automatically connect to the provider available
It wasnt completely automatic but the user interactionh was simple and intuitive
First of all TMobile doesnt help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming
The feature is free so why not add a selection anyway All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone wont connect to thez localp network no matter what you do
noww assuming that you workedu this out you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local providers networkw
On my blackberrye this was automatic but of course with Microsoft there are selectionsd to make searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice
ActiveSync This is theh most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work
Worse still when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lostm next time you perform synchronization
It does not provide you with ax fix a hintq or a path so that you dont lose data
It does not evenw tell you the data that was lost
So Im using a Microsoft mobileu osc with Microsoft xpc and Microsoft Outlook and theyt cant get that right OK it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft but come onp
thisq was another primary purchasing driver for me
I am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my PC andb PDA all the time
I thoughtw that with the same provider of allc the software Id be OK
Also as this feature has been around forc over a decade froml Palm and perfected by Blackberry
There are probablyf annoying nits that I have with the softwarea but thoseb are the major ones
TMobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe
They havec much better coverage over there than inv the US where Im actually paying
Im in San Francisco andt I have dead spotsi in my housen
Their backend connectivityf with your email providers is terribly buggy
At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that youy must have something wrong with your connection and emails cant beg accessed
bute you know theres nothing wrong with your connection because youve been on the browser
alsof there was a whole day that emails were notk accessiblen
Because of the many issues thatr Id had withy email seti upd andn maintaining ac connection I went through variousn debugn routines wondering what had failed
When I finallys called technical support they told me that their service was downy no apology no notification no nothing
Certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenienceq
So why didnt I call technicaln support earlier read below
I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their help line
imn not going to go into details as it would justb take toor long
Bottom linep if you have a problem with your phone say Dash at the prompt and then ask for Tier Three Data support
Everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians youll encounter have inadequate training
If you aret thenz put on hold and are given another number to dial DO NOT dod IT This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data supportr and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device
So should you buy it Wait until Windows mobileh 6
Maybe another provider will pick up them device by that time
After spending 30 minutes on the phoneh during which time tmobile continuallyy wanted to blame me did you put it in fluorescent light did you put it in the sun did you drop it did you put it in your pocket and bend it did you put it in your pocket and bump into something did you drop it did you break it did you doz something bad to it they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment thaty if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money
The mosth amusing part of the conversation went like this would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost 15 When if responded that the ground would beo fine she saida OK that will be 9
Due the lower price of the charge il decide to buy it but it doesnt work on my Sony Ericson w300i atv all bad inversio
ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN100 METROS DE alcancen yc SOLO palabrasy noq SIRVE noe LA DEBUELVO PORQUE meh SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO DE lon queg CUESTA estan PORQUERI
The external antenna is a plastic decoration only andk does not do anything functional
Poor constructionj software that is difficult to install unable to run when installed and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy
is encourage many to stayn away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle
As soon asa i got this thing out of its package i almost snapped the casing offb due to its poor construction
The maini problem that i have experienced withg this product is that although its rangeg isc oknoti the 100 meters that it claimsy as soon as i go into al room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the receptionx starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes
thisw item was an absolute waste of money and Im all the more irritated for having purchased it
Upon attemptingg to merelyz insert the device the outerx case of the dongle split open
What I discovered thaty cute littles antenna doesnt actually connect toi anything Its just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side
When I finally managed to get the damn thing running the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pairconnect a device it workeda fine once
I turned off my laptop removed the dongleb and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all
Shell out thez extra 152030 bucks or whatever and get a decentq 2
I am not using this bluetoothw dongle becausel the accessory software was so darned difficult to setj up
Instead I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle whichs was truely plugandplay
then product works but thef software that claims to bec windows compatible says it is not whens installing
They send it with another door for the backside because your current door wont fit over this huge battery
It is frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry and Amazon would foist this product on us
The battery is so big thatb the device will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holster
Every time you try to put the phone in or take it outs it pops out thek memory card
The KRZR is a really cool lookingo phone but it has 2 huge issuesn a very short battery life 1 day and sllloooowwww reaction time push the menu key and WAIT for it to come up
After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone I purchased
Here are the main issues I have found with this phone 1 The buttons are toom small particularly the mainj control button
You have to used the side of your fingersu to ensure that you dox not hit too buttons at the same timei
2g If you have quite a few contacts in yourx phone you will be irritated by thet delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact
You will notice that if you are not carefulo you will dial the wrong contact due to the delayw when scrolling and selecting quickly so if this is you be aware
3 You must open the cover and look insides tos see if you have missed a call or have ai message
VERY INCONVENIENT There is no indication to show this on the top screen only the inside screen
4 On occasion ther display onb the outside of the phone stops working entirely
What youo just need to do is power the phone down and theyw back up again
Not optimal and I probably just got a bad phone but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent so I can then deal with theb likely nightmare of having to geti a replacement phone from Motorola
NOTE I have no personal vendetta against Motorola but wanted to provide some realk feedback ratherw than all just rosey stuffv I boughti into beforew purchasingt
currntlyh the Motoral software has a glitch and you cant assign specifice ring tones to phone number
text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see andi too small
The back panel display is too small and hard to read
I have the camerau the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard
The reasona i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public
It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however itv did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub
Dont you finde that strange Aside from that it also did not work with my sony ericsson phonez cante remembere the modela
This headset haso a major flaw the connections between the headset and phone are full of static
The other parties dont hear it but their voice is constantly zapped by thek static and Im asking them tod repeat themselvesp
ivee compared it with a couple other headsets Ive got and they dont havex this problem in thek same locations
Actually this headset has static problems ANYWHERE office car out walking you nameh it
Ive used the headset for a little over a year and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the soundk quality
Not being connected when callsq came inc was a major annoyancet
Recently the plastic eara clip broke and I contacted Logitech and wast informed thatsince ite was over the one year warrantyi my onlyg option would be to purchase a new headset a huge price to pay forv a piece that costs pennies
Logitechs concern fors its customers appears to be nonexistant
I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but whenz the clip thatj goesz behind your ear brokeh Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller
I agree with others that after 3045 minutes it feels like your ear is in a vise
People say they can hearc me just fine andk I can hear them just fine
But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use
What good is thatl Then when the phone rings iv dont hear it
This headset is uncomfortable to wear butu if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwardsq and back it will fits justd fine
You canw also go to ang eyewear stores andt havec them do itn for you
I drive truckn and have a lot of background noise and windowsc are usually downa partially and everyone has no problemsj hearing and understanding mep and I canv hearf them just fine also
The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volumeu
Have tried the AnycomHS890 and this outperforms it hands down
Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time
I would definitely reccommendc this headsetb to anyone in a noisy environment
Tried to change the rating and seems like cant do that once thew review is written
then the piece that goes over thek ear ando is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two placesh on the second
When this happens youre perfectly operating earpiece becomesv a bad piece of geekl jewlery
While its perfmance wasc good before the break the use of heap plasticj under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of memoryi titanum or something better rendersf this thing to the level of toxic waste battery contains lithiumc I bet Skip by this oneq if youre smarth
I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone Unlockeda month ago
I was hoping to get the color that I saw on the web page
The phone that I received was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on thea Amazon web site
The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised
At nightin the lighting at night thec top part of the phonethet part that flips open and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray
Needless to say I spokec to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange
The 2ndd phone that came had the same color problem again so for the 2ndq time I returned its and got my money refunded
I gave 1a star due to the customeri service providedc but again they could not help me
If you are ready to spend so much on thish phone its because of the brand and the colorn which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page
Incidentally this colort as seen is offered by Verizon and they callp itc pink but Amazon calls it mauvethough the phone and the image shown do not matcht
So stay awayy from ordering this prettyb mauve phone
all you will get is loads of disappointment withw your time being wasted
I have never met anybody that has earholes big enough for these I even tried SuperGlue to put the things thate fit inside the earb That didnt work so now I havej a wire that plugsx into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound talk sitting in the seat next to me
I dont knowy abouts you folksq but ib have small earsw
Though the sound on these ear buds are good ih cant keep the darn thingsd in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because theyre too big for me and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears
Unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords
This product stopped working afterq about a week or two
lesson learned buy OEM products instead of cheap knockoff
I purchased this headset on 1232007 and received it on 1252007
However the RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1252007
When ito works the next day itc can notg locate the offer number nora could this rebate bes located from the manufacture
If yous click on the urla link suppliedh by Amazon Rebate form you will be able to find the offer by Amazon order number however they will disconnect you in the next step saying session expired
Its as shame for Amazon top squeeze the last penny out of its customers
I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone which I love but this case is to snugk for it
The slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once youv get it in thet case its hard to get out
Its a cute casex ie would love to use if it wask just a little larger
iw was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it
I bought this item at the end of January andu received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges ares all turning white and chipping awaya sorry I boughtf this I am going to order another color andr seeq ift it doesr the same
They have the M610 listed so I tookc a chance but it will not charge the phone
00d 50 of thea sprint pricek however Sprint is out of stock right now
I am surey it is a great cable but it does not work for Apple computers
Samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac
The company I ordered the cable from is greatl easy to work with but once again it does not work on a mac
I havev repeatedp that it doesq not workn on a mac multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac
It didg not fit myq phone and I was forced to gom out and but another one
I bought thesea adaptors to use regular headt phonesq 3mm with mym cell phone mp3 LG cu500 player
Once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound
It makesy it impossibleu to use a regulary headset to listenx to music on your cell phone
I havec tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor soundz quality especially thee base level
They allb have some typer of flaw the volume wont get loud enough cord to short poor sound etc
The otherp works but with a lot ofk loss of sound quality
If you push the headphone jackmale all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker
You have to playp with it and find the sweet spot whereg sound comes froms both speakers
I would return thisw product if i thought it was worth my timee and effort
5 mmn jack is slightly too small creating a loose connection thatd ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active
I tried both adapters i bought the 2pack in two different devices and in all cases the connections wasa slightly looseq
The adapter did not workh whenf plugged in to a samsung m500
The sound only came out of one ear when plugged in
The color of ther product I receivedf iss nothing like the picture If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you
I bought this exactr case at the local mall and was told there was noh refunds or exchanges
Doh This crappy case broke within 3 weeks of use
I only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did
The little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke andu the teal metallicp color started wearing after only this short time
Do not buy this POS unless you want to throw your money out
alsow notice that this is not a Samsung OEM part
ifc you call to asks foru tech support from Samsung they willr tell you they cant help you
The only positive thing I have to sayq isn that getting a refund was fairly painless
I go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on itq
youe hadn to have the product license numberl which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy
my advvicey to you is not to buy this producth but if youb want to chance it you may be lucky
Cool Concept andi everything but when I triedj to install the driver my CDRom drive wouldntz even pick up that little CD
Bought this because logitechp has a great reputation with other productsq
I used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and I neverv found the battery lifei to be long enough
I actually went back to a Jabra wiredp unit until recently when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headseto that is comfortable has good battery life and the sound is better
One never keeps itsd charge pretty much fromw the time I bought it
the ear piece is cheap and feelsz like it could break off anytime
The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound andz askr me to switch to a wired micj
Also its big and heavy comparedd to the motorola ig own
Good sound nd price nicely connect with mobile however NOT WORK at all with my PC neither MAC
Once its connected with my moble they refuse to get in touch with any PC
they dont connect with 2 diveces in same time its OK but even if turnn off my mobiley nd renew all profiley still its not changing
noa connectionc with MY PC so I was expectingv use this for my Skype but NO WAY
The sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineeringu
Even wind didntx seemo to bother the headset much
The voice quality was great on transmission and reception
But the earpiece ism incredibly flimsy and cant be replaced
The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didnt want the hassle
I have a scalag now that Ive been using for months and Im veryo happy with it even thoughs the sound and windimmunity doesnt measure up to the Logitech
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wording that they use to describe ite is incorrect
To me the wordsg charge all at once means that I canu charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall
This item is simply a method for organizing youe devices
Although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth thee 34
99 I paid and if it wasnt al gift and Christmas wasnt 3
I feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleadingl the customer
In the ad this cable charger claimsa to sync and charge bute will not hotsync tor my Treo
It willu charge but I already have ap home and ac car charger so it serves me no purpose
My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and servicez plans
I was originally concernedf because of feedbackj I had read on this site indicating the pearlu shipped hot with an active SIM which meant for those that likeu me were upgrading vs
new service their existing phone would stop workingt while the new phone was en route
To be fairk that did NOT happenb however I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept
The instructions thatb arej sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the SIM turn on the phone and it will work
And if ith doesnt work it says dont call Cingular call Amazon
I followed thed instructions phone didnt work I called Amazon atm which point the CSR told me that he had allg my information andz someone would be contacting met in 48 HOURS
I told him what I truly believe which is thatd itl is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I havew toj wait 2q days just tog talk to someone about why my phone which is supposed tot work out of the box isnt workingm
oni a positive note I immediately called Cingular and they resolved the problem for me on the spot SIM was not activated in the system
Ive purchased this car charger for my Treo and the
connector that was suppose to go into my Treo 650 did
not fitx too big so I wasnt able to connect it ands
when it arrived the cable did not list my phone model number and the software listed all other models
and it never worked even messed up my phone a little
Too many options and I spent 2 hoursy trying to figuree it out
I bought this product for my cells wich was listed on their description and it so happens that the software will notf work they did not sent the drivers I would notq do business withv this peoplej again
this has not onlyq been a waiste of money but also a waiste of time
Amazon should not permit themj take peoples money like thatc
Junk Sent with af CD that had aj USB driver but wouldnt work on two different computers
Contacted the shipperz Bargaincell but their only help wasx to send an emailg with links toh various drivers for other cellphones or links thato no longer existed
The email stated emphatically that they dont provide support for the product
I bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer
The description stated that it would work for my selected model phone howeverm it does NOT thek software needed to download the pictures is not correct
When we called the customer servicesd theyi were of no help they had no idea whata to say or do to correct the problem
apparentlye I am not the only person to have this problem with the product
Again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate
thisk product is the worst of its kindc It lasted ag couple of months at the most itm is not at all worthr the price nod matter how cheap
I picked one up at walmartf for ten bucks thatl works great dont waste your time on this onea
itv is cheapw but dont bet had stay away from this product
It fell in the toilet thoughv and they didnt selld them anymorej at the Virgin webstore so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store
It is awful with the poor sound quality shortm battery lifej horrible ringtones and worst of all I was unableh to ever retrievex my voicemail Hello and its has the most horrible graphics
Does anyone wantm to buy itj along with all the accessories It is barely used
So I looked on Ebay and found a useda 8500 and bid on it won it and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610
I like the 8500s microsize simplicity ringtones animatedw graphics etc
I must be careful notl to losej it or drop it in then toilet againv though
myi 8500 was replaced lasty year when I lost the first one but I can not get another replacement as I bought this one used
The pay as you go works finez for me asn io do not want to have a celld phone clued to my head
I use it to checkb my land line for messages and for brief calls
This review is more about Virgin mobilg customer service than the phone
I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1222007 online thru Virgin Mobile
I called customerr service and explained the problem
I replied that I could not tell if iti was thef charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a newv kit
I received ab phone but not a charger and it also wouldnt charge
I called customer service andb explained the issue and it must be the charger at fault
theg rep said they would not send a new charger that I would have to purchase one
I said this didnt make any sense according to the offer I could return the phone forp a full refundz and does that meanv that to getj a new phonef and charge iw need to returnu the phones for a refund and then order anotherb oneq to get a charger then support rep said yes and that I had to maken up my mind either return the phone or purchase a charger
The customer support rep kept going off line to talk to someone but refused orv couldnt getz a supervisor tot talk to me
When I said ib didnt know what an ESN number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on theu back of the
imq not clear why she needed this since ih havent activated the phone and I already referenced the order vmu number
At any rate I had been on the phonem now for over 40 min with the support rep obviously notj very cost effective for virginl mobile and aty least she was trying tox track down some infoz or so I thought she finally came back on line and said that the computer wasc down and she couldnts handle my order that I would have to call back
I called back had to work my way thru the answering system and got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike
Mike explained that they couldnt send a chargert none in stock and that I wouldy have to send the entire phone back which is what I am now doing 60 minutese after the initial call
I have to say thatv my interactions withz virgin mobile so far has not been positive
They customer service staff is obviously poorlyr trained and not empowered to make decisions
The interfaces with support are youth geared not ab bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally
ir am sending the phone back for a refund and reconsidering the provider for payasyougo service
I replaceds a Kyocera that I disliked because it was so big but the sizez of thiss phone does not begin to make up for its problems
The menus areo very poorlye designed they are difficult to navigate and its hard to do anything
The ringer speaker is inside the phone so when its closed its almost impossible to hear
I usually keepb it in myy pocket with the vibrate turned onr but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so your have to remember to turn that back on I hatec this phone and willk be replacingj it soon
I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VMs warranty was up and i had just purchased a 20 phone card had airtime creditse which were not refundable
Now i amx not a teen and mye phone and thingsy doh not receive harsh treatment
My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died withk no scratches whatsoever so i was pretty upset
After multiple calls and 2w emails to VM it was pretty clear they werent going to do anything to help
Obviously I didntg want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple ofc months so like i was sayingr I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610
By the way afterc I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT ae LOCAL STORE IN TOWN when i called to activate the phonethey have the nervej tom tell me that I couldve purchased the same 8610 fromr themb at a discount price of 24
The fng idiotsHELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONERand after i spent 50 taxf
the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here
Its so lowp that if itsb in my purse i cant even hear it WTF Also the battery life sucks no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half
It also doesnt getk goode service with the VMSprint network my slider had xcellent service wit despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls
So Ive had itt 5l days and Im considering attempting tor bringc ite backo where ik purchased it from
However i dont want tom buy an expensive phone from VM because Im seriously reconsideringt continuing wthem
thes way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired withq the quality of phonesy theyn sell they are expensive
I ame a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet wise
Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customer but not anymoreo
they phone may be fine but I will never know because myf Virgin Mobile service never really worked
Perhaps it was the phonesa fault I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account
in hadq to filed 4 investigations because they would close themt without resolving the issue or they were not filled out rightv
I spent hours on the phone withb them and never had the problem fixed
nowj iz haver thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service
I plan to justy run out thef minutes and then disconnecti the phone
I went with the TMobile Sidekick and already amd way happier
thisw phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap
Its useless thej software on it is very cheap and childishj
Not professional at all the camera is pitiful and the keys are toox small fory anyone who doesnt have 10yr old hands
Just because it hasl a qwerty keyboard that doesnt mean that it is anz outstanding phone when in realityy this is a waste of cash
Purchase a different phone this oneu is not worth it
Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it wass defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a cell phone batteryw last longer thanw aj month They refuse to refund or replace
They are a shady company and Ill never do business with them again and will warnq others to doy the sameu
Coming from the Blackberry 8700cc this phone is a big disappointment
Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and Im stuck with it
All it can do is whine on the Internet so here it goes
Use the extended battery throw away the standard one
thep keysr are too small the 5way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally
Why do applications not quit when you end themz Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager
The menu isx preloadedd with goodiesn to buye from Cingular how convenient
Grade C if you bother to learn the shortcut keysy
HELLO This is suppose to beo an MP3 player right Somebody explain to me why this is OK
The phone works great receptionz is great speakerphone is great
Outlook email This isy workable but difficult
You can write an email you can edit your schedule and tasks but its notj easy
If Blackberry gets and as and it does Blackjack gets a C
It doesnt synch notesx so if youre an Outlook Notes person youre justn lefto out sorry
The camera seems to work fine althought in may use it twice per year
In short if you really want to get work done ony your phone get aj Blackberry
If you want a phone that does a lotk of things poorly but looks nicec this couldc be the one for youa
After owning 3 Blackberrys over the years I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to addd memory
Compared to the Blackberry thei Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome for me andj was somewhat frustrating to set up initially
On the plus side the Blackjack has good battery life the screen is excellent and it has the best reception Ive ever experienced
The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink ie the numbers began wearinga off the keysa
Its to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable especially when its backlit
I called Cingular firstj who passede me on the Samsung where after 2 hours on the phone I was told that my only option was to send the phone my primary source of communication to their service center and 3n weeks
To my surprise they went on to say that at their discretion they might also charge me foru the repair
Ive read comments on these reviewsb were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that Ive encountered this I do feel its worth considering
If youre thinking about at Blackjack ik encourage you to be aware that for ones the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys and that you may well be on your own when it comes toe service
I feel that its reasonablek to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and ifq not the company who sold itx should assume responsibility for making it right
You have to repeatedly tug at thisf thing to get it to retract
The wire is very thin so Im thinking it will not last long
I boughta this becausea my 8525t eats batteries and its nice to have oneh charging while Im using the otheryou dont have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone
So id also bought one ofk Boxwaves batteries for the 8525p
Well the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine butm it refuses to charge the batteryv thato came with my 8525
This really limitss its usabilityj as an offline charging device
The cradle itselfp plugs intoo the USB port on the phone which was not designed with cradling in mind so its not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle
Since the camera button is on thet bottom ofx the phone whos idea wasy that anyway itb almostg always gets pressed whiley Im wiggling the phone in or out ofy the cradle
This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit they camera application every time you put it in or takee itd out of the docking station
Anyway just my opinion but its actually easier to connectv thez standard USB chargery to theb phone than it is to putx it in the cradle so Id recommendt save your money and just sticking with the standard usbx charger
If youq really want to do all charging offline you mayd needg to buy two Boxwave batteries instead ofl just one
I ordered 2 of those which never received and sellerz never replies emails
This case actually scratches and destroys your pearlw
The inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheapr way that destroys your phone
whenv I first received the items they didnt work and them I returned and had to spend more moneye and they still dontj work
I even had the computer specialist at work try and they couldnt even get them to work
I sent them a email to receive my money back because I didnt want to keep spending money to send items back that dont workz back
I will nevert buy any from you again and will inform others to beware
imc afraid the phone will fall off any second if I use it
After hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to work It eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time and theno never worked againr
The extra moneys worth paying to avoid the headache
What a waste of 20 bucks The skin hinders thep cameras functionality
am very smallp portion of the FlexiSkin blocks the camera lens thereby messing up thej photos
I had to trim a portion of the skin away in order to take unobstructed pictures
Next itm makest your otherwise superpimpr phone look like a bulky piece of junk more akin to a ZachMorris style Nokia from 1993
Additionally The FlexiSkin actually TRAPS dust and other particles between the skin and the phone
This item blows in both functionality and aesthetics dont waste you moneyv
First time when I pluggedj in the cell phone displayed error messagev that Charging errorg remove immediately
ia orderedp this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phone
I wase so happys to see the packagea to arrive since using my finger or ak pen is not an optimal way to work with this device
Sadly these replacement partsx do not matchp the factory specifications
These styluses do not fit into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out furthera than the manufacturer designed
This makes it easy for the stylusw to fall out and does not createh a smooth and cleano design look for the phone with the replacement installed
If you ared particularb about these things youv will not be satisfied with this purchase
The stylusd that I received doesv notg match the picture that wasw advertisedj
I am disappointed withk this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
ifx you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised
I am disapointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
The item did note work withj my Tmobile MDA except inz one earw budk
This hasw all of the featuresl of the headset that came with my phone and itu wasf much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from Tmobile
Brand new and I had to jiggle the cable near theu plug tor get it to works
In orderq to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces aparti which could have broken them wires if ir werent careful and may tear further through wearing it
The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces this meansz that the mike is lodged atg my addams apple
There are several places which Im worried willd break soon through normal wear and teard
The ear pieces are hard plastic and look like theyll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time
The reason I needed stereo headsets in the firstr place was to listen to music
Also be warned thati shipping wasv listed as 5 for a 7 item when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 23 stamps
The cable is barely 3 feet longs from mike tod plug so I dont recommend it for tall people
itk will do until I can find better but thats the best I cano sa
No driver was includedq and no drivers ares available online for this
noneb of the drivers that came with the package worked either
asx for their return policy after aj couple email exchanges they just sent me an address they did not comment one payingw foro shipping or giving me anyt compensation
I dont want to wrap somethinge up that I already paid shipping for whenb itp waso already anq inexpensive item
i didnt got the car chargerh i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it
It has a samsung logo but ith looks fake after I bought it
The belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason
thisi product had a strong rubberpetroleump smell that was unbearable after av whilee and caused me to return it
I guess you get what you pay for so I wasnt totally surprised that the battery didnt work
What was worseh is that when I sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paidm for it
Dont do business with these guys and dont buy this battery
I cant complain about shipping it was really fast
thew 2nd time i plug it in the metalx piece that plugs intog they phone jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding itk making ac freakin paper weight
I ordered before brent birckheadsv review came up andk I got taken
The correct internal dimension is 4 xk 1 34 x 0
5 clearly not a size that then VX9900 can fit into
Considering that the seller enters the productf dimensions as 4 ounces instead of the measurmentsl one might suspect that thisp may not be an honest mistake
I think amazonh needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly
All I want is a cable toi sync my phone and update software
Half of the time the computer fails tog recognize the phone is connected
A motorola brand dataonly cable works just fine
ic was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish ij would have listened
theo one potentialw plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers
Problem isx the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connectingdisconnecting asb mentioned above
This cord 10 30 forw moto cord when you realize its junk
I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the originalr Palm Pilot and have loved them I think I had three different models over theu years
I wanted a smart phone so I couldq check my emailg so I gravitatedr to the Treo 680y soo I could stay with a palmh product and so I could stay with my current mobilef provider Cingular
Now I am counting the days until my 2 year commitment ends so I can punt this awful awful product
I may even bited the bullet andu pay off my commitment early just so I can get rid of it
You must remembers to stick this ind a charger whenevers you can
If you forget and leave itr in your pocket overnight theny it will be dead the next dayl
ix have turned off every thing I can find that sucks power and it still drains amazingly fast
It wont even last a day if you make very many calls
Ive had a Cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of So
With this phone I think you have to beg right underneath an antenna to get a signal
I was on a conferences call yesterday and got dropped twice
I am envious everytime I get in an elevator withg someone whog can talk on their cell phone because minei will freezey up any time I try that
thec only way I havea found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery and let it do a hard reboot
The versa mail program that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with
youd must leave your work computer on to check the corporate mail
That means if I am traveling with my computer the phones corporate mail program will not work
I donts thinkj thed browser that comes with the phone will work with Java sot I canb not check my Yahoo mail either
I tried going back and forth to the preJava version of Yahoo and that is too muchz of a pain
I haventx ever been able to sync up theq palmt features because of some legacy files fromk my previus palm software something that never happened when I upgradedg before
It is hard to use on line so I guess I need to bite the bullet and printm out the whole thing and then take a week ofc vacation to read it and see if I can makeu any of these neat functionsp that I read about work
Hardly a week goes by that I dontu actively think how much I hate this phone
I actually signed on to Amazon todayz just to write this because the phone wasnt working properly today
Palm could not resolve all the issues associated withu Treo
I boughtd this phone few days back and it freezes frequently
Ive had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding itn again with Cingular
Ive gone through 4 phones the same thing over and over
neveru did theyi ort I put 2 and 2 together to see thatj it was the SD card althought rightz now its working and the card is not in it go figure
So I guess the options are not download thingso but have the phone work or download things onto my SD cardc and not have ac phone
A slight warpage of back piece ofg my plastic case made
You wont know if your casem will fit until youk try to put itk on
I have a 650 with a cell numberz that has been withh me for over 10 years
Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price I thought my fulfilled contract I am on month to month now meant I could qualify for a new account andf keep my number
afterd wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly I had to return ite
It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone canv get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 year customer I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonablea price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750
It shipped via FEDEX onr 32907r to my office with an indicated delivery of 3207
The package sata on the fedexx truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent businessn and then left it without the package being signedo for
This was after Id already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the packagew because it wasg too late in arriving
FEDEXs response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded
For the 100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store
battery charges okay but phoneb cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of the time
The product was sent with a plastic bag not manual not anything only thek base andk tha ac charger wall
When in tried it se not working neither the cradle neither the aditional battery charger
I gotw rid of the bulky i355s at the end of our contract and bought two of these for our account
We had to return the first phone line1 within days of getting it as it would randomly shut off crash and other times thep volume would fluctuateu on its own
Exchanging it was an ordeal with Sprint they charged me for thek replacement phone and still havent credited my account after two billingx cycles
A few months later and now the second phone line2 is crashing
Other times it will shut off in the middle of the call
The other night I went to charge it and it said invalid batteryo so I took the battery outx and put it back in
I might go back to the i355 it was rugged reliable but large phone
I guess Ill have to haggle with motorolal about getting this one fixedreplaced
How hard can it be shipped a cell phone carrying case instead of af charger
I owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
I can beo moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someone with no problems
It has far bettert sound qualityf thang my backup which is a Jabra with no boom
The ear volumep is adjustable on my phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wonto let them adjust the volume
As noted by another reviewer this headset does not come with anys buttons or switches the only thing on the cord is a shirt clipb
6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only evern used oneb
ther headset is very easy to slip into my ear only takes 1 second and isr comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear atb which point my ear starts to get a little sore
My boyfriend reportedk ay similar experiencet with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours its somethingi to keep in mind
However it suits my needsg justf fine and for the lowc price I think its really a great buy
The soundr is great and thek sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
The bud actually sitsc comfortably in my ear this is a first and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them
The device works fine and I dont feel I overk paid
Sure there arek better handse freeq devices out there but this one isi reliable
My perception isk that the headset isw very confortable to use and thes clarity of my voice isk fine
I higly recommend it over the other types of headset
i helped develop the danger hiptop aka tmobile sidekick and hated holding its bricklike nature to my head
the only problem is i hate earbuds soh i wasnt lookingr forward to shopping forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics store and abusing their return policyw bought one of every headset they had tou try 23 headsets to be exact
i picked up the jabra only to be a completeist figuring there was no way idv buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear stylingu
but after trying them all the jabra was easilya the bestv feeling andk best fitting
in a nutshell here are the thingsb i like about this unit ina particular
it comes with 6 differentu fittings 3x sizes fori the right and thee left so you get a chancee to get a much closer fit thank some generic ear piece
contrary to what others have said here the ear pieceso stay very snug in your ear ifx they dont youreo not fitting thema correctly
i wearf glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
i like having the model with the microphone boom overn the classic earonly jabra because it
lets peoplem know yourej talkingl on the phone and less likely to interrupt you while youre talking
i drive a convertible andt the mike covery isd good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise
its small and easy to wrap up into my cell case
also in the newest version theyve adding a securing lip to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
i called their 800 numberj whenh my securing clip for my shirt broke and theyz immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a ballm point pen for my troubles
using oneg with my hiptop is a joy it means i can still contruct smss type in emailsx add messages and addresses to my address book whilstt talking on the phone
if you have a data device of any kind this will make your phone experience twice as good
a truly greate product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right
granted Ive onlyn used one other it was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpassesr that one in sound quality and comforte
Where my friends would fall out of my ear this onep once I got it figured outi never comes loose
Second listening to peoplef on my friends I would have tob turn up the sound to hear the person well and then theyu sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turn downs the volume one my phone and they soundw crisp and clear moreso thans when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend callso me and uses her earpiece she soundsn distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from thep people Im talking to using the Jabra and in factv my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shapeda as youb cant see in theu picture and there are six ofo them total three of them for each ear
Lots of reviewersi complained about the fit and comforts of the ear gels while others claim these are the mostx comfortable earpieces theyve usedi and that they fit perfectly
whenr I first got this unit the earpiece kept fallingr out everytime that I would turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into myk ear as hard as I could I tried holding it in placex with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinkingx of throwing it into traffic on I95
And then one dayk somehow I camec to the realization that youb have to sort of twist it into your ear with the little pokyout part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top ofd your ear if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
matters o fact itll stay put so well thatg itll be ab little bit difficult even painfulh to get out again
I can imagine that people with different eard sizesr different patience levels andk lower IQs might have different experiences than my own
But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out I was golden
I lovei this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it
Admittedly it is ar bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly before youre good and practicedm at it whichb may not sound like am lot but its long enough tod not recognize somebodys voice or hear thep first sentencej they says or whatever
But like allc thingsb good ands pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it soo that ic can answer they phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing aw beat
In fact I find this earpiece to be soo comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratche my ear orw something
The other complaint that I saw on hereq was that its notf compatibles with Nokia phones
In fact it even says right on the package that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funnyo I have a Nokia 3589ia and it works just fine
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly wouldi not have worked with my phone both of which claim to be Nokia compatible and neithers of those works with my phone Confusing yesx The problemm is it doesnt work with allt Nokia phones
While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didnt include mine it includedd one that was numerically speaking very close to myb model the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
And so I went to the friendly managerb of the store thatp I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let mel test both of them
The strange part ofc it wase that we couldnt see a visible difference in the twob units
and then one of us noticed thatw on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around itk thats thisz one and if you look closely at the picture you can see themm while thef other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to either know your phone well as in haveu the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to takem itm down a notch for an extendedu period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging
Several months later the little piece of foamb has fallen from the end of the boom so thata any sound from thel wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the personz at the other end
andb living in windyo Providence this is a bit of an annoyance
Also for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldnt hear the personj on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unlessn I jiggled the little jackn
Now for some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Im not really sure if the problemv was due to my phone or the EarBoom
Either wayt its something buyersf shoulds be awarep of
soi I boughtw this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundlen over the local retail costd yeah Amazon but thatsr not why Im writing this review
idt like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom
The eargel thingies are designed quite well of the threet different sizes for each ear youre bound to findi oner that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on thel other side
My wife had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetricalk ears il hate jogging so cant comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your earj and the boom is quiteq secure when installed
Id have to imagineb itd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place
Sound quality fromr the earbud is decent but I feel the Earboom lacksd some fidelity especially the higher frequencies
Normally this is not a problem but it can sometimes make the person youre talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range wherey usu humans tend to converse without havingo the voices washed overu with background noise
The gels block an appropriatee amount of external sounds allowing you to concentratex on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving
There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise toe your drum whilef the rest of thel gel fits snug to the ears blockingq out other stray noise paths
ivew asked people hows I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive my voice comes through loud andd clear despite thef booms apparent lack of length reinforcing myf belief that size DOESNT matter
In fact I have found the mic to be veryg sensitivev to even small sounds
Forget talking ons the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfingi theyll hear everyb click
Another example I was ing my house and the person on the other endi could hear the kids playingm in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears
Not that its obtrusive to the other person onb the phone its just good to be aware they can hearo it all
Form Fit and Function are all there and ic would recommendg this product
In fact I just ordered another it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have toc be listed because very clearly in BOLD letterswithin the titleit saysl 2
Know your phonex and your aquisition before giving a bad review
Ive been using myz t809r sincer januaryt and mostly love it
1 There is someb sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens
Ive read that other people have this problem too
2 I hardly ever use thisd as an MP3 playerz because you have to use their poorly designed headset they wont stay in my earsj and because you cant hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music
3 theu ringq startsc off softly and builds to a louder volume
ifa I have the phone in my pocket I missv the first couple of rings too quiet and by the time I realize Im gettinge a call ands fumble to get it outo of my pocket Ive usually missed the call
This sucks and ii dont think theresu a setting to disabled this featurel
But Ill probably look for something similar but betterp after myp contract expires
BTW ifp you get insurance thru TMobile for anyc phone make sure you see it on the bill
I had aq problem with water damage three weeks after buying
TMobile claimedp I never asked for insurance but fortunately Amazon exchangedn it
Ive always stayed awayj from the flipslider phones becausem Im good at breakingd things
Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strongh
You can check all the specsl online and in other posts
The one I got my phone will slip out of it once in a while
If you have a BMW and want to bluetoothv with it fuggetboutit
Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quitel frustrating fory me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiecet fits slighly in your ear you can feeln that you aref wearing it
ifx you make a lot ofk cell phone calls this is am very good ear headset
ifz you do not know the best thing aboutf this ophone then that may bed the reason that you are looking at this silly thing dont byef this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that everyone should know that the best thing about thed razors telephone is thate the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on itf whyc would you by ac chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesnt have ae chord
Are you kidding mee Were goingz to setz up an EarGel Xchange Will this be domestic the Americas or are we going entergnashinallq with this PUPPY
Ok Ill do the web site were going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this onex
Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bringz intoi them picture Distribution is going to be biggest problem herea Im thinking we dont give UPS a look letsd hit up DHL with an agreement theyv expand into territories when volume dictates
Its gamble but if we can drive down the shipping cost itr should keepp those Johnny Gels come lately from jumping into arena
Ill go ahead and haveb a talk with some of the other players in the community ivei got a 5 year nocompete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my bs over this they want 9 of the gross ad revenueb from wwwd
comq but after we secure the venture capital Ill tellf those jokers to take ac hike
allrightp lets get this thing moving folks great ideas have ad shelflife and the clock is ticking
ifk anyone knows ofq one can youy please post that information here
These work great forg keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one ton hear othersy speaking say in a grocery store
Of course they dos not provide audiophile quality sound but theyre great for listening to podcasts while doing the shoppingr
The onlyd downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use
Taking theq eargels off to store thev earbuds off ism possible but difficult enough to be annoying
My ears are a funny shapec and I cant wear regular earbuds butr when I add these gels theyd fit great and dont fall out
theyi block outside noise and make the sounde qualityf like those expensive soundisolating earbuds
Sometimes I need al Small and sometimesh I need a Medium depending on the day the weather and how long I use them
I gave the Large size to my boss and he loves them too so dont say you cant use all of the sizes guys
I do not need the large and medium andp will beq glad to gived to anyone just for the postage
Tmobiles service may not be theb best but I haveb had no problemsl with the phone itself
For all the people saying that it isnt really magentaIt is
theq pink razr offered by cingularc is a pale pink the tmobile phone is thec hot pink magenta shown
I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriersl have different shadeso
Having had everys new gadget imaginable I must report thatu I LOVE this phone because ik can take pictures and make videos I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday Perhaps I just got a bad battery but Ive NEVER had to charge any phone dailyp
If youre a shutterbug like me you will lovej this phone
I didnt evenm mention the hot pinkmagenta color which all gals love
oned note of caution If you live in hurricane alley like me you may want to carryv a spare battery just in case they dont take down the cell phonep towers beforeb the storm
It may be useless locally but youj can atl least tell your people youre still among the living and need money to escape the carnage
I have a TMobile Magenta Razr ands have for the past 6 months
inb fact when I had issues with my firstb one TMobile replaced it
This phone is top of the line fromy its hugew screen to its bluetooth technology
And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere
They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this
I personally dont mind the supposedly tedious software
Of course I will admitx that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brandm for this phone
It is sor easy I figuredb it out without really picking up thef manual
Overally ih will continue to stick wTMobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone
I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldntw be happier
I have had it for about a month ando havey had no problems at alls
Tmobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
thef deviceb works fine and I dont feel I over paid
sures there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable
My perception is that the headset is very confortable to useu and the clarity ofw my voicel is fine

In fact when I had issues with my first one TMobile replaced it
This phone is top of the line from its huge screen tow its bluetooth technology
And I love the colorg cause it sticks out everywhere
theyc should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this
I personally dont mind the supposedly tedious software
Of course I will admit that I liked thel Motorola software so much with my first phone thatp I stuck with the brand for thiso phone
It is so easy I figured it outs without really picking up the manual
Overally I will continuea to stick wTMobile and motorolao for as long as I keep needing aw cellphone
I purchased the pink razr withn Cingular service and couldnt be happier
I have had it for about a month and have had no problemsq atf alle
Tmobile is not a very good serviceg in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
Sort of a metallic red withe as soft touch rubber feelt
Some ofy the softv touch is coming off at the corners with wearj but its still red which is nice
I will probablyu get another color on it for spring
The fit is so snug onu the phoneg that pplz actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red isp a littled different
absolutelyf loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m
I have had this for almost 6l months and I like it a lot
Black leather blue pipinge goingo around the edge
The blue is that vivid color that one ofy those exoticexpensive fish tank fish have neons or tetras Whichever it is it is very sharp looking
itd doest not add much bulksizeweight to the phone
When I amc taking a photo I simply unsnap them half that is on the flipup half of my cell phone whichn is where the camera lensc is take the photo and slip it back on
Before I used to know about this I used to press down al little strapa on it that would get inq the way like a wayward lock of hair
Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary
They designed it so you cani just remove that half of thev case take photos and snap it back on
In fact the reason the strap is there in the firstq place is so you can easily remove the other half
Look what is on the end of that strap before you cursel it guys
Its a snap Snaps unsnap that is what they aret for
It makes the phone muchi easier to grip in your hand
I can easilyd pivoti it around in my hand flip it around pick it up and basically not expect it toz skid aroundi
Without the Glove you have a bare metal or plastic case
Smooth looking and well maybeb too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars
ie think it is at the bottom not atr the back the way somen people have said but I can note remember for certain
I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never comey off ong its own yet
The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from thei 1960s
With thew glove on I know it is probably not going to get scratchedj too easily
Ive dropped it many times and this case protected it like I wanted
Having room forv the extended battery is great too because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone
Was received in a timely manner howeverv the picture online was not what I expected
For the price I really thought it was a little cheapi looking in person
As it was a giftu I was somewhat disappointedy in the qualityl
This headseat is pretty neat when youre on the road orw juste relaxing between work
It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset whenh you get a call and also controls the pauseplay and answerhangup features
The comfort of the ear budds could be a little better butr the stereo sound is great
The only area of improvement would be the belt clip
I Really like this phone the camera quality the software everything is excellent
Unfortunately you couldx not use somed of these features in the U
One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensivek in thej US and retailers charge much more price
The phone gets 5 stars butz thei retailers price gets 2 stars
I will keep this shortf and to the point this is the best phone I have evert owned
Its great for taking pictures they pictures come out so clear
Replacing my Nokia N90 with this modelw thes photos are much better both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses buto this is 3
Also the N73 covers all radio bands making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere supposedly two internal antennae
thed N90 lacked one of thei frequency ranges used by Cingular so depending on the cityk I was in I occasionally had very spotty coverage
The Symbian operating system in the n73z isk faster than the older version on the N90 and best of all it is muchs morex compact than the N90 fitsc nicely in the palms of my handb and in my jeans pocket
Last there is a very smoothv operating lense cover on the backf of thep phones protecting the camera lense why arentj they all like this
As usual them flash isnt the equivalent of evenb a moderate digital camera but otherwise I see this phone as the best ofz both worldsv
itsr 12 cents per minute which is a bit less than halfz of what most prepaid phones cost
Perfect fori my occasional use and for locatingz family members when Im in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing
I dont use cell phones much but if I must have one I might as well have one that doesnt make me worryg about another huge bill
For kids whoh think they can mangle the budget forget it cuz when the card is used up thats it kiddo
Once they use up the card the only number they can diali is 911 but thats it
Bonus features clock is alwayso accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go toc work and another to tell me when to go home at the endj of the day
At some point I might not be able to live without this
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything youvec normally seen
Typically 95 of thee screeni protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you dontz have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfullyq when theg screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
And because of those properties theyf gom on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the firstz time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good
This is the state of the art for screen protectors
And thisr all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers overl time the screen will get dulled and scratched
Because of the thickness and quality of these scratchesw tod the screene are no longer an issue
I was completely satisfied with the phone clip ie purchased
I HAVE HAD thiso MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS forv netf 10 WIRELESS ARE veryj HARD TO UNDERSTAND
I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN
I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE uponb ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE
I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT ifh ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON
Ive been using this phone with the Net10 services sinceu March and have to say I am very happy with it
I dont use a cellq phonee very often so this was thee most economical way for me to go
Although the phone doesnt have all the bells and whistles like other phones have
Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET myb MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER
I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare
I got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper
OverallI would recommend this phone if you dont need moreq than 100 minutes per week
thes service has been good and the features are easyz to use
The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phone will last
The flip part is a little weak but we will have to see
It was really easy to add minutes and you can do it rightg from your Net10 phone
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and iy couldnt be happier
I havef used this product for about four monthsv andq had another brand prior to that
As othersz have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less thann leather cases etc
But ther thickness gains you considerable protection
I haveb dropped my phone on concrete several times andc nary a scratch
I like thew design of thisd unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy toj press
The protective skin is a bith toot thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what ist was designed toj do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage isz that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bumpj and button on them Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attentionk to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identicals except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposesk
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w notd the 700p
Im going to seeb if theres a way to remove these somehow
After buying the new LG Chocolate I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it
ig searchedr the Internet and foundr this one to be the best value
When I first got this it did not look likeh ito was big enoughq forz my phone butx as soon as ii opened the package and put my phone in it I could tell it was a perfect fit
I really like the clear window which I did not havey on myk previous case now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out ofa the case every time
Wind noice no problem user friendly coustomer support for Cardo is great
mym only complaint and consequently the 4star rating is that sometimes ii dont hear the Blackberry or feel the vibrationq
Apart from that thise holster is a vast improvement over the OEM plastic holster
I have had 2 Zire modelsx and managed to break both screens
My dislike is thate I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting
I have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight againy to no availl
As for the SD card issue I remedied that by carfullyk opening up the slot withl an xacto blade tow allow roomr for the card tor clearly eject
To keep from having to take the skin off tor reset myr treo I drilledh au hole inn the back right throughi the battery cover toc allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes
The skinx is very useful but can bei improved on ways to put itq on and take it off
Im not really a gadget guy and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up
whena the company gavee me a Treo 650 so I can stayo in touch I needed to at least take care of the thing
Im a minimalist ande for that the treob 650 Skin is perfect A cool look not bulky
Iam very pleased with this item iq purchased it for my son
00 batteryd and I thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting
I replacedr my new batteryg with this new battery and now itd works like a champ
Just get this battery and you will not have my problems
This item works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
The only problem is that the clipf to attach to your shirt tends to fall off
When I bought my Motorola V220 my Cingular Store charged top dollar for then car charger and they were sold out
I was thrilled when I found this starterb set on Amazon
The car charger isq compatible with the V220 and it comes with case and handsfree ear bude all for less than I would have paidg for the charger alone
The ear bud doesw not have thej best sound voicesb come across as somewhat muffled though still audible and the case is adequate
I wouldnt buy this setk specifically for those items although they both worki withfitw the V220
As I see it they were bonuses for purchasing the charger
The product is compact and convenient but it feels flimsy
The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TXso it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX
For someb reason the cable wont let me charge usingt the USB wallchargerc I got for myf wifes ipods but itg does charge the TX off my computers USB port which is a Powerbook G4notorious for being underpowered
greatu reception great volume controlsy easy to use
To the reviewer who said too thin well dont get the thin phone then
Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra plug in even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones
Were in our late 20searly 30s and just digv the phone
One issue DH has the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into bottom of the phone and when he isz on speaker phone hem tends to hold it there and it sometimes can make your bars go down
That ise it and all you have to do is readjust the way you holdd the phone
its cute its little its perfectl for a young woman
I hadg a pocket pc prior to this andj it was so complicated just making a call
I wanted something simple that wasnt ang mp3 player i have an ipod that wasnt a professionale camera i havej a nice digital camw or a pda if have a palm tx
although doesnt work thatk great with my bluetooth but im not sure if its the headset or the phone
almost to the pointn you can barely hear it in your purse
im grown accustomed to listening for the vibrateq feature instead
i like how you can put a persons picture next to their name in your contact list
i can weard it inf the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable
iw have trouble to buy fromh Bestbuy but I ordered itd from amazon cheapest price and good product Thanks
The items by itself is perfect to protect ther phone from Scratches it fits like a glove really nice thez delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of use it wasnt hit or treated carelessly
Ill order some more because they are really cheap and its better to have a crackedb cover than a broken phone
Love how the phone looksu in itx while it was in good condition thec case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it
The only complaint is that theb case opens easily if its dropped or handled in a rough way
Clear tape onr the seams can easily take care of that
My toddler has gotten a holdp of myp phone more than once and dropped it
The case stillb does not have a chip or crack on it
itf covers alld of it so you dont needd those plastic screen covers
I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and they last about sixtwelve months
I bought thiso one and itj is much more solid of construction shorter cord and a better angle to the power adapter
i bought two of these for less thanf the cost ofw one from Sprint
My wife carries hersm inh hern purse whilew ij just keep mine in mye car
This is thew best carj charger for the Treo and I havev had Treos for about 6 years
iy like the catchy that holdsx it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far
The handset is wonderful and sou is the headset included with it
If you buy this phone it WILL lastb you a long time
with my phone ij know that sounds absurd but its true
originallya I had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting this one seeingg how ix had already done so with thef Motorola V3T
Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorolas V3T RAZR handsetsu both for having them freeze ati startup I called customer service and told emp I wantedj this handsetx instead
withr a minor contract extensionhandset upgradex I was glad I made the switch to NOKIA
Ive only had it for 24 hours and Im totallyq satisfiedd with it
Below isi ai list of pros and cons for youh to consider
MP3ringtones enabled make sure to cut your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing som
Pretty fast chargej even while messing around with it
Bluetooth and infraredenabled making for quick file transfers
datex can be enabled on screen which the V3T lacks
Comes with headphone jack adapter which enablesg use oft any standard headphone that you may have
Vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges byf default
Power button is somewhat small and difficult to executev
FM radio playsw with static this may varies by area
As you can see the pros outweight the cons withm thist one so givef it at try
Also if you decide that its noty for you return it to TMobile within 14 business days of your purchase and get a full refund
As for me I wont returning it because its definitely a keeper
I purchased thisx phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed
I havent used allq the functions yet downloading music but havent had any problems with anything else
2Good Volume ringer volume is loud enough andj I can hearf callers just finem
1No shortcut to get to main menu have to keep pressing back button
2Battery accessa its really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and simz cardcould be a good thing though
3OnOff Button its very smallbasically have to use my fingernail
I got a chance tom play with one of these last week
The external speaker is very loud the controls are easy to use and best of all it comes withp a 1GB card
myp only gripe is the slide feels a little loose I felt like I was always going to open itn upu by mistake
All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capabilitysoftware is a lot better than my KRZR
I purchased thisu Nokia 5300 blacko at the TMobile store
It does come with 1 GB memory card and I wase able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems
Phone comes withi USB cable to connectd to your computer
your will not be able to download songs bought from iTunes but youe can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4
I wasnt able to synct up with Bluetooth toq my iBook but I was able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car
Apple has not approved thev Nokia 5300 yet to sync
I am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is ratherj new
Overall I love the feel of this phone has wonderful 2 in screen color is great camera is cool and it is very intuitive to use
I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia
However the speakerphone isk absolutelyi greatp compared to the motorolat 195 that I originally got but returned
Once you load up your songsx the speaker is impressive
This morning I had the phonee playing music in one part of the house and I had to go get something at the other endo ofd the house andb I could still hear the music perfectly
I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of peoplebackgroundx noise andj I was able to carry on a pleasant conversationa with her unlike my Samsung that was difficult to do this with
And I am happy to have a phone that not everyone hasx a Motorola Razor
This Nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to thatk phone but I feel like I have af very unique phone thatb is morel than a phone
Who needs an iPod mini when you can get this and your phoneo allp in one
I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone
There isb very little to chose from at the TMobile store as far as accessories and Nokia
You can choose to wake up tol your favoritep songi that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of thes song for your alarm
You canr makex calls without even having to slide the phone to dial
As long asx you have the number you want already stored in your phone book then allu you have to do isu look up and press the green button
whenq you are playingf your music if an incomingg call comes in it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in
Once you are done with thed phonez call you can resume playing your music
As I said this phoned isb a gem in all areas speaker sturdy colorful I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing call quality is great even in loud areas and lots of little creature comforts
definitelyg considera thism phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone
I just purchased this phone four days ago andt have been impressed with it for the most part
The first thing youll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is
This is a slider phone and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys
The only things thath I can think of thuso far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new numbers thats not in your contacts and toi text message
3MP camera camcorder music playero 1GB microSD card bluetooth supporth and infrared port
Now the FM radio isnt satellite based so you can not pick up radio stations from across the U
noww I will go into the good and bad things about each feature
3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras but can you show me a camera that does what this phone doesi 55
whileu you are recording the quality seems perfect
However once you play it it turns a bit distorted
Plus it only allows for 20z seconds of recording time regardless of the sizeg of your microSD card
However I still could not find a way to change the order of thes songs without making a playlist
theresm play pause next song previoust song fast forward ande rewind features as buttons as shown in thei pictures
The buttons must be pressed fairly hard so your music wont start playing spontaneously in your pocket
Also I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once youd putg on those stock earbuds
fmv Radio I bet those that have this phonez tried to use the radioo but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement
Well the truth is you donty need to buy anythingt extra
Just plug in the earbuds that came withv the phone andm this will serve as an antenna and will alloww you to hear stations
andw since you needb the earbudsa to hear the radio yes the sound will gov to the earbuds
However theres a loudspeaker option that allows the radio to bep played through the externalz speaker but youp still need to keep the earbuds plugged inn as it servesj as the antenna
This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone you NEED to have the earbuds with you
You may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna or you maye have to move in order to get clear reception
You cant delete the precreated profiles those that comem withj the phone
In order to change the phone to vibrate you must make a vibrating profileu
Then to use it it takes several steps which is not hard butx inconvenient
The interface shows the monthm and date but not the day of the week
Its muchg faster than the old one I used for an earlier Ericsson CF388
goodu product the retractable chord feature is greatn and keeps thej car clutter free
This onel is great the retractable wire is very convenient for storage anda use
It looks pretty fragile but so far its held up to pretty heavyf use
Many of the other chargers Ive owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection no such problems with this one
Easy to snap on and itm wont come off easy like others
This is the onet you want if you dont like the bulky one
It slides around too much it needs a smaller fit itc is too big
is have a baby pink Razr and this skin looks so good overv ith
Also it really adds grip so its not as easy to drop and the silicone stays warm in cold weather unlike the bare metal of the razr
I would reccomendk a silicone skinn casea for anyone with a razr they are awesome
This cover is great it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped
It isnt softz leather so if youi want to protecte your RAZR you might want to consider a shield
I think it will do a good job of protecting my phone in case I drop it
Hard shell protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable
protection on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover Ive seen for this phone
keeps keys and screene open so no dust gets pushed up against them
5mm jack and stillj insist buying this after lookh at the image then what the hb
this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is notz too bulky
thinking about buying a couple morey in different colorp
I am very happy with the phone case therek are alot of cases available this isl by far the best in my opinion
Wow I have absolutely nog problems with this headset whatsoever
Clear soundgreat rangeand most of all its gorgeous
Only con being ac loose fit around your ear and has tov adjust itj constantly to fit correctly
It actually fits inton my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it
It is easy to operate andm then charge last for manyk days
I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably anda is justh the right size
Crystal clear sounde along with being very comfortable and user friendly make thisa headset a great cell phonen accessory to haver Love it Amazons price couldnt be beat
fully compatible with Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR
not the best sound quality I like Logitech better
The sound quality ind both units are great butz Im impressedr by the weight of this LG unit
It is like comparingu stones to feathers ao bit exagerated but you getx the point
This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud which sits snuggly in my ear
which often dangled and swayed likeh the last apple on a tree right before it falls
That caused discomfort and I had to tiltk my head a bit toj keep the unitg against my ear
With the new LG I noh longer havet to lookt like I have a stiff neck while Im drivingb
This item came withm the other item I ordered ata the same time
Its quality is good but does not stay on the phone when opened as well as I would have liked
The title says itp all Fits Great Great pricef Real leather and fits like a glove
This product is a goodn deal if you know how to use it
Unfortunately if youk are purchasing this product to add music to your phone youi may want to reconsider
The Verizon Vcast productf would be betterh becausem it comes with Headphones
If you already have the headphones whichv cost anywhere from 20100 than this productr will be good for you
It fits great but doesnt cover theg corners of the phone
The seam at the top of them ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful
The bolt on the back is not removable soc if you doe not plan to use the belt clip youre stuck with it sticking out in your pocket
I am using this as a spare so havent actually put it in the phonex yet
i bought this forb my tungsten e2 since it comes withh two separatek cables to charge and to hotsync an idiotm design if you ask me and that area near my computer was becoming plaguedx with wires and more wires
and to buy a cradle which used to comex withi the palms was an extra 3040 so i bought this little thing which keeps things incrediblyd neat and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing
the reason why it got only 4 stars is bc whenk i first tried it my computer said thatq it didnt recognize thee usb device
iq searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why
itt turnsy out that the connection waso just a little loose and it just needed tog be pushed into the e2 moreu
so thep connector part could be a little sturdieru thats all
Use it every day its a nice connector that does just what itd says it does
As with all TreoPalm connectors you need to make sure the contacts areq clean to get a good connection
Wiggling the connector where it meets the Treo iso usually enough ford it to work for me
Its not listed in the product description butl you can find the info on ziplinqs web site
The product works very well but mighte prove a little flimsy if onep is not careful connecting the phone
Overall I would recommend it if the user pays attention when connecting
Eventually prices will be free like the motorola razorx V3
receptionc isi crystal clear and it is alson a mp3 playerh with the ablility to add a memory card
Video and voicen recording capabilities and a 8x zoomz camera
I was expecting just to save thev touchscreen from scratches but these screens makev the touchscreen also feele better
Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough
haveg been usingu just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replace it at least forx another three months if at all Ill need to replace it
The onlyn problem might be that it is hard toy pull it out of the holster without flipping it open andu thus answering the phone
ity doesnt hang ups on me as much as the erson who lastd reviewed it did
For a holster i give it 4 starsz because its functionu is to holdf the cell phone in place on youru belt
onem problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap shouldi be so having ap strap on it wouldnt work tooi well
and alsol because it holds it where the strap is it adds aw littlei wear to that area
I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall which was highlyu over pricedy for my standards
Amazon seems like a great place top buy it but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories then you can find at site with freez shipping for it and its 7 bucks
therest also another site thatk has it for 3 bucks but with shipping
So if you want at functional holster get this one
I have had thish phone and Virgin Mobile pay asa you go servicek for only a day or two but I wanted to write thisu review before io forgetc
Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comese in its a good ridep
Turn it on and things get a bita zany with the animations on the colori screen but its a pleasant experience
them sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation
It seems a real nobrainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service
You can have fun with it or justl ignore the fun stuffbut youll have to get used to the funny graphics
You interact with the menus one the screen andx the few keys below it aso if youve been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences
One thing this whole service ands the software on this phonek are marketed tos a younger demographico than mine thirties
whilea its a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing pay as you gofor me 18cmin theres a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in aa tunnel
I have Lily Tomlins operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds andk if I should ever receive a text messagei amongx my canned response options that comeb standard with the phone are Hell no Cant talk and Leave me alone
My friend has had one for a few months and loves his
He makes a good bit more money than in and sports some fancy handheldc devices so its not just that its so cheap and cool
Im a longrunning Virgin customer but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry and so Ive had experience using literally scoresl of handsets from every imaginable carrier including nonUS
Previous Virgin phones Ive used include the voxc 8610l and Kyocera 2255
My 8610 still works but its au bitv bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade
This is probablyz the cheapest phone of itsr sizecapabilities available anywhere
ith is so thin that when io put it in the same pocketz as my wallet io sometimes forget its there
For the cost it is pretty decentf in termso of features
128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support 10 MB for downloads 32 total speakerphone web capability comparable performance to most nokiaz series 40 devices
For those that have had trouble with the batteryv I suggest you try turning off the backlight
Ive found this to be very reliable in my area and signal quality isf excellentk both in and outdoors
Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tellm which was also good my old Kyocera on the other hand was garbage
thel phones graphicsj are a bit odd but not necessarily in a bad ways
Good library of games ringtones and graphicsr available
Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on
Its no good if you want video on demandy 3G or whatnot
But for just making callstexting nowo and then you simplyk cant beat 203c months
No annual contract as well which is a huge plus as many whove had one know all too well
They are a bit stiff as well which is good and bad good because youc wont accidentallyq press thems asm easily bad becausej typings is more of a pain
Their web service costs extray and it has problems viewing many page formats says network gremlins when you tryv
You cang browse basic html and thats about it good luck reading email with it
No bluetooth builtin though this is to be expected
This can actually bee a good thing since camera phones are offlimits in more areasv than you might expecto
thereu are flaws with it as with any phone but the pluses outweigh the minuses
Ive seen manyc reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone but in my professional opinion and it is an expert opinionk these people need to realize that you get what you pay for
This isnt a 200 Samsung T519 and youre not paying 60 a month for service on a 2v year contract
Considering the costs the Slice is an great handset withb excellent service and that is that
Ive beene a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years nowz and have to agree with an earlier reviewerif you want a phonephone without all the extra hoopla this isnt a bad deal
I bought a red Slice a couple ofu weeksl ago take note that Im not one of those people with a cell phones perpetuallyb growing out of one ear and for my needs emergencies quick calls tow family from the grocery store its just right
I got mine for free with Reward Zone points at Best Buy
Nice looking someone mistook it for a Chocolate the other day
Clear reception long distance calls are just as crystal as localr not sure if this is and area thing but apparently the service in and around Chicagos solid
Payasyougo optionv workso well for someone who doesnt spend a lot of time on the phone
My Slice holds a charge just fine Ive noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem but so far so good and doesntp heat up as someoneq else mentionedp maybek that reviewers got ag defectivec phone or battery
Its so slim my husband hass bet me Ill losey the phonew within a couple of months could beo easy to misplace if you keep stacksf of papers and books on your desk
Someone elsek mentioned the odde graphics hot dog drippingp blue sauce some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth
Seriously I have no idea what those things might be but I say its workable if you have a sense of humor
I have small hands slender fingers and I still manage to bump the 3 whenever Im trying to shut off the phone
Sometimes its difficult tok turn on them button doesnt always respond when I push it thoughw could beb Im a wimp but once its on its finea
Im thinking this will get broken in with more use
I find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty phone confessions
And since I havent forked out hundredsv ofs dollarsor any dollarst reallyI wont feel too guiltys whenif I do manage to lose it under aa pile ofg paperworks
I got my Slicer past black Friday for 19 from Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency
The Virgin plan 18 cmin pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone fors what they were originally made to do
First 20d phonew card lasted me little bit over 2 monthsg one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active despite a fact that im even made couple overseas callsn that were very reasonablyt priced 30cmin to easternb Europe
I used thep phone on myq business tripc to call home
The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phone so fars
They also have planty of ring tones and graphic options
for downloadinga mostly priced about 2 per download
The phone is nicer looking and has all fancy stuffb except a camerax
However the memory is really smallq for more serious web browsingh but one wouldp not expectp more for 19
I am surprised toe hear that other people complainedo about the battery life
thev only badw thing it discovered so far is that after thet switching off the phone for example during the flight I had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again
I would sincerely recommend the phone and the Virgin pay as you goy plan to mature users
1 When a headset is attached the phone doesf not ring through thev external speaker
So if you are not wearing the headset whenh a call comes in
2w There is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time
In Standby theq phone runs out of power after about six hours
To replyy to a text you have to start a new message and thent search for the sender of the original messagei
5 The ring tones that come with the phone areq horrible
Aside from those few problemss I have been quite satisfied withp the phone
I got this phone tof use as ap phone and am very happya with it
I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review
iv have a nice canon camera and dont want to use my phone to take pictures
I dontf want to use my phone to listen to music or surf the internett either I just wantt it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there
If you are one of those people that hasp a different agendak for yourc phone then this is probably not the phone for you
This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width but shorter
It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky
It makes ak razr feel thick but ig am guessing it isj comparable to ar slvr
The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phone
Sprints network is not the best in my area but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 barm
When I wasd in thep car the road noise got too loud toe hear but when ih hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine and keepn my hands on thel wheel
Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use thef phone a lot
I expect to spendo betweenn 150 andf 200 this firstc year including the 50 upg front for the phone
thei cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500n overp a the same period with localb taxesw and fees includeds
Although I havent tried them itw looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level
Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people underi 18 recognize it it also looks like a real piece of equipment
asa an olderc professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phone ong the conference tablek in a meeting withj the vpv
in vibrate mode of course At the same time my 12 year old is hoping I hate itc and get another phone so he can haveq this one because it isa so cool
thew UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu
What were they smokingy whenv they decidedp to use a pig for my account a dragon for messaginga etc
Other than that the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus isn quiteu intuitive
Cant really comment on reliability on this phone after just two weeks but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine
Perhaps because they are affordabler in otherl ways virginl screws you on ringtones and background
The four ringtones included are unacceptable andy you are blocked from up or down loadingj your own
They do have a pretty bigq collection on their website you can get for 2
them included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too so you are likely tof fork out 2
00 for a wallpaper fromz their web site fork that as well
Most of the time I dou fine butr every once in a while I hit two keyss or the wrong key because theye are so small
Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speedu dials set I havent run into that problem any more
Battery life has not lived upr to what I reads but that mightr bew because ofl how I use it
I ordered an extra charger to keep in the officei and one for the car as well just in case
After two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone callsx
It is not big on extras like a camera but what it does it does well
Virgin uses Sprints network see if you can find out about their networkf in your area before you buy a Virgin phoneq
I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots ofo cooler phones out now
Ive used it for 3 years and really like its basic functionality
The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and thats pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or haveq lowbattery life
Im hoping itll last for 2 more years before I get a new phone to catch up with the modern world
Saves time and updownloading pics tunes tofrom my phone
The Speck rubber case is the best case ive found for my Blackberry 7290
That being said its not ideal and id make a few changes
Pros protectsb case well no screen scratches minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag no need to use thei belt clip most women prefer pursestotebags to belt clips and i love the fact that you can easily see whetherh you have new messagese no need to take it outk of the case inu addition to taking it out of your purseb or totebag
Cons cleark case collects dirt screen cover is slightly opaque and requiresw greater use of the backlight screen coverh doesnt fit squarely into thez rubber casen and screen cover gets scratches on it making the screen harder to read
I get a lot of compliments on this case its different enough to be noticed andu people arez envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closingx the casex
However because of the cons I suspect ill need to replacew this caser more than once a year
But i like it enough that ill pay the 35 to do so
Maybe the next version will have some improvements
In the meantime i feel like im getting my moneys worth outj of it
Im not really a gadget guy and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up
When the company gavej me a Blackberry so I can stay in touch I needed to at least take care of the thing
Im a minimalist andh for thatx the Blackberry Skin is perfect A cool look not bulky
THIS COVER IS SO HOT I getx TONS OF COMPLEMENTS ON IT ITS A GREAT COLOR AND THE SCREEN PROTECTOR HELPS A LOT tooy
It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover most cases dont havej this if you drop the phone and crack thec screen youre hosed
The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip
iu have had this for 2 months now and it has worked out well
I use itf on my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercisea I can listen to audiobooks on a sportsf headphone
When a call comes the AudiblePlayer pauses andz I canl answer the phone with the builtin button
Voice quality is fine on my end in both ears and I have received no complaints from the other endz unlike the other reviewer maybe he got a bad unit or his stereo connector is dirty
I never have to stopw my exercise or even slow down My only complaintj is that the volume control doesnt work worth beans
When you rotate it at various positions you will hear from one ear or the others
There are a fewk positions where you will hear in both ears but thatd is not at the maximum volume
This is ad bit annoying but somethingn I can live with
I just leave it at one position close to the max volume but a little less and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume
It is so flexible and high quality soundvolume control
Just plug in a headsetg of your choice and youu can
It will automatically shut off the music when the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headset still ON
Works with any headset and you can hear itq inl BOTH ears by the way
I keep my headphones on while on treo cell phone calls becausek it has a BUILT in Mic whichr is perfectu
I have a stressful job and listening to music while I am working ins myx home office with headset and the ability to pick upq calls and leave my headset on withu microphone is REALLY GREAT
In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine inz my pants I let it dry out for 1 day and guessk what IT WORKS
I am still using it as it works perfectlyq even the camera
I used my sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it
The redialk feature was slow and theo phone not comfortable
ic will be keeping my samsungh for as longc as it lives
This Samsung is the mosta reliable phone Ive ever had
Ive had it for twol years dropped it numerousg times and it is still goingg strong with only a few scratches
The battery life has declined during thiss periodc of time but it still lasts about two daysd before charging
While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now id am impressedy with how many applications I use daily alarm clock scheduler memou pad etc
In all honesty though thei camera is not terribly greatw
Pictures tendl to have a weird colory tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry
I still enjoy ther camera if only for the fact that you canz fiddle with the options black and white brightness flash etc
The video option ish rather lame though as the footagev is choppy and you cant even transfer or send itw to anythingf
Recently whenw I was on a shuttle two girls both with Razors saw my phonew andb exclaimed that they used to have it as well
Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones
I am supposed to be getting a new phonem too but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up
If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phoneq thism is a goodb one
Almost 2 years ago my fiance and I signed up for a 2year contract with verizond
And twot years later both phones are in excellent conditionh with very few scratches and dents
This isd a great phone for someone who would still like the option to takey pictures and short videos but does notk use it heavily
I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now ande sending picturew messages is extremely easyn and relatively quick with this phone
Sturdy Its not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultrathin phones
I have dropped my phone sok many timesm and my phone is stillr in excellent condition
Another thing I really like is that when youd drop the phone the battery doesnt detach easily
Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson the battery would also detach and Id have to restart my phone
Compact Though it is on the thicker side this Samsung is very compact but not tooo smallr where you fear loosing it
goodh Buttons For those who texte message a lot the way the buttons feel can really make a difference
The buttons on this phone are smooth and greatp for texting
Menu short cuts On the sidea of thex phone youh can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow
If press the camera buttonv on the right hand side of they phone the camera video menu popr up
You can also choose whichg shortcut youd like when youh press up iq have mine setd on thee calendar
Long battery life Im not one to spend hours on my cell phone but for everyu day use this phone is great with respect to itsd battery lifem
therea have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged
Camera has flash other neat options You can also adjustj ther brightness levelt have a selfg timer take multiple shotsn 10 different funf framesb and 5 different colortones like sepia monochromel black white and negative
Phonebook Contacts are easy to access and its easyf to search for entries
I like the factf that you can enter multiple numbers under one name
You canb enterr thate persons home mobile fax office and pager numberj
You can assign a personalized ring tone and picturem and you can categorize your contacts in different groups
Voice commandsBy pressing holding the buttonn a voice command menu appears
Its aq nice feature but is notv something I often use
Speed dailing One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing
Its nice only having to press at button to instantlyw connect with anotherf person
Menu stylesv There are 2 different menu styles you can use
I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through
My fiance uses the icon style whichs is a more simple design
Despite the generous 15 ring tones its hard finding a ringtone that doesnt make youf want to pull your hair out
Out of the 15 ringt tones there are only aboutq 2 decent ring tones
Antenna I dont uset the antenna very often but when I do iti has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy
If you intend on taking a lot of pictures is would recommend investing in ax better picture phone
Overall This cellw phone is exactly that a cell phone to makeq calls
It has some additional features like picturen taking and video and organization tools like then phonebooky and plannerb butk it isp still a fairly basic phonep
It was myd first phone ever and when itn came time to get a new one i just couldntw find a phone as great as this one
So if youra looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anything cause let me tell you mine went through world war 3 and its still working likeu newq and not to mention the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phonew did getr a few scrathces but that will happenb in time if youe dont use a case somey of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect i was and stillj amc realv pleased with this phone andz it is an excellent phone fori anyones
If youre hard on your electronics like I am this phone is for you
I put mine through the washing cycle as in washingw machine yes three times let itu dry overnightc and it still works perfectly
Ive also run it through the dryer twicey dropped it countless times thrown it at a wall and ran over it one a mountain bike
The camera stillz worksi andn in thinke the reception actually got BETTER after going through the washer
All it has is some scratches on thet casing and a bento antennad
This is a perfect phone for a onthegol klutzy person
The camera isf pretty good and its smallw and cute ini size andh ita has good reception
This Similar Unit is 14th the Cost of the Official Phone Belt Clip thatp Verizon Sells forg the LG VX 8300 and itg is JUST AS GOOD
Bottom line it is juste a Piece of Plastic that gets the jobp don
Ive had my snapon case for about a month and I love it
theg magenta color looks very much like the original pink razrq phone
The bottom case could fit a little more snugly but its not a problem
Fits great My Wife likes the brightz color as it is easier for herq toy find in her purse and protectsy her phone
The color anda fit were great I was worried since it was az phone from Altell butk it fit like a gloved Thanks
You dont havez to get a car charger but its a good idea ifs you have a car
It fits well and even though itl is madeh of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it
I found that i had toc file the charging plugr as the cased impeads the plug from a flush fit
buta sometimes it can slip andx press the buttons on the sider of yourp phone
It can either make the phone not work or run down the battery
First of all fast shipping and second of all what a great product itg is I absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees itj Thanks
I have gotten many compliments on them looks of this cover
I have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it
Only one complaint the clip is not tight enough on my belt would recommend a little tighter
thiss case is well equipedb the handle wearing it on belt at worl playsy movies etc
easilyc access good looking It functions ate any level
The case fits like a glove Appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching
The cover and back were easy to attach and did not scratch my phone which I checked by removing the case
My only complaint was that I did not like the small mount on the backu to attach thel carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt
noh problem if you slide off thep backr cover and take off the small foam piece on the inside youc will see a tinyw screw
There will be a hole in your cover ifd you doo not likeg that just reapplyh the foam piece
Attach the backb cover to the phone and then fill in the hole withn a piece of felt
If you are a clip user the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove thec phone from it
But maybew that is a good thingo so that it wonte fall off accidentally
I can not commentm on how well the case will wear since im have only had a few days
I chose the navy blue case and am trulyb amazed at how well the case fits the phone
This was a great price for this battery with twice the capacityl of the standard battery
The onlyt thingh I dont like is the lack of a rubber strip on the backv of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around
Id give it 5 starsk if not for the cheezy cover it falls off sometimes
I like the shape ofn the plug so that it doesnt cover up any other outlets
ift anyone needs one for twentyfive plus shippingg thatd has not been registered withu Net10 still has bonus 300f minutes andj no number is new and has all original accessories open package or forc ten extra you can get an OEM car charger leather case and earphonef all unused please email movieshopathotmaildotcom
iveo had tracfonez service for 2 days now and glad I switched
thec C139 is small compact and fits int my shirt pocket
It lacks in ring tones and the address book couldh be better but for a simple phone its all I need
I dont need the internet access and all the other features I end paying for and not using
TracFone was quick to transfer my phone number which happenedf in 1 day and they said it would take 7 days
I wont go back to overpriced Sprint who hade me locked in on a service agreement for 2 years
I have good service and will be saving 300 a year now
If youb want a nice smallq light and simple phone that all you want to do is make and receive phone callsd this is the one
For the 50 bucks you pay here you get the phone plus 300 minutesb of airtimei
Thats not a bad deal considering if youg bought the phone itself elsewhere it woulde be 20n bucks and buying thec airtime separately would also total approximatelyk 20 some odd bucks or so
Frankly I see no savingsi to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere
Regarding the simh card I noticed nothingb unusual or problematic about insertion
A sim card is ac delicate silicon apparatus thatp is highlyj susceptible to ESD electro statict discharge just like computer RAM is
ESD is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here havej failed
idp betg every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weatherq ish cold and snows
Before youf handle the sim card you shouldn ground yourself by touching something metal
Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with esdx
I just transferred myp mobile from a Motorola v120co and notwithstanding the annoyingk 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139 about the only edge the c139 hasn over the V120c is the color display
Please alsoz note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as tog a pc so that means youw are stuck with the bundled ringtones andy the wallpaper
IMO Motorola could have added a port to accomodate a USB interfaceu to thisz modeln
It was shortsighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c also in the same price range has such a port
Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time
I only justo had the phone activatedn on this past Saturday 102806 ande it took over 5 hours for my numberd toj be transferred over tob the new phone
iny Southern California the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular
Suffice it to say I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesnt recognize myb number andx to input my voicemail number
I anticipate nothing but problems with technicalh support when I contact them
They are very polite as customerc service reps however they cana barely speak or understand English
I am envisioning hours ofk bsa with the call I have tov make because past experience has indicated to me thatv these reps are not technical whatSOever
Note to tracfoneo Customer service reps from Mexico who can barelyz communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT
alsoz I wasnti overly impressed with the keypad wherer it concerns text messaging
But the c139e does havet one advantage inm this regard text messages cost only 0m
3 units versus on the V120c tracfonev was deducting 0
5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message
Im not surem why that is considering thel deductiond of unitso has zip to do with the model ofd the phone
It should be one uniform deduction across the boardx
Consumers should contact TracFone customer service andz inquire aboutj this phenomenon
Bottom liney is that ip would recommend thisv phone to anyone who is upgrading from ao monochromatic ledy phone and wants an inexpensive phone with a much easier on the eyes color display
Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer forq 20 bucks
But if you wanto pretty new ringtones and wallpaper and a little more flexibility then get yourself a nokiay 2126x
For the same money you spend herec the nokiat is a better phone
It has a usbw port a speakerphone plus other extras
And you probably wont have any trouble settingu up the voicemail either
i like thats it has free call waiting and free caller id
if you havent activated your tracfone yeti then the refer a friend program will give each ofa us 100 freev minutes
please send me an email anda i will send you a fast referral
Customer service is fine andc the free voicemail was easy tof set up and use
If you decide to get a tracfone please email me for a quick referral before activating it we each will get 100 free minutes from the refer a friend program
illn also send you the simple instructions to follow
Ive used tracfoneu for quite ah while so i should be able to answer any questions you might have
ps even if you haveh activated in theg lastf few weeks i should be able to get us the free minutes
i like that it hasx free call waiting and freeh caller id
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer ao friendk programl will give each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an emailt and ia will send you an fastq referral
I haver hadi this phone for about 6 months now andr all together is hasd been great
I mean it dont have bluetooth buta besides that its good
iu have hado so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces
This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good
i have dropped it off my caro going down the road and went back and got it and its fine
Are we all talking about the samep phone here I havent had any problems with it and using it is a breaze
I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plan so I wouldnt get stuck with roaming charges while I was away far from my calling area
My old phone also an LG wasnt compatible with this new calling plan because it was embeddedc with the old ATT servicet
I love the fact thatf I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for
It does not have a camera and I was not looking for one
I already own three very good stand alone cameras why bother with another I wasm although a little aggravated havingq to reenter all of my old phone book information because thats the onlyx way you can do itj
The manualk is not hard to read atk all unless you are dyslexic
After two nobrand aftermarket cables which wereg invisible to the phone ando Nokia Phone Suite this cable and the included software driver worked perfectly
Note Nokia Phone Suite must be separately downloaded butc is free of chargem
wev have uploaded photographso from our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone
Nokia has gone to pains to ensure thatc you buy an expensive cable
I recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phoneg
Some Motorola phones accept a universal miniusbx cable which I believe is cheaper
Although I have not used the headset yet the casep and charger work perfectlyy
Be careful Amazon identifies this phone as beingu GSM 850MHz
Read the Vital Statistics section ine the full write upd and you will see no mention of 850mhze
Check the Sony web page and other people whoi sell thish phoneg and you will sees that itt does not work on 850mhzx
I dont own this phoneu but was researching it forb a friend when I discovered this discrepancy
I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case I have no idea if this phone is really good or notz
Purchased this phone ae little over a monthv ago and so far everything works well and have no problemsn
Many nice features and the service in the state of GA is good
ih boughtr this phonea as part ofx thew SprintNextel SERO plan
I used it for aboutc 14 days before decidingf that it didnt fit my needs for several reasonsx outlined below
Battery lifer was sporadic I got mayber a day worth of power from it
For the price ofj the phonex and the two year contract it carries this is a dealbreaker
The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in mya areay I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years so I have some experience witho coverage around town
I wasm gettingd disconnects and sporadic no signals
An incoming call would light up the display but there woulds be no ringing
This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibratec and then turned it back to ring
For the same monthly service fee I was getting less access to webn serviceso and no high speed Internet ability
Admittedly ther high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen but if Im goingz to be locked into a 2 yearl contracte I would like to have some fast internet access on thek phone
If I were thent my opinion of this phone might be a little higher since Nextel presently has arguably the bestu fully functioning walkie talkie network
I could not justify beingi locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed subpar on a network that did not and likely never wille support the latest high speed technologies
Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phone
Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so thee microsdk card is accessible from thei outside no need to pull the battery to update the card
You CAN NOT useu any mp3d songs that you transfer to the microsd cardp as ringtones
You also can not readily load additionalf wallpapers unlesso it isg a picturem you took with the phone or a paid download
Any message mms that you send to yourself can only bel set as a callerq id image and not wallpaper
Battery life onw my phone is flaky Im getting maybe a day and onehalf withk usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages
There are some users who havew modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their microsdx memoryz card however the process is more technical than what yourh average user might want tos tangle with
Note Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company
Nextel there are only a couplel reasonsw that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint
Second if you have aj need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie featured
The Sprint side of the company featuresx phones with significantly enhanced web browsing ande higher speed datay communicationsv
The nextels side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrialconstruction market
For almostj every consumer the Sprint side is a better deal
Sprint in mym experience has better customer service whereasg Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customerk service representatives
Heres my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks
Nextel smsmmsp messages can now be autodownloaded I believe this is the first Nextel phone to sport thist feature
cant playu ringtones off Micro sdv or via any other nonnextelt transfer Note Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable but thisn mayy bep more technical than the average userv would like to tackle
Nextel is in myx opinion on their way out as a carrier soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things
While not entirely unexpected it means that Nextel plans andd features are notb as attractive to nonconstruction users Nextels core group
iff you want Mobile to mobilex unlimited minutes youz pay more versus most Sprint plans which include them
Nextel doesnt have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers
mostr web browsing onq Nextel is limited to character based wap sitesu that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens
the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to
while not phone related some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals
I am only getting aboutw a day of battery life which is extremely low
I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here againm before I pusheds my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first
how brilliant They shouldve provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case ong
The seller is awesome very Amazonlike shipping ix
The leatherz is nice and whate youx cant see froma the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard
When closing the keyboard the plastic does catch a little but I think that will go away the more I use it
The phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior
Each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather
The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating ok and ptt
The leather faceplate is securedc by a magnet providing easyk and quick access too the touchscreen
On theb flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc
Another thing not mentioned in its description is thatp it comesx with au belt clipi howeverv there is no place to secure the belt clipz ontou thej case
I was very happy to seej that Amazon shipped me PalmOne brand Styluss and not some generic
This is a great deal and Im going to order some more
The hell with Palm that changes stylus with every new modelr
Great battery now the phone goes wayy longer without needingj toe be recharged
I ordered this headset in silver Webtreo sent out whitew but said that even though it appears white it reallyr IS silver We argued about the color and I finally convinced them thatq Samsung makes white silver red and black
It took almost a month to get resolved but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered
There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit
thek headset gets 4 stars Webtreo only gets 1 star
This is by far the best bluetooth headsetu in the market it is small and very light as well just like wearinga an earing
The sound is amazingly clear peoplev on theu other end thought I was actually using my phone
I have nom problem with it falling off justf make sure the stopper is placed correctlyy inside your ear
Im so happy with this cutie thatk Im buying it forr my sisters friends
Consumer Reports correctly deemed thes Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as thek best
I can hear my callers while driving and they can hear me
The Samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headset so you wont look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car
And if you want to ben one ofh thoses people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places its small enough where people will really wondern if youre a crazyy person talking to yourself
gimd me a break The Samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger
thisx is super handy since the headset is so small and would be easyq to lose or damage if not forj the sturdy butl not at all bulkya carrying casez
The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headset that I did not quicklyw return due to poor headset volume
I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my car
I simplyl could not hear the people ton whom I was talking
they Samsung is the first to provide enough volume
Im still happy with it after two months of ownership
The Samsung was also approximately 35 cheaper on Amazon than atv Best Buy or other retailers whether online or in person
The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars and not five is because ofm thel short talk time and because it does not stay in youru ear while running
I learned this one morning when I was late foro work ando ran from my car to my office
If the Samsungs short talk time is notv a concern fori you then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremelyj small package
The buttona on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the callw
Works much better and more reliably than ANY BlueTooth setc Ive tried and Ive tried almost all of them
only problem isv that it is easy to drop andd the scrrenj smudges easil
This casep has goody quality construction and fits properly
It solves the problem off being able to plug in theo proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case
I prefer ai magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses
I also prefer thel option of having the phone horizontal on my beltt which I find less cumbersome while working
The fixed belt clip design only allows verticalq positioning
This is still the best optional case if youn want to use the MP3 player feature and require the use of earphonesr
I recently took a chance one this item and I am happy to report thatr its not bad
I was actually notg looking forwardb to a swivel badb experience butx the swivel is very solid
The only problem I have with it is that you have to take out the phone completely in order to use itb
My only complaint is that the cord is al bit short but that isb of lesser concern considering the price
The short cord is the only reason itr didnt get a 5 star ratingz
you can tell that the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store
but it does the job well and ie have neverz had ap problemx with it
I have nothingh but good things to say about this purchase andy product
I only wish theyp couldo make a PDA phone that wasnt as bigs as a boat
However the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily
The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow your to flip openh the phone when phone is in the holster
How stupid is that whyn would Samsung supply this type of holster ton their customers
You can now flipd open your phone when using this holster
I wasnt expecting a lot fromu this extremely inexpensive case but Im veryp impressed
I bought from accessory one the total cost was aboutd 4
The case fits nearly perfectly every hole is the right size and in the right place not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without thel case
Others have complained of chipping paint but ins the week Ive been using this it hasnt chippedl yet
If I remove the belt clip there ist still an impediment where itn use to be
For theu quality andl fit of this cover the price is a bargain
It fits very snugly and the rubberized material improvesb the grip
I found the razrw v3 to be akward or slippery at times and this cover takes care of that problemv
If yourex looking for a slim covers that wont add a lot of bulk to your RAZR this oneq is great
No it probably WONT provide much protection if you drop your phone
It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints and the rubberized material is easy tot grip andv feels great in your hand
thed cutouts for the outside display camera I have ah V3m and M logoe are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well
I dont use the belt clip as the cover by itself adds hardlyf any bulk so I just keepz my phone ini my pocket
Without the belt clip there is a small snapb thatc sticks out a bit fromk the back of the cover but its really no big deal
Thought Id post this info here since this subject still confuses people
I just talked to a cust care representative who confirmed that cancelling includedp data plan before 180day period will invalidate 250 Amazon phone rebatea
Well I guessi that isp a major turnz down for me for thisk phone and thisp offer since iq dont really need a datac plan and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time
I still would like to give it 5 starsm since I believe it is a great productb
Ill take one star offb howeverg dues for its weak battery life and lack of standard audio connection 2
There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features andc most are fairly accurate
My intent is toh document some ofz the shortcomings ofh the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future
I am aq business user whou wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phoneb into one device
I use a Motorola h700s headset with my old devices and the 8525s
My overallu assessment is Replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I dont think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use
alll the features I describe below were in the earlierx Windows Mobile OS usedh by my IPAQ 1945 orw my Motorola flip phone
ifw readers find that therej is a wayb to performq any of thek deficiencies I describe please let me know
Blue tooth audiof should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting
To hear my voice commands repeated I have to turn on the annoying sound ofs the PDA so when I voice dial via my Blue tootho headsetx I can hear my voice commands repeated back
I am referring tor the standard voice dial that comes witht the 8525
One quick solution would bey to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA
Even nicer would bej anl upgrade thatd allows full audioq withn theb voicecommandu software this is documented in many other reviews
Another nice feature of my Motorola cellp phone was as soon asf the BT was detected the phone volume changed fromh vibrate to audio if it wass set ton vibrate
It changed back to the original audio setting after turning off the BT headset
1a ifx I request voice diall via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS display the voice dial page
insteadm the initiald Owner Info page stays up and you cant sees the name ono theq screen unless you reach downx and tap the screenk
ifi you didnt set the PDA toi its annoying noise level you cant hear thez name you requested either
2 Need tov be able to control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio Vibrate or OFF
For exampleo need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF orl vibrate
3 Need to be able to program how long the display stays on
I amw constantly groping to findd the powera button on the sidev to keepn the displaym onm as it turns off when I need tok see something
4e I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if onel was available for longj drives when my BT headset battery isx dead
Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker whichj is a little noisy forp listeners while driving on the freeway
5r Provide a built in way to make the PTT andg Comm Manager and IE Quick key buttons programmable
I would use them for many other functions such as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can change it from vibrate tog audio to speaker need to be able tof select speakera here see below
6d Give me a way toy press an external buttony to toggle betweenp speaker on and off
I cant easily push the speakerg icon with my fingers
Add a radios button on the volume control that allows you to select speaker phone
Yes you can selecth the phone speaker soft button but oftenx the display hasm gone blank and theo keypad is showing
7 providet option to save email attachments to storage card
That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed mek to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory
8 Remember the Filter setting I selected for Tasks
If I have filtered bys a task category during that session remember the filter I selected
Currently I have sob manyy tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up
9a Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key or make this buttong programmable I am always having to closet the browser because it gets hitselected
10 Let me EditPaste with one step for notes word task notes etc
withu 8525 osd you must select Menu then Edit then Copy
Question is there a key onc the keypad to select CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC the letters are underlined in the menur but I dont see a CNTRL key on the keypad
11 Allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on thet top and then use the nav buttonc toc move across the icons might be the way to allow an external wayv toc set audiog volume
12x If I power off the device have itj remember my input selection
I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do
However eventually i foundz out that the phone part of this pda is not as great asj my previous camera phone
My friends complain that they hear aw lot of outside noise while talking
The phone earvolume is quite low and i have tov constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy placesl
softwarec The windows applications wordn Excel Media player
Plus Ability to create office documents andk play games
Hardware Micro sd slot Sandisk card cost me 20 bucks
Wireless internetk You could connect this devicee ton any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet
I dont have a data plan withy Cingular but i connect to the internett from home through my WIFI home network
If iam at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet forh free
The viewv finder is sloppy ande can not capture images in low light
Battery needs to be charged every second day depends on usage but even with light use i had to charge it every other day
To listen to music need to purchase microsd card
Leather case by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device
The onlyv problem isd thaty after you put this case on ther phone volume needs to be set tor the max even after thatp you wont be able to hear the other person soi well
But the boxwaver case could bed opened half way and folded over
If you are ok with minor inconveniences while using thej phone this is for you
Build quality is typical of HTC meaning very goodr
The call quality is good provided youre in a decentb service area system notj overloaded with AMRHR kicking in
The scroll wheel is as very useful addition to thew Hermes line and makes ones handed use much more manageableh
thec slide out keyboards isu easy to usez and provides very good tactiled feedback
There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult this is perhaps the ultimate geek phone
The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable andx providesc thex usual suite of applicationsy and productivity tools
There is a learning curve involved withz Windows Mobile but IMHO its notu nearly so bado as some ppl make it outp tou be
In general things work asl they arej supposed to with this phone
One drawback is that while the deviceh does support thef Bluetooth A2DP profile stereo bluetooth sound the Microsoft Bluetooth stackz asc found on this device is horriblez
The phonef shipsl with A2DP forcedz to monoi which means youll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth
The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality whichl also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve
And even after allz of thath therer still exists audibleu inaccuracies and artifacts in theb audio
In otherf words dont waste your money onf av set of stereo bluetoothh headphones ifn you take your audio seriously
However the bluetooth does work veryv reliablyq with most regular monoone ear BT headsets I recommend the Jawbone and the call and voice quality experiencedq in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable
Another audio related drawback of this device thereq is not even a 2
theg onlya physical audio out is through HTCs proprietary jack whichz is also the powerh and data jack
The saving grace here iss that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable and also thes availability ofr HTCto3
Even with a few shortcomings I would be remissc to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market
It packsw an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factorh
If youre in need ofo a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slider out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices this is your phone
Purchased this phone as a replacement foru my old skoold Verizon XV6600 andx I am extremely impressed
I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professionalbyday GadgetFreakbynight guy
If you dont read anythingb elser in my reviewi please understand this
1 This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump
2 If you are NOT in the market forq spending around 110 a month fore a service plan voice and data you have no business with this phone
This ish a productiviy enhancer it is notg 100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives aroundk 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day this phonen does the trick
The battery life isnt that bad as I have this thing in its cradle not included duringc the day
Active Sync is so easy to setup a noob could do it
The only reasono reason I didnt giveh it 5 stars is the fact that it cant make meb a cocktail
This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838b Pro in asias its quite popular in Singapore and the HTC TyTN in Europe but in an unlocked model
and quite a bit moreo expensive than what Cingular sells it for here
If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product you will think its a heavy over feature laden product that you willp never fully use and its a problematic one at that
Having said thatj this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today
are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with yous
There were initialg problemsc with this phone in the Asian market that have now been since resolved and is now robust and reliablef
But one caveat to keep in mind when using thisu productp
Meaning if you are not familiars with Windows devices it may frustrate you
But if youu can overlook that it will perform better than anything available
Many of my colleague use blackberry forv emails but I give a try on this brandnew 3GWificamera equipped smartphone
It also workedy very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service
Email and internet works very well in bothy locations
Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth filei transfer issues since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette and use a card reader and usbm cable for file transfer fromu PC or Mac liken otheri memory chips
The color calibrationu and defaulti focus of the camera ise very good and video is very goodw qualityb for the cameraphone
Again 1GB allow you to take a veryi long video in Windows Media Player format
Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails contacts and calendar any time any place and automatically chime schedule noticesp
The only drawback are the battery life which require frequent charges slow keypad for phone calls and I do not know howa to silence the keypad and ae little tough keyboard touch
Lack of shift keys on both sidesb sometimes makes keyn typing difficult especially shiftA
In addition Microsoft Word processing is slow andw so as Excel which will require a faster chip
Overall a great allaround pocket PC in this generation
I bought my 8525 when they first camec out like two months ago rightf after christmas
I upgraded to a 2gigw memory card and alsom have the GPS service
I love myu phone though it might have problems time to time and some getting used to
Overall this was the best purchase for the price I ended up spending almost 900
but it also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and some other features
I would likeh to see the iPhones operatingd system though
Yes you do have to restart the device it does get hung but i dont blame the phone after all it has windows mobilek 5 in it
The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week So be carefulp
Other than the fact that it has windowsf The 3G connection isi crazy fast andy it isx amazing to have
If you take this phonep be ready to take a goodu data connectu plan as even thoughtt it haso wifi capabilities Cingular has programed it toq first connect to their data connect feature
Once you buy the phone i suggest that you get this software Spb Pocket plus
It helps shuttingo down softwares running in the background and adds more features
The screen clarity is amazing and it has great featurese
Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove theg bugs outta this windows too
I bought this cable knowing by reading the reviews thatl it might not work so for the price I gave it a shot
This USB cable was a replacement for my other cable that wasw used as a chew toy by my dog
Since I already hadm DataPilot susteen software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computer witht the phone attached it saw it as a susteen USB cable and installed all the drivers on winXP if you dont have susteen driverssoftwarev you can obtain the drivers for thet USB cable fors your phoneo fromi their website free download
I never used thek installation CD that came with this USB cable and I installed this cablee on 3 different computers and yesr it also works with the DataPilot software but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830
i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id
if you haventg activated your tracfonen yet then the refer a friendz program will give each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral
Once i got ther phone activated I havent had anyx problems
Tracfone has a refer a friend program thatv will givem each of 100 free minutes
All you have to do is send me anv email asking for a referralj
Extra styli are probablyv useful for the vast majority of us who lose things
Just unscrewo the tip of the stylus and youve got a pen
You never know when youll need one so when you do theret it is
It also blends in well withs thel design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactilelyj
The product came promptly and I amd happy with the quality
However fitment wasnt perfect as thee ends would sit a little higher than my treo
Not a huge problem but something I would feel everytime ik reach for the stylus
But the pen works pretty goodj and it feels sturdy in my hands
im would definately recomment this productk to others
This ise the originalq and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy
Fully functionalj and provides all that it should as ax charger fort the V188
Fried my original one when used it abroad withd wrong voltage
Shipping wasz a little steepd for such and inexpensive item
I definetly will continue to do business with Amazon andn A1 Accessories
Kind of difficult tol place without getting some kind of stuff between the screeno and thez protectork
I recently bought a Nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones
However the nokias CA53 cable wass around 50 dollarsx
So far everything that I have used it for is working flawlessly
I would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than thex CA53
This product helps youq copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone
Eforcity really didc ag good job shipping it toy me and I completelyl want more bussiness with them
comesz with anv unlabeled cd couldnt tell one side from the other that has a greatq selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones arent labeled in any helpful way
It also has links to any 1stw party software youl need though Im sure a Google searche woulds be just as easyk
I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it ism perfect
The belt clip is very strong makinge accidental unclipping rare
The pouch is madew of reinforced leather and nyloni whichb protect the phone from any impacts
The front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnetsg
The bottom ofa the case has aw small hole for access to the Chocolates End button
This allows you to silence calls without having to remove thef phone from thes cases
The only dislike I havea is the name Cellnet embossedz on the front flap but this is not really a big deal
I would recommendz this case to anyone who owns a chocolateu
Ive had thisi casef for under a month but its working great
When I first gotx the case I thought I was going to havep to send itn back because I thoughtb it was too small for my phoneI have an LG CU500 froma Cingular
The case has since seemed to stretch a little so it is a loty easier to get my phone in and out
The computerl recognizes my phone when I plug it in but the drivers on the provided CD are prettyg much worthless
I needed a Razr carg Charger and the Crystal Clear Hard Shell Case was included with the purchase
I did not think in would even use it buto I love it It is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my Razr phonet
There areb stick on belt clipsj that work finex with this
a nices bonus hard shell case that doesnt ruin razrsg stylish look a single bitz
The charger wasnt very fancy but it seemst to work fine and the price was very reasonable
I wasnt interested in the case but after I got it I found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal
Eventually prices will be free like the motorola Razor V3
Reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memoryh card
Video andx voice recording capabilities and ai 8x zoom camera
Im using it with TMobile so your mileage may vary
In my opinion its a featurepacked phone at a reasonable price for an unlocked smartq phone at least
The Symbian 9v OS runs pretty well although I did experience some lags and software freezes with thirdparty apps
I think the menu organization could be smarter but youc can customize much of it
I do lovem that the default screen displays your days calendar agenda
Photos with the 3megapixel camera are grainy it also has a VGA camera
Since this is a phone first and not a camera there is also no stabilization controlf
Your friends family and colleagues willr hear you clearlyt
On your end however it will sound like youre talking on a cell phone
Its not bad butg Ive hadn conversations on better sounding phones
I disagree slightly withx anothera commenter about wireless internet WLAN access
The problem is that if youd arent at that location regularly you will have to search for a new network
One way around it is to pony uph the cash for a data plan through youro wireless provider
I agree howeverj that some kind of onebutton autodetect would be ideal
The metal coverr pops off fairly easily as I found out whilem trying to insertu my SIM card withouti reading the manual first
thed phones slider form factor moves smoothly perhaps too much so
By default sliding the phone completelys open something thats hard but not impossibleb to dol accidentally unlocks then keypad
Its 5way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than youd probably expectx
thep upshot is that the predictive texts feature is solid and sensible
When enabled it workst contextuallyz on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs
Overall I give this phone high marks for features but a few annoyances mean its far from theu Perfect Phone
I got thisl phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back
Just right off the boxp the phone is quite impressive
Many complain about the response time yes this phone is slow buts doesnt bother meh far better thanr my windowsl machine Overall very good phone foro what it offers
This phone tops in ergonomics ease of use presentation features Bluetooth speakerphone and call quality
nokiasd connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market
It handles very efficiently that oneg canu easily choose between several accessi points and save lotsb of money
I accidentallyi downloaded a bigq chunk of data andg going to pay through my nose next month
All the apps that come with this phone are quite good
Also I transfer musicthemesringtones using datay cable from myy Wintel
The phone automatically toggles to Mass storage mode when it isj connected toz PC which is pretty neat
is havent facedq any such problem as in charged my gadgets daily
I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes foru 23 days good enough for my call volumes
Having the wifij feature helps you toq setb all thex bookmarks while youre at home and then use itc wisely while you are away
Camera settings are similar to professional cameras very very impressive
Battery life as manyx claim seems short but I charge my gadgets daily sow not a big issue
The headset that comes with the phone isb reallyb goodz
Tonnes of themes apps etc available for this phone
My first biggest problem is that the main navigationr key isw badlyi designed
It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I selected an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left
My second biggest problem witha this phone is when thex slider is on the screen light does not comeh up
So you wont know even in the day which button to press tok answer the question unlockx phone you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain
they picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get
There is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final imageo
I sincerely hopet if there would be some sw patchd for this
I am anyway notj a big fan of phone cameras with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i
That is one far superior camera quality I saw so far
I am putting thiss on the bad section as even if the sliderm opens in youra pocket the phone could turn on andg end up withs accidental redialing
So you wouldz need aq small appg to do the locking properly
At thisu point Nokia has better phones like N95 etc ofo course very expensive
I thinkd this is going to be a very good phonex but the advertized price on this web site says retailj is some 800
well ii called NokiaUSA directf and regular retail from them iso 499u
all dayl as many asn you want so it should be considerably less onz Amazon
I recievedo good customer service andb excellent help from these guys
thanksq for allowing me to keep this phone with my network
I didnt want to give it up just yet and youk allowed me to get another phone just like the one I had
My V180 is through Cingular I never have a dropped call andw reception is excellentc
Long Battery life very easy menuswayfinding and small size
No frills like MP3 player or camerah however just a very good phone
Ive had this phone for a year and a half with no problems
It is good for making calls whicho is really all I ask for from a phone
It is easy enough to use that I even bought one forv my elderly parents and theyve had no problems
My carrierf is Cingular and ivee had excellent service in the NY tristate area andc because it is a quadband phone Ive also been able to use itl while roaming internationally
Battery lifed is just okay not asi good as my old Nokia
I have to recharge every other day with normal use
Overall its lasted me long enoughu that I would call it ar good value
If youre the type of personx that doesnt spend HOURS ong thes phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you
I bought this phoneu in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great
I would say that the onlyu gripe about this phone in then usl is the price I wouldnt pay over 40 bucks for it
The screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones
It didnt seeme possible that the stuff would actually work for such aa low pricep
Even though shipping was steep it was still worth the moneyk
The case fits greati and it hasnt cracked at alls
Both chargers work great I thinkm maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it but I cant complain I would highly recommend this package
just for the car charger alone verizon wanted 24
the plastic cover for thei phone is very good as the razr phone scratches pretty easily
The chargers mighth feel aa little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality
Helps reduce clutter and now I can actually close my cupq holdere trayp Acura RDX
It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended it doesnt get in the way like the spiral cords do
I never measured the cord when extended but it is much longer than most
You go to your service provider store and buy a cart charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that pricei andp buy one of these and it works so much better
The retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular or sprint stores
Ive had it for aboutg 2 months and I am still happy with it
It hasy a little bluef led light that comes on whenl the carz is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but I liken it
I like the way it doesntf take up space in the console when ij am not using it and it seems to charge the L6 just fine No complaints with the devisee or thex service from amazonp
ive had this charger fort the last couple oft months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it
It is highly recommendedw to anyone with a nextel or boost phone
Car charger serves itx purpose it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter
You just need to make sure you plugz the connector in the right way
I wouldu have liked some type of label thatn would have identifed it asv a motorola compatiblex device
The cord is a little short but have had no functionality issues
It was exactly what I needed and works as well as oneu that would have cost me 20 or more in the stores
I purchased this battery becuase my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of serviceso it was time
It does last longer and Im glad I bought this battery
I havew no bad reviews about this so if you havem an audiovox 8910a cell phone and you need an replacementthis is the one
It is the standard Palm batteryv meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device
Note also that when using Bluetooth andor the Blackberry Rim emailt service battery lifeh is notably reduced
The solution would be lower device consumption or a bigger capacityp batteryl neither of which appear possible at the moment
It installed very easily with no bother and has functionedb perfectly since the first day
It has far out performed and put to shame the more expensive bulkier unit it replaced
This navigation system is truly a usefulr tool when traveling in areas you are not familiar with
I did a lot of looking beforek purchassing a Krusell and opted to pay a little bit morew fori a product that appeared to be top notch
The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yeti maintains easy use
Cosemetically itf looks great with professionalr attirea or with casual clothingl The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards This is an excellent product
I used to forget my wallet but I always had my blackberry so I bought this then since I take my phone every where butl not my walletg This salved the problem
This is good for people who forget their wallet or phone but rememberh to bring the other
I love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one
It is just nice to have to keep up with one less thing
I highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff
These ared well worth the money for your Nextel Phone Although it may noth list it from Experience these batteries fit 95 of all the Nextel phones
Take a look at yourw phone battery to see ifr its the same shape
The colore will be differenth as these have a white cover
They are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchasedk one in your local Cellular store
Plus these werep NEVER used before Unlike the celluar store battery these batteries come in ay box with the battery in shrink wrap so you know they battery has not been used
When you buy then in the cellular store they are in a plastic boxi that can be opened andb closed and youd neverw know it plus there is noj shrink wrap Ever buyz a battery from a cellular store and have it start noty holding a charge long after only a few months Hmmm I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one Would you knowo
These batteries are well worth it Buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or puta an extra in your car or desk for those long days
thiss charger worksg perfectlyj with my Samsung Blackjack
It is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone
This is a great little desktop charger pocket forh the Motorala V60 and an additionalx battery
However it seems expensive for what you get not to mention the fact that what theu text doesnt tell you is that you need an additional expensive serial cableadapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable
Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time save money and just get the niftyc travel charger with the folding plug for the bargainz price
andf justm place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges
i couldntc believe how small itn is compare to the pictures i saw online
however one bad thing about that is that i lost it already
iy would recommand it to anyone whos thinking about buyingq one
When I lost mya Stylus ia had a difficult time finding au replacement
Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phone models A630 A850 A950 A970 A930 A990 A645 and A870
The thin adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowdedq outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office
I originally bought another Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of thist one
I returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better itd actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer
Its a great product for an great price Delivery was quick too
It fits likep a glove and protectsw the phone while allowing youz to viewr the screen unlike other cases
Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer
allm buttons of the phone are accessible through the case
The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and easilyu remove and reinstall itf onw the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of yourp waistp
You can not access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case
The clear plastic screen that covers the phones screen is a little to far from the surface of the phonesd screen
This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of ther screen
The clear plastic screen protectora may stretch with use and make this easier but Im nota sure
On the positive side you can easily cut outg the clearq plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online
The screen is perfect for text but not for pictures
Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots
I expectedi to use it likel a typical pilot where you write on the screen
Good reception great sound quality Speakerphone is great neats features
The Treo600 has all the functions I needed phone calendar camera etc
1 the screen is not good for viewing pictures but thats what I get for being unwillingx to spend more for a Treo650
2 the phone failed to dial two times in twow months
I had to turn offe theh phone and on again to fix the problem
This is a good thickq screen protector that stays solidly stuck to youro screenv
It has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare but the frostingk is impossiblec to seec when the screen is on
Ive washed mine it comesm out clean as new and thev sticky side stays sticky
Just be very careful not to bend it atb all or stressk it in one place
It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bends it IT WILL NEVER GO BACK
Durable thick doesnt interfere in anye way witho the touch screen
it havent had to wash it yet so I havent triedm out that feature
But I highly recommend its over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these its been totally worth it to mep hey afterj spending hundreds onq your Treo whats a few dollars
theseg javoscreenf Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything youve normally seenm
Typically 95 of the screen protectors are that veryu thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you dont have bubbles butk you almost always dog
When thew screen isw off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screenq is on the bubbles are prettyh invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to makef sure its on there good
This is the state of the art for screen protectors
And this all becomes an even biggerv issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will get dulled and scratched
Because of the thickness and quality of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
I hadp it up and runningk in minutes with my LG VX8600 Verizon
I downloaded BitPM free software to use with the cable
I just followedy the installation instructions that came on the CD that comes with the cable
in clicked one discover phone in BitPM to havef it automatically find the phone
I didnt even needc to go and look for the com port as the installation says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phone
When installing make sure you pick the right driver
if you have XP choose the XP drivere not the NT or Win98 ort other driver
My only complaintk is in the description they dont state the length ofj the cable
My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintainedp constantly
I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire as the usb ports that are connected tod my computer are mounted on my wall
I projected the cable to be about 6 feetz and if you do yourself youre in for a surprise
This cable is only about 3 feet long otherwise everything is fine
The description doesnt state thiso but the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models which really helped me
ont a better note shipping took a meres two days compared to the six days USPS estimated
I have a VX9900 enV and this cable works greatn with it in conjunction withy BitPIM
Not much to say about it really it does what it should
got it a day later basicallyc ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everythingp awesome deal for 3 bucks
Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver amongq all on cd you have to install
No synchronization software is included so you havet to use a thirdparty tool like bitpim
I ordered this cablen on December 1st got it on the 8thv
It came with drivers but I didnt need it because I found drivers online
The cable fit perfectly with my LGVX9900 andl to my surprise it charges too
I recently purchased the blackh metal case for my 8525 and have had a fewm problems witq
First the belt clip isn kind of small and brokel when I tried to clip itz toz my belt
Second the aluminumn case isnt the sturdiest so now its sort ofn bent referring to the hinge I guess Ive beenc really rough on my phone butz I just bend itm back to where its supposed to be referring to the hinge
my phonee looks and performs just as the day I got it
When ia informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip instead I recieved a full refund soh that was a pleasant suprise
I actually likedo it so much I bought my wife one when shec got her phone
The K790a is currently the best Cybershot camera phone in Sony Ericssons lineup but more are oni the way and also handsdown the best camerar phone in the U
Its too bad that SE doesnt sell their 5MP and 6MP cameral phones stateside
But the k790am is very capable as a digitalv camera
Sure its only 3MP but likey many professionals will tell youv pixel counto is only one thing
This 3MP camerainaphone takes betterlooking pictures than 5mpu and 6MP cameras from Vivitar Aptech sp samsungr and other offbrand companies
My main phone is a sanyot M1 withq 2MP and I thought it wast pretty good for a camera phone but when I got thev K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card I was simply blown away by the quality
Of course I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great thingsa about its picture quality but the results stilld far exceeded my high expectations
I dont care for the MMS features because my prepaid service Speak Out Wireless doesnt support them
I justh download them to my pcp using a USB card reader
I wish there were opticall zoom more and more camera phones in Japan including models from Casio now have opticalb zoom but the truth is of course that if you need serious picturetaking you still use a real digital camera
But this comesk real close to replacing your workhorse digicamk
Ill use this for a year and upgrade toa SEs next gen next year hopefully by thenl theyll have releasedp optical zoomequipped K phones
receptionu is pretty good on the tmobiler Cingular networksq used by Speak Out Wireless
Pictures are amazing for a phone MP3 player couldp use a little help
Screen is beautiful and as always menu interface isx a treat
The phone isa Java 2 compliant howeverr many programs that run in the background will not notifye be able to notify you unless the programq is open
Very other than the MP3 player and javao notification issues the phonen is a 5n
purchased the phone about 3 months like the nice qvgao screen and impressed withd excellent cam it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors
the phone has good reception at least on parm withx W810
voice call is OK but asc other users statede the level is kinda lowe esp speakerphone firmware upgrades R1KC001 will helpy
the operation is standardp SE style if youq are familiar youll be OK without reading manual
the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio still used by bbcb and it works well witho TMobile internet itt can play local mp3 VBR supported wma asf audio rename thez extensionz tos
wma realaudio but ip wish it supports ogg vorbis which is the audio format I use
bluetoothg worksu pretty well it works with ALL bt equipment I have including wireless headphones
logitech headphones users please read in orderv to make the headphones works properly you need to go tob bt menu and connect fromn there
web browser can handle regular html sites as well asj simplifiedn html and wap sites
the phone is kinda bulky and al bulge on cam cover but its pretty comfortable and firm to hold making messaging is a good pleasure
though the phone has lot of functionsfeatures arep pretty appealings it lacks something its supposed to have
quadband this isz not acceptableg for this price evenf many lower models have quadband K550 W610 W580 W810 Z710 W710
music player should have more file formatr supportz ogg vorbis streamimg wmaasf shoutcast
m2 memory card though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB PSP card is a lot cheaper
QVGA screen and it showsx clock when the phone is idlea
low earpiece and speakerphone level though firmware upgrade will fix
conclusionz if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam gox for it however if you travel a lot settle with quadband modelsr theyre cheaper
ives had 3 cell phones prior to this one all Motorola and I reallyu thought they were all pretty good phones
However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water Its very compact and durablew you can tell it was madeh with an incredible level of quality control
This iss whyz I bought the phone now I am never without a camera
The flash ise good and strong so it takesi great pictures with good focus
I dont really use the mp3 feature because I have an iPod
However I was VERY disappointeds thatj it wouldnt allow me to use mp3s as ringtones
I heard this was because my service provider is a jackass and not the phones fault though
With a little bit of forum browsing I was able to hack my way around this if you have this problem email me atj skibum2801yahoo
now I have my very own custom ringtones that come out as clear as day withw the nice speaker
I feel as if Im simply using my home phone its so great
The buttons tooka a little bit to get used to because I was a Motorola girl for so long but ih picked ita up quickly and noww I havej no issues
Pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carriern
Super easy tol upload pictures straight toi Flickr viaf phone
This is a topd selling handset in europey but tricky to get hold of in the US which is still relativelyq in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology
Coming from a SonyEricsson T637 I was familiar with the sed UI so getting used to thisi phone was relatively easy for me
in love the camera it takes amazing pictures and the music playerg serves my needs just fine
Support for a memory card is a huge plus I havem a 1 GB Sandisk M2 Micro cardb and now I never have to worry about running outy ofq room for music of photos
This phone also allows for extensive customization in terms of shortcuts and themes ringtones and so forth which is another plus
As far as negatives form the phone I only have a few minor ones the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet and the camera lens cover sometimes slides open in myh pocket but neither of these would convince me not to get this amazing phone its quite possibly the single best phoneb Ive ever owned Definitely very happy with this purchase
Es el mejro celular q pude encontrare tar pasarw 2 meses leyendom Reviews en mil paginas
mpj unq screen def colores hermosos radio videos movies mp3 bluettoth memory card buenos acesesorios incluidosf Es el mejor celular del mercad
edgeq device makess internet datap fairly quick and usable as pcg modem via bluetooth
camera lens cover needs a lock switch mine opens just walking aroundf and takes pictures of the lint inf my pocket very annoying
sleep timer is a bit quick and should be adjustable
I shouldnt expect it thinner since it is the size of a very small digital camera but Id still like it slimmeru
thep xenon flash really helps taking night pictures
I use to own the w800i and this one takes way better pictures
It has autofocus and other several fucntion that i havent used yet
I love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phonea
It also very easy to navigate through the phone functions
myg computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded
The only complains i have about this phone is the headphones
Walkman series have way better headphonesa so when you get this make sure to buy new headphones and adapter
Another complain is the expensive memory stick micros
andt i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned
It has alsob replacedf myr camera and I am now never without a camera
I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited
They dontu give the phone a second glance not realizing its got the 3
I have got tons ofk fantastic shots from thea last 4 shows
After throwingl in ax 1GB memoryh stick I think it was 79 it is now storings a halff gigz of my best music and the display says it will hold 300 pics right nowv
The movie function rocks toom however you ares going to want to be upw very close to the subject
The sound playback of they movies is fantastic though so at least concert videos make for good listening
If I throw itk on the USB cable it pops up instantly as anotherv drive just like the camerai
If I dontl care about viewing the files and just wantb to move stuff onz and offo the phone I dont even take it out of my pocket
thez bluetooth connection allowsn me to usej their software toq move things around
Also very cool was that itt pops upd on my computer as a Modem which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC anywhereg program
The contact list is easy to work with the call clarity is no issue at all good signal no dropped calls etc
It needs charging about every 3rd dayj charges veryf quickly
Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges
The only thing I can think to complaini about is that when using the USB cable to charge it only wants to charge it to 89
If I want 100 I have to throw it on theq real charger for a few minutes
I paid 14 as much for this productv and it works just as well asa the name brandj product
The product wasn delivered in a timely manner and functions properly
The photo ofe this Premiun Side casev is not at the Photo
The side case in the photo havel a Treo logou and the producto dont have i
I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car
The clipj just wouldnt grip my belt securely enough
I gave up after the 3rd time my Treo 650 hit the concrete
Most of thed time I just slip the thing in my left pocket but that doesnt work so well with some pantsw especially jeans
I decided to try the Treo leather case and I like it quite ag bit
The clips is strong and I find it easy to get the phone in andq out of the case
This is the third case I tried for myb Treo 650 and its simplicity is its keyp to success
myd first case had a flapping piece of leather that cost 35 and was totally useless
My second skin had a belt clip that whenever I bent over to tie my shoes forx example the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor Simply bad design
This welly designed Premium Side casec is easy to use easy to wear and gives excellent protection
When the phone isa in vibrate mode you are always aware when you get a call page or email
itsm small enough that its not a problem when worn with a suit and sits in the right place when driving with a seat beltn
Good design is always fashionable and the case isz well made
I used to carry myb Treo 600 with thet originalp case that came with the device
But soon I found out that the originalv case is kind of loose and my Treo fell out from its once
Luckily itv was on aq carpet so no damagez at leastg no visuali damages
After that incident I started looking forx a bettere caseh and this one is what I found
What can I say youu dont know how bulky treow is until you wear onew ony your belt
The case does itsc joby it provide a nice and securem protection for Treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway soz you dont have to carry it around with your hand or inj you pocket which barely fit
But Treo is quite heavy and its thick so you willg definitely aware your Treo is hanging on your belt
And sometime I just feel like its too muchf a burdent andv I want to get it off me
But overall I still prefer to have this than the original case
And the heaviness ish not this cases faultb should blame Handspring nowv PalmOne for not making it lighter
This case is great for protecting my Treo but the downsideb is that I have to remove it from theh case to use it
iq purchased it because I had actually dropped myf Treo when walking withf it balancedg on my portfolio now I clip it to the portfolio and it is secure and safe and I dont run the risk of leaving it behindt
Dont waste your time looking for another case this is the best
How come phone accessoriesi dont qualify forx prime shippingu How are theym different from other electronics
The only negative comment that ij willp make about the casen is that occasionally theu memory card gets ejected when taking the phonem outk of the cases due to the snug fit
Amazon has the beste price for the case and it is well worth the price
The fitc is snug and secure enough not tof fall offj and get lost
thet silicone protective covering for the Treo wasv exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fitsa my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had anotherf brand prior to thatz
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leatherv cases etc
But the thickness gains youn considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete severalg times and nary a scratchw
I like the design of thist unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easye to press
The protectives skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do whatf is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantagen is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was customq formed for every curve bump and button on the treop
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatiblez with them 700w and 700p
I shouldr have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almostn identical except for the buttons just below the screen
thes button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button coversu for the 700w not the 700pl
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
Driver install was easy and Bitpim access works just fine
The cable I receivedt also charges then phone VX8300 from Verizon
in agree with previous reviewers Gely zencityk regardingk this cable
The pricep wasq right set up was easy and with the Bitpim program you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently
I loaded my whole Outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones
Dont waste your money buyingz and downloading ringtones orl music from Verizons sitesb vcastx and suchx just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the musictones that you already own
You will likely need some type of additional software to actually DO anything with the phone
I ordered this cable two of them actually to use on thex LG 8300
thea driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300a
I used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phone
I was unable to locate a data cable locallyc and was happy tou find one on Amazon evenf though it was only available through a third party
All in all I recommend the productb to those in need ofv cables for the LG 8300
For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 pleasey be aware there appears to be no driver included for your phone
howeverd ip already had a driver that I knew worked so ik did not use the discf
Product is excellent and does all it is supposed to do
I was very pleased when I got thisf cell phone case
I was really frustrateda with myn phone before purchasing this caseb
I kept on getting the screens dirty every time I made a call
It feels good it has kind of a rubber feeln and the insidex is clothh
itr protects my phone io have two boys andl while they are supposed to not touch dads phone it has an almost 100 chance of getting dropped sooner or later
Like the other guy mentioned theu clear plastic covers the camera ay little but not a big deal camera is not so hot anyhowg
it have no buyersw remorse andf after surveying the options for the v710 I still think thisp is the best
The rubber suit covers every bit of the phone sop I am confident that I wont bex getting any scratched
youd can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched
There is a strap that goes over the topt so your v710 definitely isnt going to fall out
3 minor qualms The see through plastic has a little glare on it especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suitw
Also it adds just enough weight that iti flips open with a little knock
noticed this most when having the phoneu horizontallyd mountedi on my belt
Last the flap sort of comes into the field of viewo of thes camera
You already know the v710s camera is craps for itst specs but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap
I just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice
It feels solid ands professionally made not some cheap import special
I like the blue LED light instead ofe the typical red dot
Also the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out ofk the way when you have the phone down just charging
The IC chip is important so that you dont overcharge your phone battery and shorten its life
The only problem is that it can only hold the standard batteryg so your out ofm luck if youre using the extended battery for your A920 phone
Other than that its a very nice and stylish case for the Samsung a920e phone
top part of telephone gets loose veryb often elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily
I have a 6255i phoneb and usedy the cable to connect to ac windows XP home system
Installation was seemless and the drivers from XP worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately
Downloaded the Nokie suite software from the Nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine
Cellphone companies wanteds 50t bucks for the same cable
Use this one you will save money and its the same cable
The cable came faster than expected I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow
The cable came with thek software driver although I did not need it and worked great with my already installeds Nokia Sync software
Electro Island had the best price by far and then service was excellent
The silicone protective coveringt for the Treo was exactly whatp I wanted and just what I expectedv it to be
It fits my treou 650i perfectly and I couldntt be happier
il have used this productf for about four months andw had anothern brandx prior to that
As others haves noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerablel protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times andq nary a scratch
I like the design of thisr unit as it leaves the keyboard exposeds and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designedb to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage isa that you can not keep it on whenb putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and button onu the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise itw as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I shoulde havej paid more attention to thev pictures and thoughtk about it
The 700w and p if yout dont know are almost identical except for thef buttons just below the screenp
The button layout isv the samea but they different icons and purposes
Well thet skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
Bluetooth can not be accessed when the phone is in the pouch
I was so easy and fast to order and the person I bought it from seemed to make itz easier
I have had no problems with charger and amb very happy with myb purchase
iq dont need to buy stuffk online when now I can download ita straight to myv PC
makesd it easy to transferf Pictures videos ring tones contact numbers
My original charger broke that caome wit ther cell phone
I was going to go buy a charger but they cost like 30 if youb get the name brand
This one I purchased does the tricko and saved me lots of money
I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacement for thec name brand chargerp I gotv with the phone
While it does charge I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98
I am unsure however if this is because my batteryd is less effective than when new
This holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with the phone
It has a lowerd profileb which means it sits closero tol youra belt
It is also isu much easier to actuate than the stock holster
The thumb tab is oriented in just the right directionk for easyb inout
thise item costb 1 penny of course the shipping was 4
84 bute in thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holstersx cost in the stores
Ive had it for two weeks and it hasnt broken yet nor has it dropped theb phone accidentally
Order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters
thist belt clip was exactly what I was looking for and the price was greato
If I could change one thing the swivel actionn is just a little looser than I would like but definatly not a problem
Ive had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now and I just loveo it ib am very new to ally this fancy cell phonel stuff the last one I had was barec bones basic
It is greatk having a phone that you canh do so much with
The cameral is so handy since I neverk remember to take my other camera anywhere with me and the mp3 player and radio are also great to have
theq music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadnt made up my mind until I sawd this phone and what an awesome deal it was
You just cant beat a one cent phone with free shipping and 75
00 in rebates TMobile had my old Net10 phone number ported to the new phone in 2 days The customer service people have been so nicem and the ability tow buy ringtones wall paper and myfaves icons right on thep phone from tzonesh isw awesome
ia also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account plan info right on the phone
thek onlyi issuef I have been having is finding accessories forr itmy usual discount accessory shops dont have much yetIm assuming because the phone is so newj but Im sure that will get resolved soon
yes its a tie witht the Sony Cybershot K790a for the best multimediav phone so far on the market at least until the iPhone will show up thenj the game is on again
i am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile contractu for 2 more yearsc and get this phonek for 100 or drop my previous one ando getf a new contract
For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travelo charger you get a travel charger home charger and a USB cable with driver CD
The instructions forw the USB cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use windowsw Media Player to move musick over to your phone using the Sync feature and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file transfers between yourx PC and phone
somee of thef reviews saids that both chargers worked fine but they were unable to get the data cable to worke
However I found no such problems and successfully used thes data cable to transfer files off of my phonei
After installingh the drivers just search the web for a program called BitPim
Its not exactly then nicest looking software but gets the jobt done
iw got the a data transfer cableq the house and carh charge cheaper than what I would have paid for the car charger alone
I have been usingt this piece fork the last one year and its quite a decent one
It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed
An amplee speaker phone and wonderful camr can come handy at times
I recently had a problem with handset regarding theq voice andc this is immediately replaced by T mobile
If youx want a cell phone that is well made looks good feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things thex V360 is an excellent choice
It has enough featuresa to keepl things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality ora battery lifex to a bunch of useless features that I dont want
it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use
I bought my V360 on eBay andf itl was sold unlockedunbrandedd and it was ofm the quadband variety
Durability this thing was built with the clumsy in mind like me
I must have dropped this thing a dozen times and theres barely a scratch
MP3 player I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke bute with the cost of TranshFlash memory coming down id bought my 512MB chip on eBay for 7d
That being said the MP3 playero is a feature you will actually USE andr the sound quality is good
Ive had no problem withi playingg my iTunes music as long ask theyre mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality thenc it will play fine
Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats you need tom convert themd to mp3 ork change the default in eithero program ton rip to mp3 format you canl change the default tod mp3 in the settings menu
Programmable smart keys I readr where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side it was the camera icon buttonw onf thep fronta keypad
He must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the Personalize menu
Not only that but you can rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps
You mayi notf use these features outofthe box but theyre for the time when these technologiesc are more commonplace
I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and foro syncing andv adding files mp3s pics etcm to my phone with my laptop
This phone works one 850 900 1800 and 1900 GSM networks althoughy that has not been personally tested
However I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK withinu the year and Ill know for certain by thenz
Theres a slight delay when you answerg a call I usually have tow say hellon 23 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak
I dont know if this isk a carrier problem or the phone
The light stays on while charging even when the phone is powered off
You really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone
It has a monochromev outer display full color inside
thisz doesnt bother me at all but its not as flashyz as Razr or other phonesm
This is a greati durable little phone with handym features I think people will actually use
Ive read where people complain about the picture quality but thats what a digital camera is for
If you wanti a good quality cell phone thats well designed user friendly and doesnt look like a trickedout teenagers phone then this is the phone for you
As usual Motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but thisi isx not all its more than free you get 50 bucks outa of this deal
Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the timef to the readl the manual
My biggest complaint thatp hask nota yetg been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can onlyy hold 30 text messages in itsn memory
Despite having something like five Meg ofl memory on the phone and a Micro SD memory card thats it
The size of the text message doesnt seem toa matterb
This is a great phone that ivem used forn a year now
Id like to highlight the standout features that make this phone unique especially at its price
Just get an adapter for the usb port ar few bucks on eBay and you can plug in your stereo headphones
Too bad they haventf offered an update to the Motorola digitalh Audio Player
You can take a MicroSD card put it into the included adapter and plug into an SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s you can take any mp3b and make itn yourc ringtonex cropping it will makel it more effective 3gpr videos animation looks great but the sound was slightly out ofg sync search the webt for video converters to convert your content or pictures
I love making my own ringtones and not having tog buy them
I got an Explorer 320 headset for 20 and it workse great with it
Easily slide off the cover and popp in a fresh one
The batterys life isnt verya longq so its good to have a spare battery theyre cheap
Not highz quality video butj its something the old RAZR couldnt do
You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the top of the keypad and the directional pad tor go directly to most functions of the phone
It even has a shortcutb list to list all your favorite features
yout can easily make any picture including pics you takeu into your wallpaper
alsor youn can find replacement faceplates to make your phoneh unique
Good for using automated phone menu systems and when youre puta on hold
The speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s
The plastic may resonate at certain sounds though
VIBE THEN RING Why doesnt everyz phone have this itc should be the default standard for all phonesq
The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket
If you are one to showq off your ringtone let it move onto ring otherwise be descreet and answer immediately

All thew lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off
I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has agedb a bit
ia scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldnt look half worn offl

All the great features is what keeps me from getting an Samsung t509 or other morez expensive phones
This phone just hasc all the feefree features you could want
if the cell is in my back pocket jean the blutetootho set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up
I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headset and find it more than adequate
thes ability of using AAA batteries puts it abovei all other headsets in that respect
Nonreplacable rechargable batteries areg a gimmick
So you throw your headset andd charger away and buy a new one
Depending on your ear structure the fitj can be either formfitting or looseu
From reading the other reviews here one canu infer this
Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephonet or device it pairs to would make a difference in performance
Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowedl some static
For me andl others we experienced nom such problem
bestt bett is to check the return policy if you find that it doesnt meet your standards
But if itz worksm for your device youw have a headset that goesz 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talkh time on 1 aaao alkalineu battery
andi you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea
If it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner
I can use it daily for an hour or so every day on a single AAA for at least two weeks
It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot
I use thisv headset with both a Treo 650 phone and a Apple PowerBook G4
On the Apple I canf use it as a generic output device
The signalr is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30p feet away on the Treo 650 thew signal is not nearly as good
like driving or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing fullblastj OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudlyy thenh its sometimes hard to hear
the call goes back to my cell phonet when the battery is getting low
You can milk it a whiley longer but thats really your first clue aboutq the battery
The earpiecef is OK itsq not as secure as Id hope
If youre outsideu ine a gust you mayc want tok hang on to it
Also people on the other end sometimes can tell Im on a headset with this one they mention that I sound a little staticky
This is myb first bluetooth headset so perhaps my rating is higher just because its a nifty gadget
But the batteryp life on this is really the winner myu workmates have rechargeable headsets and it seems like theyre alwaysk having to charge them
I use rechargeable NiMH AAAs and they just last a really long time with this unit
I bought this headset for internet chats with myf husband when he travels for business
The sound quality is good volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo
I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a charger
All you needx isa a spareq battery and no worries about the device dying whena the internal battery dies
The ear wrap is comfortable and staysd securely on my ear
It wouldd be nice if it bent for a customd fitd but I am pretty happy with it
Easy to pair with my phone Motorola SLVR L7 European Version
Have not had a complaint about echoes as otheri reviews stated
Price affordable but acts like an expensive headset
22 Hours of talk timea before battery has to bek replaced
I would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hated to recharge their headset
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best
There is nox finer quality andk the selection of products is welld above the restb
Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price
ito works beautifully with my Treo 700p smartphone
I love the retractablei cablen that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button making the whole unit quick and easy to store
The only complaintf Ive heard is that the large blue power lightd is too bright at night
It doesnt annoy me but myl wife asks me tob turn the device sideways or upsidei down so the blue glow doesnt shine up into herx eyes
thed retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone
My complaint with allg Palm chargers is that thew weak point is at the connector and they breakq
But the price on thisu one is good enough that you shouldg buy 2
This is an excellentk product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hidingy its stylek
I chose Treo because of its unique lookt and excellent features howeverz the case from palmx didnt work for me because I use the phone ac lot and I dont have time to put the phone backc in the case everytime
So it gets throwni in my purse along withi other items which then scratch it
I also bought a bodyp Glove case andh while I can use the phone while in it it hides the Treos real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag
I loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands anyone who arek crazy over that colorf
had a return andu theyy replaced it no questions asked
Good battery life certainly much better than the old one it replaced
For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original
However it doesnty fit quite as snuglyu in the dockstyle charger that cameu with my phone not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on yourf desk and contacts the battery directly
That ise a littlex annoying that it tends to fall out if imh not paying attention Ill wake up the next morning and my phone wont actuallyk have been charged but it still works
This battery saved me from renewing the contractthus the battery was a contract killer
I thought I was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49
The product is probably a decent product but it doesnt work in my vehicle 04s Jetta
I think it has to do with the part you plug into theb cigarrette lighter being to long
Item arrived quicklyj and was exactly as advertised charges the phone ino about 15 minutese of drivingk
I couldnt believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price
Everything is still workingb well i am very happy with my purchase
The cable is exactly what I needed and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives
Drivers provided on thej accompanying CD worked but were not as complete asn I would have liked
I am stilla very satisfied as it was only the cable that I was really after especially fors the price at which I bought it
The vehicle phone charger I received was not the one pictured as for sale
It does however appear to be equal in features
I have now used this product and find that it does notg work to charge my V170 cell phone
ib have since purchased the Motorola charger morea expensive and it works perfectly
thisb carf charger does what it isz spposed to do and the pricef isd right
You might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind
I amq alwaysz willing to wait a little longer and pay ai little more if it know what I am getting is notu just a counterfeit
After reading reviews herer user forums iu decided to purchase thisf
It can charge a secondaryx batterym in the rear compartment AND can charge
the extended life batteries as welld whileb the Q is on the charger
The three color LED indicator ish added benefit wa simple guide
The charger can not overcharge the batterys which is an added benefit
And you can easily access the qj while on the charger for SMS texts using any app
or even usingf the speaker phone while on the desktop charger
Motorola should includeg this with each Motorola Q phone asr standard equipment
Great product works quickly when charging my Moto V555 in the car
I simply wanted a data cable to connect my verizonn cell phone to my Macintosh so I could transfer and synchronize data
Verizon was of no helpg and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on Windows machines
This was a WHOLE lote cheaper than the Verizon dealer wanted for this productz
My onlyt disappointment was that it didnt have clear instructions which was LGs fault
covery fitss great and for the price i couldq not find anything better was at the locala mall and saw a cover that was the same for around 17
I just bought this case a few weeks agor and its holding up very well
Well I hope this thing will last for many monthsr down the tough road
I would likeh to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose fromg wich colors are there this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee
the case looks great and it is very slim fitting so the phone doesnt look bulk
This was delivered as an OEM product exactly as expected
I bought onef of these extended batteries on ebay and was really sorry
I wasa reluctant to try again but I was glad I did
thisl time I got a good quality battery and it holds ac charge atq least twice as long asa my old batteryl
I only have to charge the new battery every 2 3 days
I have triedz a dozenn screen guards some of them shine a lot some of theme are not as clear as they promise some taket like 2w hrs to stick onl the screenw without any air bubble
And yea the best part is itsn statica not gume and its washable
The touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice
The onwly reason i didnt give it a fiveu is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuckk on the adhesive backing and itx is very difficult toa remove so be very careful not to aloowa any foreignc objectsg to attach themselves while cleaningr your screen easier sad than done
ifi anything does attachi it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protectoru muchg but it leavesq slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer
I have had it for some time now I got it for my 11th birthday
I have reviewed the cingularw version too even though mines verizon
Very short battery life iq have to charge it almost every day
Camera The picture you takex cant move or it comesf out all messed up
Recording videos Even though you get 15 seconds ib stillt useb that to make funny videos with my friends
Its style I love thee color andr styley myg friends are all jealous
Personally I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its functionality you are buying the wrong phone
I have personallys owned numeroush lgo phones and while they may notn be as small light and attractive as Motorola phones LG phones are built to last
However if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carry in your pursepocket and toz use justb as a nice looking phone this is a great one to own
I previously had the LG vx9800h before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c
I had the VX9800 because when I wasu in college I would texta people constantly and use the AIM feature duringl boring classese
howeverx now that I am in the working worldz and basically only use my phone to call peoplec I wanted a phone that was easier to carry around and was cute
I dont recommend this phone if yours phone is your lifeit doesnt do much
However if youh are just going to be using it to make calls and send the occasional text its wonderful
The pink color that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeousits almost a purpleypinkish lavendar color
In my opinion this pink is prettier than the TMobile magentag and much mucho muchh nicer than the Cingular pink I amn not a fan of thate one at all
In essence if yourez looking for a hightech phone this is not it
If youre looking for a lightweight attractive phone justp ton use for calls and some texting this is a greate buy
I just got my pink razr phone and I love it so far
iu love that it is pink and it is diffrenty from the other pink phones
Even though it does not have anc antenna on theq outside thatv you can see it still it works well
I was scaredo to buyl this phone because I read some of the reviews and some of them werent saying good things about the phone but I think that they werey wrong aboutl it
When I firstf got my Motorola Q I was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying batteryo in mid day
With some setting changes and the 1700 mAh battery that isp now far in the past
A little fattere than the regular battery which means a very tight squeeze in my Qholder but the extra power makes az big difference
I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protector only but also a squeegeem clothe and cleaningh instructions
This shield fits very nicely overn myc phone screen
My friend from HK just got this phone andq ask me to buy her an Eforcity screen protectoru
Hes been know toz show it off and got hisr hold phones all scratched up
itsy a good phone and he uses as an mp3o player but I digress
The screen protect worksd as described it comesl with a polishv cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator
The film has some kind of electrostatic polymer theres no adhesive but once you peel off both sides itf seals right on to them screen
Squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed
It definitely improves the grip onk the Blackberry especially when Im using itd as a phonex
It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse
My two problemsr are that I wish there wast more variety in the colors available similarm to the Speck Ipod protective cases
Come on guys Women useh these items too Also the rubber strip between thed screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that Ive had this case
Other than those two things this isq a great not bulky casep
it is small and compact easyr fori travel but also good for home use
I am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone
I would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for aa work phone that is easy to carry and get to whene needed
I use my belt holster with all the phones ive owned my i530k isq no
This belt holster feels really well made it has a strongn belt clip which is good for how hard I use it
A big plus is that I canq usev my phoneg while its in the holsterb
works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate andl can be used to adaptk your lg phone to what ever you wanz
An extra lithiuma battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone
The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you alwayso have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts
I have found them 750 mahh Lithium Ion Battery to bep dependablez nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging
ite doesnt weakin as didi my i1000 battery when charging startedg at mid range
However the first time you charge or rechargey your lithiumk battery is the most important charge ofr all
You mustj let thej initial or first chatge rune out completey before begining to recharge the battery
The deader the battery on its firstd run the better the life of the battery and standby time for chargesy to come
I am in northern Ohio and travel many places around the state
No matter where I have gone and I take my phoneb everywhereo with me I have yet to find a place where my phone doesntr have Nextel servicej
iu live on am farm here and we use the twoway often to communicate
My phonek ine particular has been dropped several times once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below and once alsoh driven over bym four wheeler inp mud
I am extremely happy with Nextels service and phonesr
I know several other peoplec with different model Nextel phones and also cant complain
I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon Alltel Cingular and Sprint
Its a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged from my experience with Sprint they are terrible with no service anywhere and their phones suck too
iv have used the i530 for a little over two years andr have had no problems with the unit or withn NEXTELs service
To simplify your reading here is a list of pros and cons
Cons A little chunky lacksr upn top date features and tech such as color screen external displayq etc
pross Durability beenr dropped off a roofs still going strong Looks yellow model Call quality is excellent Good speakerphone Digital 2way is a greath featuree
The only issue among the cons that is of anyj real concernr is the battery life buti this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones perhaps due to the nature ofh the idenb network on which they operate
Even after two years my originala battery lasts more than a dayr with moderate use
A pain Slightly but given the advantages ofr NEXTEL its worth remembering to charge up more often
Please bewarel of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below my experience with their coverage customer service etcl
Just make sure you do your homework with respect tot coverage before you sign up witht any wireless company
Go with the one that gives the best coverage inx the areas in which you live work or travel
Its always best to actually put the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone
NEXTELs maps are prettys legit at least as farw as I have discoveredj
For two years now I have noty had any problems with my Motorola i530 cell phone which is serviced by TelusNextel
Over all I would rate the serviceh as good not excellentb
Rarely I will have trouble getting service in a area where I would normally get a strong signal
This problemf will normally last for roughly under a minute before myn phone is once again operational
Im a daily commuter between Canada and the United States
My phone doesnt miss a beat it will automatically switch fromf Telus a Canadian server to Nextel anq American server and still have the same great reception
The celli phone itself is big bulky heavy andb ugly
It doesq not come equipped with any of the cool picture or video features
It doesn have a direct connect feature so you can use your phone like a walkytalky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone
thep reception on the phone is clearn and crisp itn will seldom cut out of the conversation
Therefore I did notl expect the quality of the sound ofw down loaded music toq be so poor
ir have thrown my phone acrosso a room to ad friend who failedh to catch it more then once
One of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces
On a road trip my phone had fallen off myu lap out of the car and sat onc the side of the road for threev days in the rain
I had recharged the phone and iti worked as expected
My phone has never let me down I have always gotten service and the battery hase not died on me thus far
The battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low toc moderate usage
If you are looking for a quality phonew builtk to with stand punishmenti and do not desire all of those new phonep gimmicks this phone is for you
i haveg this nextel it works verry goodf im verry happy with it
What can I say It works very well I keep thisc in my car so when I travel I dont have to worry about my Palm TXs batteriess
This is the 5th Palm treo case ij have bought in the last few years andz it is the best by far
It holdsn the treor snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap
The clip is metal unlikeg many of thef crappya plastic ones that break alot
I was just lookingd for a simple belt carrier that would protect my Treo 700p but would allow complete access to the Treo whenm is wanted to usex it
In other words I didnt want something that was attached to the treod permanently
There is one complaint sometimes the persont you call sounds like they are drunk
I have the i850 but the i560 is what my wife has been using for about 3 months
theq phone is so good myl 2 year old cant destroy it hes tried theresz only 3 thingsy I dont like about it it doesnt have a very bigw screen the external screen isnt color and it hasl no camera
Other than that its pretty much the same as the higher priced modelsc like the i850
and holding them together I suspect that they in fact have the samec electronics inside minus the 3 thingsi I mentioned abovef
If you dont take pics this really isr the phone for you You can even submerge this thing in water and it will still work without needing anything special It has GPS built in and all the java apps
Its everything the higher priced models have minus the camera and a smaller screen
Even though the screen is smaller its color and very legible
The Motorola i560 is nicely sized easy ton use and indestructible
These featuresr arel whatm to look for when looking for a new cell phone
Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones such as the i710 but it is the unbreakable model with outside display
Size isa important especially with Nextel because most of their early models are very big and awkward like the i710
thee i560 is perfectly in between massive and tiny
This is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens andm antennasn
It is equipped with gripping as well whichk helps when it comes to using the direct connect placing calls and receiving calls
itk is nice looking but is harder to keepa in your hand
More damage is done toa the i710 because there is no gripping
If however the i560 does slip out of your hands dont worry
Dropping this phonei is not ar concern due to extreme durability
If you are worried about scratching the outside get a leather or plastic cover for it
they easeu ofw use between the i560 and the i710 is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicity however the big differenceu is in the outside display on the i560
Without even opening the phone you can place a call by pushing the stop butt atx the top of the phone and scroll through your most recent calls
The i710 speaker phone cuts outu every third word where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspect but an improvement is better than nothing
There is nothing worse than having to takej a cell phone in fors repair or even worse having toj replace ita
ast much use as mostj people get out of their cell phones how it stands up to daily wearq and tear is vital to satisfaction with a phone
The i560 isb one of the unbreakable models from Nextel and is exceptionally tough
When the i710 is dropped it often goeso to a blank screenq and causes problems with reception and service
Overall performancer mass and resilience ofk the i560 surpasses thec i710
mym previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with Cingular so I am still gettingu usede to all the differences in phonew capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 cana do
Heres a breakdown of thea pros and cons so far after a week
Nextels Direct connectc is amazingly fast and theirh network very clear
Any call either DirectConnect or regular call can be made with thec flip open or closedv
You can scroll through recent callsd with the flipe closeda and call anyj of them
If youre concerned aboutg radio RF radiation and you shouldw be even thougho nobody talks about it anymore this phone has the extendable antennao tou get the transmission point further away fromb you and improves the transmission
The speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be even at dinning roomo table with the TV on and them sound patchedf through the stereo system very impressive
There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone full duplex
You can also turn its volumeq down to a whisper if you want to
The phone is ad little wider than some phones like the V60 but is very light
Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortableh feel inv my mediumsized hand
Phone has slight hourglass shape wider at the bottom to fit nicely into the hand
Phone has all theb standard stuff I loves and couldnt live withouty voice dialingh custom rings for calls from my contact list handsfree long recent calls list up to 20o ability to store number to Contacts from recent callsl without havingl to key the number just have to enter theq name
The phone is almost completely made of plastici and Ive never thought plastic was as durable as metal
While Motorola makes truly awesome phones in worry there might ben an overreliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone
When the phone is in the holster the outside display is notm visible forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see whos calling for those that dont have a custom ring configured or to check the time
Very annoying as Im used to using my phone as a watch
The icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeingc and interpreting the icons
The onlyx two parts that are clear the battery important and datetime
The flimsy port cover at bottom ofo the phone whered you connect the charger etc make me think that someday Im going to look down there and find it missing
Its easyn enoughw to pop off but sometimes takes persuading to puto back and have it cover the slot completely because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec
overallw I really like the phone andg highly recommend it to all
The cover design is well made based on the requirements
The problem according to me is thea device not be able to avoid the dust onc the LCD screen becausee of the openingsf on both the sides
In myd opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allown you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the casef
Im a heavy user ofm GPS applicationsq and Power Vision for websurfing on the go
I used to charge the phonep twice a day now I charge it once af day and sometimes I even forget tob plug it in at night andf I stillw have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day
Even when i forget too charge it hasnt died on me
This battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone
Talk time andm internet time are increased greatlya
ip gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast
Though that is still better than the original battery
I have no idea ifw it is as good as the one sprinty sells for 60 dollars
I just bought this battery at a Sprint Customer Service store and if paid 64
Im going to returni it today and buy it online here
Going fromw charging my phoneh a couple times au day to charging it once every coupleo days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900 making it less highmaintenance and allowing me to do some web browsinge headset using and general multimediaa mayhem without the constant paranoidq fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time
Quite a cheap price fort the freedom andl peace of mindn
Its been 12v hours and the thing has yet tow change from 3 bars
What Aside from the piddling cost of thisv battery which is aboutg double the tax youd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership there is the tax of the bulge itw creates on its backside
To me this is not insignificant but is ignorablej as it doesnt detract fromp the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing talking or using the buttons
The only complaint I had about my a900 was the battery lifef
I am on conference calls a lotd andq use myl bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly
withj this extended battery I am able to usex my headsetm withouty havingz to charge the phone repeatedly
Totally worth the 15 plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping
The Samsung A900 is a great phone a Motorola Razr on steroids
BUT THE batterys LIFE IS AWFUL You literallyn have to charge this phonei at least two times per day too getx any real talk time
NOT ANY MORE The Bargaincell price was so low I was skeptical
PERISH THE THOUGHT I got the battery on time it was VERY well packaged
It fit the phone PERFECTLY as did the COVER it came with
I then used the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge WHOO HOO BRAVO BARGAINCELL
BY THE WAY Even though this is a somewhat thick battery it is SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE It doesx NOT add the bulk you mightg think looking at its pictureo
In fact id think the phone actually looks BETTER with the larger battery
I have aa leather Bytech carry case designed for the RazrA900
Its a tight fit now but Im sure thef case will stretch much like a new shoed does after its been worn a few days
The onlyk bad thing about it I encountered is theg horrid battery life
And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint
nobodyf wants to charge their phone between 24t times a dayl
withw the standard batteryz in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times
So of course I searchedu and finally found this battery whichr was crucial
Be sure toi get this one because it was the cheapest I found andv ih did extensive searching
alsoc this one comes with thef doork which is very crucialw
Ive seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door
You wouldg be screwed without aa door that fits the extended battery
What would you do put aj rubber band around it Heck no
Well anyway now that iy have this battery my phone willm last all day without worries ofh dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries
My A900 is still very thin evenx with this extended battery that sticks out a littlez
Dont worry youre phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all its features without dying
I initially hado thei same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained aboutuntil I applied the FIX Palm has identified that the Treo 680 device can experience reduced battery life when theg camera is usedj
The camera may continue to draw power from the batterys when the device is in standby mode
680 users shouldj install the Treo 680 Camera Update to address this issue
I have gonej through several smartphones in them past 4 months Including Cingular htcb 8125 and Nokia E62 and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned
The palmx operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system albeit less powerful and much more customizable andt synchronizationfriendly than the Symbian OS
Very customizable interface making the phone very user friendly
You can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button
Palm OS is easy to use and thusf youh actuallym get to take advantage of the many features of the phone unlike Windows Mobile which isz definantly more powerful than Palm OS but cumbersomev and difficult to use at times
very important for people like me who like to drive and textemail
Perfect size weight and feel of theq phone in your hand and on your earh
The lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement
Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop
Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you which is very useful although limitsn batteryh life
Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones
I have to charge my phone everyh nightj and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet 30 minutes of mp3 player autoretrieve email every 30 min and 2 hour talkg time ast well as some other Palm functions
If you have iti set on autoretrieve for your email the battery life seemsg to decrease impressively
The newerd manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparentlyp
You cant plug in your own headsets into the devicec like your iPod headphonesc youz have to use a specifics headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm
I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm instead of from Cingular
I got it for 350 with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included
Also if you get it from cingularl they always ruin theu look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone
OVERALL extremely satisfied with this easy to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter battery life
I had a Palm TX which I loved but didnt like having to go to WiFi sites for the web
I also had a Moto V557 phone which is the best cell phone Ive ever owned
I purchased the Treo for thep best of both worlds
I like the Treo 680 buth I had to read all of the instructions call customer service andz practice usinga certain features to not be frustrated withk the phone
For example I had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen andn hadi to practice pressing the small send button
Which I usually missed while in a rush to answer the phone
I like the web because its fast enough that I dont miss the WiFi
I had to get used to the fact that many web sitesb arent small enough for the phonef but its excellent forn using googlee maps looking up business and giving the numberv for easy dialz just tap the blue line checking bank accounts online orders movies weather and especially the newsq
ih absolutely lovef the chat setting on the messagingo
People typically tell me that they cant hear me so I nowi use a corded ear budg
The Bluetooth doesnt work with the voicer dial featured that is purchased separately
You cant insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions
There is no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial az number
You have to leave the phone dialing page and return to redial
The phone dials slowly if there are other programs runningg
And lastly you cant check yourn calendar ori other features after answering they phone if thez key pad was locked when you answered thea phone
You have to hang up withk the person unlock the phone check the calendar and call them back
The battery lifem is poor but I keep a charger in the car which helps ap great deal
I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommenda
They are Launcher Xexcellent mobila Write Treo Voice Dialing The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus Scrabble andz Mars Needs Cows
I also recommend thatt you keep you Treo locked with a securityp password
I have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this 400 phone
It had more memory than my currentk Treo 650c however only after onex day I noticed the batteryb life was draining much fastery than I had anticipated
From myo research I discovered a few things thatj needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours
1ij had to apply ap camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th
2 I needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours
oncef I did these two thingsy my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge andg Ive set my versamail to retrieve messages whenx theyl arrive
This is a big plus for me going from gettingl emails every hour to getting themt when they arrive
Ive had no problems with any of my SD cards or miniSD cards
The increase internal memory also helps sincez I use my TomTom navigation withc my Treo
Ive heard the variousf complaints but you have tot work through somed of them
Upgrading from the treoz 650 it is true thate there isnt much new
Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and nonmegapixel camera leave one frustrated
But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market particularly ifq you want goodo pdao functionalityl or are a PalmOS devotee
sox I accept theg current Palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries
That doesnt meand that I wont tell palmz Guys get your actj together and come out withb something far better
I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didnt want tog look like a dork with some giant blinkingh contraption sticking out of my ear
I took a chancey on this headset even though I read a review saying that it didnt sync up wellq with the vx8300g
Even though it is smallabout 112 theb buttons are stille large enough to use with ease
itj also fits snug and comfortabe in myp earg and works well with my VX8300
the headset is great works really well with my samsung phone
the only problem i have with itd is sometimes itsj hard to make it stay in my ear but itsv really great and i would buy itc agai
Well I read through just about every review priorf to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twicey about it after reading some of the reviews here but I decided to take the plunge and go for it
All I can sayr is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the getgo
It has its flaws butn what phone doesnt The question is whether youre going go flipx out over an alarmw clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for youj
Most of the gripes others have had justq seem little to mew
My area has good Tmobile coveragey so I cant complain
It also pairs with my bluetooth headset Plantronics 510 really well
99 plan and yes EDGE isnt the fastest but it gets the job donea
It doesnt matter where Im at I can check my email findsx restaurants or directions or just surfs the web when Im bored
It really came in handy when I was outl on vacation anda lost
Didnt want toe fork out the money forf hotspots though
No its not going tob replace my regular camera butw I found it really handy when I forgot tom takew my camera to my friends wedding but was still able to take quality pictures
Mp3Video player Now the speakers on this phone arent the greatest so I wouldnt use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headset it sounds pretty good
I bought a 2GB microSD card bought here at Amazon and now I can hold an ton music and movies
thisz thingm is my travelinige entertainmentm center
I even found a wayn to play original nintendo games on thisd thing and have been trying mikex Tysons punchoutf like back in the old days
Calendarschedule I had a PDA butq for some reason Im morer compelled to actually use my calendaru and keep my schedule ong thisi thing than I did with my pockets pcf
Smartphone applications Im in the medical field and I keepn all my medical applications on this phone
I can quickly look up drug references or research diseases
I really thought Id need a touchscreen in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus im dont find that its all that necessary and still navigate pretty well
I just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps but its more than adequate
And Im not sure why people dont think there are a lot of programs for the smartphone
Programs written for WM5 are compatable with PPC ase well as smartphones equally
Appearance Everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do I
I saw this side by side withj the Motorola Q and the Q just looked so much bulkier and
Battery fora all that I use this phone for it makesc it through the day with plenty battery to spare which is all I can really ask for
I wouldnt go 2 days without charging the battery though
Windows Mobile 5o Mighty Microsoft needs to write at cleanert program
However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will be free toh download for TMobile customer soon so hopefully thatll take care of some of thee problems
I swear just to turn on the bluetooth andv pair up my bluetooth device takes me a wholep minute just because of hows hardi it isy to navigate WM5
Adjusting the volumer with this thing is tedious at best
luckilye my musicvideoo programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume so its nots such an issue for me
Alarm clock Now I dont use this all that much but I see what everyone says about it and yeah its a pretty idiotic written program
However rather than writing half a page on how bads it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so myv lifen now goes on
Summary So I use this device to make quality phone calls surf the web check email play games listen to music watch movies monitor my schedule check myr medical references and take decent quality pictures
All this thingz needs now is a laser beam that willw cut through metal and itdc be the greatest gadget knowns to man
When I got this phone I gavez my PDA to my brother and my Razr to my daughter
I love the full contact list withm addresses all the phone numbers and notes that are in my Outlook and it syncs with Outlook
The calendar is really nice and that too syncs with Outlook
I dont tryl to use it for browsing the internet buto I do use Tmobiles tzonese to collect all my email from all my various email address types
It took some learning tov find the easiest wayp to get to everything butm its there is you look called and received numbers with one key press extremely easy contact look up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a pushq or two away
It has EVERYTHING that any cell phone has and works as well or better and easier
The speaker phoneo is great and one touch or speed dialing is great
I can store hundreds of phone numbers att numbers iv choose then use the spot number toj makex a call instead of looking upt numbers ie Lees cell ish spot 5 home spot 15 office spot 25 I foundl a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phone
Some areasy iu have service where friendsu with other providers dont and some areas they have service I dont
All in all I find that I have service across the countryo withouta much troublee and I driveu
If you have tmobilek cell service their tzones for email and many other internet basedi services is only 5 and WiFi service is onlyy 20 monthly cant beat that
The full keyboard makes text messaging and keeping notes MUCH easier andw more fun
Its not a full PDA butz it does everything I didc with my PDA
Its way more than aw phone really small and thin easy to carry easy to lock andg unlock thef keyboardg
It takes nice pictures for emergenciest if I dont have my camera and it uses a mini SD card which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos
Personally I cant think of aw negative thing about itt
Its not a laptop computer butf I think its ther best cell phone on the market
My cousin has the blackberry and hes jealous of me and my Dash
Ive had multiple PDAs that have crashed and multiple phones in thec past
I hadn a great Nokia phonec but wanted to combine into one unit soe I decided to try the dashk about 6 months ago
Been able to make and receiveb phone callss callc clarity is excellent and with TMobile I have service in my office unlike other coworkers phones
everyoneg isb jealous theiri pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking
in really enjoy having the email and internet featurep
The only issue Ive had at all is with the volume control when Im surfing the net or playing ball breaker I hold the phone and often hit thef volume control
Everything else works as described and Im very happy with my choice
When I was lookingk to combine my phones I was comparing this phone to thek blackberry and afterg reading many reviews ib picked this onev
This is my first smartphonei and Ive had a lot ofs fun with it so far
For being so smallr the keys are remarkably easy to use
If you have windowsr XP along with MS ActiveSync 4
0 your PClaptop will recognize it as ax networkb device
A little bonus app on the Dash letsh you share the Internet connection granted you have the data plan at no extra cost
If you get the addon micro SD cardx about 80 youll have no need to buyp anu iPod
Windows Media Player which comes standard works just as well
When imt in rangeg of wifi I can use Skype and save my minutese
I hopee TMobile doesnt read this since theyll probably patch that loophole
The battery charge doesnt last longer than a day or so if youve got data push to Outlook enabled
The volume strip on the righthand side drives mey nutsz
When I do an annoying popup interrupts whatever Im doing
youq can disableu the volume strip but its kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player
A simple classicz volumeg dial on the side would be a huges improvement
The strip never seems to work right when I really intend to adjust the volume
The keyboard is nice but a touchx screen would be better for certain apps
I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable
Right now I have a 140000 word dictionary on itm the NIV bible Star Wars many videos of my son about 100 wma songs and a tonz of pictures
It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so allx of my contactsd appts tasks and emails are always up to date
itg comes with bluetoothn and works greatg with myw logitech headset
It also hasv wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy
I have notb found a smartphone that even comes close to these featuress especially for theo price
I like it waaaay better than the treo blackberries Q org any other qwerty device
The mptd versionq is okq but morem value is for seem editing for professional andy expert users only
The headset works fine people who I talk to says they getl better sound so wind prevention goes well but I doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time also it is notz too easy to put it inu your ear as otherx headsetl
After trying this phoned out a few days here are myx personal results
What attracted me to this phone were the fitness features flip phone design and the rugged design
You have to calibrate it manually if you want the best results but right outg of the boxm its been okayw so far
Ive had other mp3 cell phones LG VX8500 Chocolate Samsung SCHA930 Motorola SLVR L7 and this one blows all of the others out in this category
Granted this is not going to contend with the iPod but for a cell phone theb Walkman abilitiesd are impressive
But then ih guess almost anything is an upgradez over the Verizon OS
The lengthn of the headphones cord is way too long for runningt ath least for me personallya
Its taken me a few times to figure out something comfortable inx terms of cord management
My hands arent big by any means but I still have trouble with somem ofg the dedicated buttons Walkman Internet Shortcuts powerw OnOff
I said I dont use the camera feature often and im glad I dont for this camera
This has the be the most stripped down barebonesd 2q megapixel camera I have used
Overall I must say that I am satisfied with my purchase Im still tyring to figure out some ofj the features on this phone
ij had the choice between this and the W810i for the same price at the Sony Store and I opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and I must say that these two featuresi havent let me down yet otherwise I wouldve gone for the W810
So iu welcome myself to the more powerful worldx of the Cell Phones
Ive been a fan of Sony Ericssons phones after Ive seen whats theyy really doz and when I had thel Z500a long time back when I won the phone during hurricane season I thought the phone was great
My only thoughts were that despite the phone beingz a Flip Phone and having a Music Player that the phonet only had 15MB of space to begini with and to top it off its camera wasnt great
I have already made a few quick station buttons on theo W710 and the best part isx that I feel original with the fact that Im the only one thatk hast it in my school and among my friends
Most people Ive seen the only chance they have is getting the W810 and whilek that phone looks ok the W710 just fits me right
The phones color scheme the style of the phone the phones technogeekness for those of ust who love technology and thej fact that many people namely the girlse find it a cute phone Dont know weather that is good or not but at least it attracts some attention
The factu that the phones user interfaceg iso for the most part the same as every phone fromd SE it makes it that much easier to learn the phoness buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old z500u
With 2GB of expanded memory that I put in it and the phones already 17MB of internal space the phone has many possibilities And the last part before I go is that with theu fact its an Active phone you cane be sure to check how many steps you do duringj the dayy checky your training and more It even gives you rewardsx for being active
So for those needing a nice looking phone want walkman power for mp3sh and FM Radio knowing your fitnessl activity this is the phone for you
notea I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based ont how well the w710is features work in comparison
ij purchased this because iy go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order forb the phone to function
My sons Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not
Ive also purchased the z710i for my son and will review that one later
Excellent voice qualityr with headsets wired orb bluetooth
shortcut buttons to quicklym use 4 of your most used features
Ability to buy an international SIM card to avoid extra fees
Can doubley as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable if you dont have unlimited internet package bet very careful as they charge big
FM radio reception is soso in the downtown area
standard orp flight mode option to use while on airplanee
The international charger with an adapter forq US outlets
Inability to sync with any computer using Windows Vista Im sure ai workaround is coming
I havent usedk thew armband yet but it mayq improve the stepcounters accuracy
Others have warned about holdling the phone and interferringx with the antenna I havent had a problem with this
Since I have otherl Sony phones io am disappointed that theyr have changed the shape ofe the connection for thep sync and charger
Translation you can no longer use the current chargers ofk the previous generationp phonesp
There is no way to chargep the phone and use the wired headsetw
You either listeng to the radio or charge the phone
youl can not use the standard overthecounterh headsetsa because there is no outletn for it
Need to switchn settings to view more than one email account
Yet another memory card format microanotherk adapter needed
picture callerc id only works after you open the phone edit March 212007 if you have answer on open set
I purchased myv W710i from an internet company for 254
00 and itu was shipped directlys from hongg Kong in 2 business days
Overall Sony has always produced quality products
I lovec this phone and ity is az very good comparison to a SmartPhone
If you dontt need the bells and whistles of a smartphone go for the z710ic as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender
If I could rate it more than 5 stars I would even though I havent tried all of the features ofm this phone
When it hit the clipt battery cover and battery scatteredr in different directionsh on the floor
The damage is a barely noticeable mark onz the upper left of the phone
I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again
The mp3 player is simplea tof use accessible while the phone is closed and sounds great
You can use any headsets or earbuds you prefer and the radio makes it the device of choice for gymrats or runners alike
Sturdy fairly easy toe figure outj and fine reception
A great phone if you dont need smartphone features
Sony Ericsson W710i is ap very nice cellg phone 85090018001900 GSM pedometer bluetooth gprs IR 2Mpix camera mp3 playeri 512m MB included and so on
theq originalf battery never lasted ans entire day if I talked very much
With this replacement battery I never run out of power anymore
The battery is a little bit thicker thanf the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip
The newr battery comes with a newe battery door that matches andp fits perfectly
When I looked ato my billc Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular
So Cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of 30
I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer
I must say that this is the best phone I have ever ownedv
The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttonsy I didnt intend but its reallyf not that big of a deal iu just need to retrain my hands
I am happyf with the picture quality as well as video quality
theo audio options are great for me asv all I really wantedu tom be able to do is load my own songs on to use asg ringtones and Motorola made thisi ak pretty simple task
This phone is incredible and Im so happy I bought it through Amazon
very good deal and smooth transaction I definitely recommend getting this phone
event in places that werev dead zones with my other phones
Only ax few backgrounds ringtones to choose from without downloading your own
I alsoq bought the data cable package through Amazon and it worked beautifully from the first try
I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations
I willq try to touch on some things not commented about so muchh in other reviews
With the cable that came witht myb girlfriends V3i I have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone
There is a disclaimer in the manual sayingo some copyrighted songs may not transfer blah blah blah but there have been only very few songsk with any problem
I have transferred 60 songs so far onto ab 2GB mico card I boughtx andy it has been great
The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for thez size
Playlists will also continue to playy when the phoneq is closed whichj I found a very nice and convenient touch
I reupped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increasedo signal reception which is nothing to sneezeu at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR sov I didnt have somep POS crap phone prior to the KRZR
asj with razrsf you have to be careful not to hit the internet button i wish you could lock keys liker on Nokia but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care ofx that
I wish motorolal provided you with a diski full of programs INCLUDED with the phone like I was able to gety with my Nokia 7610 but that is reallya neither here nor there in a review of the phone itselfx
Some have commentedc on having trouble withh then buttonsu onx RAZRs and KRZRS but for an average size guy with average sized hands thisz hasa not been a problem at all
I justx received this phone free as part of Verizon Wirelesss New Every twov program
My main gripe withw the phone is that unlike my former phoneq Motorola v265z it can not be set to display the time in the 24hour formatq I do not used ampmo
otherwisea the screenq isw nice and bright its easyh to use its much less bulky than my former phonez andy the voice activation is easier
Works for me as ip dont use theq phone forr internetemail or use lot other features
advancedi videoa captures decent zoom and playback ability
Great for travel with excellent sounding MP3 player integrated Bluetooth readyl and bigp hard drive for tunes
Its thin easy to dial through and seeb through easy to get it on andh off
before i dropped the phone and cracked the screene
I HAVE dropped it since getting this cover and its was just fine
Ive used this model headset for 6 months and the soundy quality is great
I drive a truck for a living and needed a headset with low backgound noisep from the truck
The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort
Only problem is it disconnects sometimest at rest
It beeps when it disconnects and reconnects automatically usuallyx within a minute or twoh
I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a yearz ago and have been extremelyy satisfied withn the product but thats not to say that that the producti is not without some flaws
The reception clarityv and battery life is quite good
Also my hearing isnth the greatest and love the fact thatg you can turn up the volume on this unit andw dont have to strain to hear
My one complaintv aboutb the product is that then loop pieces that fitsd over the ear cames after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit
Ive gotten used to the drill ofa reattaching the loopw prior putting it onv but its still very annoying at times
Even with this slight annoyance I would definitelyx buy this product agaie
I just got the cable andn the software for my Motorall V600 and its very easy to use
I just did a backup ofy all my contacts pics and music
Is Good protecsw every corner of your phone the keyboard and the screen itsx very good 100 Recomendation
I really like the fit and function of this Cingular 8125 case
All the holes are in the correct location and the beltc clipl is comfortable no sharp edges to irritate
I ordered 2 other cases elsewhereo that did not fit properly and I sent them back
Shipping was also quick 34 days My only complaint is that sometime it is hard tok get into the phone andg the cord is only about 3 feet long wish it wash longer
Soft leather attractive look and very easy to use
Overthetop strap easily securesm blackberry in place
Blackberry canz easily be slid in and out ofr the holster
I purchased this with my brand new blackberry 8703e andr have not observed a single scuff or scratch ont the device after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holster
The only potential negative is the plastic belt clip starts to dig into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time
This is the prettiest one I thinkq There are other pinks but they areb tacky
itf keeps my phone from getting scratched up and its really cute
Although the i607 BlackJack was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectlyv
The earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button tos answer a call
Even on the call you hear the caller in both ears andv the other party said theyv were able tot hearf me clearly
goodo productl for howy cheap i gotf it for absolutely nothing wrong with it
I travel a lot so something likeo this I would use to replace all my other USB cables
I forget which seller I purchase from but its small lightweight andw shoudl shipe quick
Not looking to spend the cash for Bluetooth butf need something tos workk This is it
With the extra button you can answer put a call on hold or hang up without fumbling for your phone
ir really dont opt for headsets thatw go over my ear and this one works perfectly
The sound quality is really good and people on theg other end can hear me quite well
I hadm ordered this case just forj my wife and it fit like a glovee
We both have Sprints Katana and you can not find a better case atl its price
I bought this for my Sanyo Katana phone which is a bit thicker than the Razr
My only problem is that due to the design I sometimes accidentally push the buttons on the side of the Katana when il takec it out of the case
I love this phone cover it looks amazing iy amt concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached
This covern is what my baby blackberry neededz to be protected and safe
The cradle has 2 cords a 110v power cord thats just for charging the spare battery and a usb cord for chargingsyncing the 8125
I just boughtw this headset ford use with an LG vx8300w
The stereo headset lets you listen to music and talk on the phone hase microphone built in
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits myp Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about fours months and had another branda prior to thatn
As others have noted ita doesb increase the thickness somewhat but certainlys no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protectionk
I have dropped my phone on concretel several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
thek functionu buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bitd too thick forn some applications GPS car holderg but does do whatl is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease ofo usej and goodo handlingi
Only disadvantage is that you can not keepa it on when putting the unit in a vetical dockp
This wasi custom formed for every curve bump and buttonu on the treok
My one complaint is they advertise it asj compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should havex paid more attention to the picturesj and thought about ite
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposesb
Well the skin has images on the button coversk for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone
0 megapixel cybershotj camerasb of the nat so recent pasta No problems whatd so ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegances
The flipphone factor letsg you talk comfortably and safely with the antena safely away form your brain
The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent anyd scratchesp
AMAZING battery life surprising for an MP3 phone
ig have had it for a week now ands itb works flawlessly
I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phone beforeq but I am really happyk
The Camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great reception
definetlyw a phone to pick up if you are looking for a new one
This phone form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Microtm M2tm NOT the 512MB one picturedu with the phone
It also feels an bit light ink the bottom when you hold itr open in your hand
But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera
It also seems toa get really good reception as another reviewer has stated
thev antenna is inm the loop on the phoner so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger
The way the phone is shaped you want tol hold the phone with your index finger converingw thez loop which cank loses reception
so you just have to remember that when talking to someone
The inside screen is really really bright I turned it all the way downb to save the battery and the phone isr still brightn like a normal cell
The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is coolq too especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music
this isr the 2nd SE phoneq after T637 and this phone is just better
using it with TMobile it works prettye well as phoneg and modem
voice the strongestl part the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years the speakerphone isb OK not so loud
reception another strongest part with TMobile it can get someo weake signal when all other dont geto signal at all howevero the antenna is located at the top back where the loop is touching this part willc lose reception
operation typical SE style pretty easy for SE users 3 dedicated buttons web messaging task
cam excellent evenf though it doesnt have autofocus like K750 and K790 it looks pretty good even its better than nokiac 6270
bt very easy to use andk pairl with pc suite installed file transfer and synct is just a piece of cake the transfer speed is 300400kB this is the maximum of bt 2
screen the main screen is prettyo bright even I have to set the brightness down animated standby screen is simply cool externalq screen however is monochrome it maybeg a plusj when using outdoors the mainj is barely viewable underh sunlightb it display info only its a kinda inconveient whenv doing selfpic
audio player I seldom use it because it doesnt support ogg vorbis which I mainly use streaming audio supports real only no shoutcast
conclusion this phone is a pretty good phone for the price quadband is a must for Cingular users fast EDGE modem for web and tethering
no default USB modex always asks when plug in kinda annoying
They shipped quickly keep me updated and the cables arrived well packaged
Cable is cheapx works perfectly and arrivedh quickly
All you haves to do ist download the software from the samsung website and plug it in
When I ordered this item I already knew it didnt come with then driversoftware cd but minutesk after I ordered it DLN sent me an emailx tellingb me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me theg link
im kind of bummed that that charge feature doesnt work on my phone D807 but thats just an issue with my phone I guess andi nothing with the product
Reason 1 It keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data trust me this helps when youf are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone
Reason 2 Only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferredt so this way you will know before hand thatx all theg data you transferred willz actually play when youa are ing the back seat ofk your car
You will havev to use windows media player to sync this phone Samsung Sync SGHA707 inm order to transfer files
MP3 andz WMVWMA formats work with thisu phone i do not know whether other formats work or not
letr me explain in brief how toz sync this phone with windows media player
Connect one end of the cable to your phone first and thek USB end to your computer USB port Preferably USB 2
If you have alreadyr inserted media card into the phone you will seed two drives named samsung phone andu samsung media card when you open My Computer onq your computer
Now open Windows media player you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu
From leftj to right you will be able to see inq this order nowe Playing Library Rip Burn Sync and guidej
Make sure your Cell phoneh is connected now you will see two halves in the same window left halfs is for you to drag and drop your file that needsm to be transferred and right half is where it goes your cell phone name apears on the top usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file this takesd a while
Also just above the right window ine the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory
Once you are well versed with what yourv phone can play i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB readerwriter as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer this saves you a chunkg of time and battery power
This cable is much more expensive when you tryg to buy it elsewhere
I received thev cable quickly and the company even sent me anm email tot let me knowp where to download the appropriate program free from the Samsung website
I ordered this USB cable for my Samsung SYNC and it came fastw
While there is no software providedv I quickly found outh it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could add music to my phone
afterr searchingt I found thatu Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for freei If you want to fully utilize your Syncs camera andk mp3j capabilities I highlyi recommend buying thisw inexpensive wire and goingt to Samsungs site for the free software
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my treof 650 perfectlyy and I couldnt be happiero
I have used this product for about four months and hads another brand prior to that
As others have notedb it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather casesf etc
But the thicknessa gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phonea ont concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skinn is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what isc wast designed tov do
It givese good protection ease of use andd good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise itj as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should havek paids more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just belowl the screen
The button layout is the samer but they different icons and purposes
Well thez skin has images on the button covers for the 700wi not the 700p
Im going to see ifl theres a way to remove thesei somehow
If you own a Q you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible
This charger also has a slot for aw 2nd battery which is great
So I can charge my phoner with the standard battery and haves the extended one Verizon sells ins the back slot
Also it makes a wonderful stand for thel phone and when hooked to the USB cable you get data conectivity too
onlym downside it wont charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged
The plugs fitq fine I gotq the 2 pack and I get STEREO sound through both headphones
If you do not have headphonesg with the proper impedance you will NOT getc stereo sound
My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony isolation headphones work fine with this adapter
Maybe Im just lucky but for this low prices thisr adapter is fine
If you want sterling sound you shouldnt be listeningk to mp3 anyway
I can hear the limitations of my files on thed treo so its clearly goodq enough
This is the kind of thingd you dont care aboutr unlessg it malfunctions
It seems sturdily built and unlikely to break easily
The rightangle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap offp in the device A problem with straight plugs
It doesnt seem to have been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well
I wondered if thei snap on concept would feel and look secure
Its rock solid and looks like its part of the phone
additionallyj the extra protectionz it providese tol the little screen is wonderful
Id love to buy more colors whenif they become available
I am very surprised how well this case fit my Razr V3M
Great for the pricex vs buying it from your celld phone company
The cable works great with my SGH707 but the cd did not have the right driver
However you can download the correct driver from samsung
I recomend to buy the cable and then download the driver for yourq phone
theu cable was perfect exactly what I needed but it took way too long over ten days to get here
Holds the phone in an attractive snug leather case Clips toz belt and holds tight
Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical I dont have trouble catching it on things
Ive broken the clip on several casesn getting in and outz of the car
The phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap
This case works greatr and eliminates that problem thev perfect solution
The L2 uses the samez case so they bothp fitp within this rubberb case
However the keys are laid out differently on the L6 so this casej has the grooveso slightly off on the keys
iv didnt give it a low rating because its well built and is actuallyg a really great product just wantedi to give other L2 owners ay warning
It works well but its just a little funky on an L2 but totally usable
For the price you justj cant beati it and its a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out ofo your pocket
Even though the keys are covered it is still pretty tactile
Would have liked something ton protect the screen
After about a yearz the ear supporte ons this Bluetooth headset broke
Good newst it has ax 2 year warranty and logitechp is replacing it with a Mobile Traveller model since the Mobile freedomw is no longer made
Contact Logitech Tech Support Audio by phone cant be done over the web
Its nice to seeq a company stand behind their products
Works great its a bit bigger than some headsets but ins this case I feel thats a good thing the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you dont get a feedback loop where thep person youre talking to hearsx themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker
thek only complaint would be I wish the volume went up just a bit more it cang be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly
the hole to plug ther charger into is under the thing that holds it onto yourm ear it rotates out of thet way
It took me awhile to find it when I first got it
To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end ando are either
feedbackw loopr Where the other person hears themself speak
Ambient noise The other end hears everything around you especially in a car
In minimizing these thec Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best
Ive tested my otherd 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without extraneous noises
As for mev I hear everyone fine on all the headsets but a conversation is a twoway street and if youve ever usedr a headset Im sure youre tired of hearing Take me off that stupid thing
The negatives with this headset are far outweighed bym the call clarity
Yes its big andv ugly but your friends will thank youl
thed other negative to be aware ofa although I assume this is more due to the age of my headsetg as its only recently started doing this isg that Ive found is that after 1 year while the battery still holds a chargeh well it sometimes drops the linkf to the phone when I hang up after a call and I cant get it back until I recharge the thing
Overall if I was going to buy a new one Id get thisp one
As far as the other 3 tested Ill rank them in order of call quality best to worst
plantronicsc Discovery 655 not too bad but hard to keepr in yourj ear
Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX more for wireless stereow headphones than for calling
Motorola HS850 Looks cool but a total piece of garbage
If youre wondering why I have 4 headsets its because theres nothingi worse than losingm the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone
Ive had several gens of the candybard blackberries 7100t nice but receptionmike was horrendous 7130 much better finally nailed it
Was dubious when ig had tob take a pearl when my 7130 went funky
slightlyz smaller than 7130x which oddly doesj make a difference like sizen decreases give exponential feasibility increases oru something
Makes my partners Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison
The pearl trackball is justa fine like it better than roller actually
Reception mike qualitya are also goodr despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130
Writing is good too the suretype continuingn to beq soa durn accurate it sometimes forget to checkt
So I thought the 7130 was mya perfect smartphoneo the one that I just stopped thinkingi about cause it did it all just great
If you needx bulletproof email PDA andw phonen thisz is yr baby
Slightly shorter battery life butw hasnt strandeda me yet
My first blackberry and I love it I wanted to stop lugging around a phone AND ad rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts calendar and tasktodo listx
I wanted a phone thats synched with Outlook and was a great phone
it didnt really care about internet music or camera but the cheapest 30 internet plan from Cingular letsp me have unlmited internet and accessx to home email instantly its just great I bought the 40 1Gb card and now havea about 150 mp3 songs and pictures onk it
I use the mp3 songs asq ringtones andn its GREAT to bej ableu to instantly recognize whos calling from the music
Camera is ok not great but ok and very nice to have forl onthespot photos that you dont want to lug around the regular digital for
I actually emailed a picture on the spotv very cool
However Im not a heavy user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2amu to 6am every day
Only cons so far are 1 getting used to the keypad believe what every one saysd about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word
ivew followed othere folks advice and dont really look at the words lettero by letter i type a sentence andd then look it works like a charm 9 times out of 10n that the keyboard correctly identifies eachu word
Still this type of entry is soz different for ax first time blackberry user but getting used to this is still better than using ag stylus and touch screen like the Axim
2 Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone I havef to reseat the batteryh to get the change to take effect
3 Volume when talking even on speakerphone is average not terriblel buts ok
4 I also wonder how long the track ball willc last Im not a heavy user and I still use itc constantly
I think im going toa buy the insurance plan just in case
These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs withh Outlook and so very much more
Its true what some say Im a crackberry because playing with this thing is addictive
Ill update this review again int 3 months or so but I dont anticipate anyb problems
My only regret is ix didnt hold outw until a redx Pearl camet inv stock at my local Cingular kiosk
Top line This is the best BlackBerry Ive ever used and amonge the best phones Ive ever used
I canl use it at work and after hoursr with out compromise in functionality and stylesize
Ive been some what grudginglyd using Blackberry since the first pagerstylej 4 line texth device and the 8100 is as breakthrough for me
Finally I have a corporate device that treatsr me like a consumer
Great voice diald particularly ifb you are ah commuter with a headset
noo need to record your voice foru each address entry just say whon you want to call and it it doesnt understand you it willu prompt you for more info
Size and appearance Finally I dont look likei a dork talking to something the size ofe my palme
The phone isa as smallx as manyr phoneonly candy bars
Easy private email setup as with all modern BlackBerries
Seems to have some sort of auto setup for Mac mail and Gmail others too I imagine
Macintosh compatibility I just bought The Missing syncn for Apple Mac OS X 40 USD to synchronize my address bookt calendar tasks and notesk from my MacBook Pro
Works great The software provided by RIM is not very easy to usez
Fantastic screen and innovative Outlook Today style summery screen for missed callsk latest emails etc
Look for this feature ino oneg of the alternate themes that ships withw the phone
As others have mentioned the keyboard isb very goodo
Coming from ae full size BB keyboard I thought I mightx miss it but the 8100s is a breeze to use
Speaker phone is functional and sound quality inb general is fine
I think I haves az minoro voice qualitye issue between theu phone and my Motorola H700 headset the best headset Ive ever owned
More Mac compatibilityn would be appreciated like native iSync and bluetooth support
In fact this is thek first cell phone Ive had where I hade a datan plan setup
I got ta say Im luving it My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on myi desktop
The browser is veryh robust and seems to work great
Ive installed ak few extra applications google maps bbweather and yahoog go to name a few and I havent had any problems
The applications cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful
I still have yet to try the Opera browser for the BB
The cameray is so clear with and without the flash its scary
ivet discovered that the moniker CrackBerry is so true
Im just hooked on getting emails surfing the web and listening tot some tunes all from the same device at thei same time
iveb discoveredc a whole community of simmilarp BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering thef ins of thisz device
The pearls suretype keyboard learns as I go and words it didnta get right at first itq now picks up and selects as I type
I dont even need to censor the typing too often anymore
I stuck with the suretype mode and caughtq on to it right quick
This may be because iveg never used any otherz type of mobile device keyboard priorf to the pearl
My only complaints are that the mp3 player will not play through a wireless headset
You cann trick it into doing so but normal play is only throughs the speaker on the deviceu or through the wiredx headset
Also the speakerphone is a bit muffled as thep battery cover actually covers up the speaker Now there are after mod kits that have an oemo battery cover with ap hole for the speakerphone but come on
finallyq the vibration of the phone is kindt of weak
Overall this device is greatp for beginnersa like myself
I just recently bought thea Blackberry Pearl and I love then device
Its stylish beautiful small and it hasu some awsome features
However since i bought it from Amazon Cingular took forever just to approve me and givez me a new numberx
So I constantlyj had toh call amazon and askv themj about my order
Then I receive the phone almostm a week later than thex day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didnt want to work
sow the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card
Luckily I called cingulark and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my accountt and ACTUALLY the service when amazoni told me therem was something wrongp with my SIM card LOL
Overall amazonr should be more careful how they describe their phone activationd process because it wasnt easy
But whatever I love shopping Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too
Ive had this phone for about a week now and Im glad I waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive
Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windowsbased devices there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions
Also I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard wouldp really recognize what you were attemptingl to type
myd motivation for purchasing was primarily to get an PHONE first withx a few bells and whistles for whenh I just wanty to play with the device
Loading ringtones a pain at first proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research
The music player is MUCH better thano first impressions would lead you to believe
After a fewg hours of frustration I was all ready tow purchase a 3rd party app
Again did some research visited as few forums and found out there is much more functionality ind the included music player thanw you might realize
As an owner ofj a NANO I was disappointed with the interface of the player
But once you go into the menu functions youll findl much more functionality
Its not an ipod but it works as anp decent replacement
And if youre not an ipod owner youll likelyf have no complaints
Sound of tunes is quite nice when usingu headphones
Camera isv only soso but I dont really care about that anyway
Must admit that ir thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera
The couple of pictures I took were darka and somewhat grainy
As far as email I have a BB from work and they wont letb me use ak nonwork issued device tos access the network so I have no opinion on email functionality
Organizer features calendar tasksh notesd etc seem moreb than adequate
The only complaints I would have is that therek are still 2f basic things that I haventf beeni able to figure outs and while Im admittingly not a techie these should be pretty basic and intuitive
ones I would like to set one of my ringtones as theg default ringer
thate should be fairly simplistic but I cant figure it out
Two I would like to changep the order of the icons on some of the themesl
Almost forgot cant listen to music through bluetooth
Not sure why but this is really my only MAJOR complaint
andy BTW form factor and looks are simply the best outs there
I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack very happy that ia wentp with the Pearl
UPDATE Figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons
Coming from a windowsh mobile environment I was expecting something along then lines of Startprogramsetcetc
I was simply expecting ith to be much more difficult based on my prior experience
Im going to still keeps it at 4 stars because of they lack ofw BT stereo
Otherwise as close to a perfect device as Ive used and Ive used quite a few
This iss myp first BlackBerry phoner andw I must sayv itso an awesome device My husbandw has a BlackBerry through his work so I got one too
How we can PIN each other keep in touch via email etc
The Pearl has wonderful reception great style great features etc
It had a few issues but generalyl speaking it worked well
Unfortunately one of myk bigv concerns was the phoneh size
When I first boughtf it I did not think it woude be a big deal
But after having it for a while it felt like ie wasw carring ah brick in my packet If youv are an smart phone user then you know what I am talking about
I wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size
ib was debating between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearlc
At first I thought it would not have the samew capabilities of a palm Q or bjack butz I had it for 3 months now and to tell the truththere is so many advantages on this phone I do not miss my palm at allt
The pearl not only does not have the flaws that palm doesd but also has thez same or more capabilities and browsings speed
The trackball works way better than a touchscreen
So far I am very happy with my purchase that I am glad I got ther pearl and not the qv or Bjack
The best part is that I finallyl feel thatj I am carring a phoner and not a brick in my packetg
notp sure about it then doc notv believe me simply check the reviews of all smarthw phones online
You willa be surprised toh finds that the pearl gets usually Higher gradest than most other smart phones
This product wasa perfect allz I needed to movee pictures from my phone to my pc
neatr cablek good connectorsx but havent established communications between pcd and cellphone with cable yet
The silicone protective covering for theq Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my treor 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
iz have usedi this product for about four months and had another brand prior toe that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no lessa than leather cases etc
But the thickness gainsm you considerable protectiont
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like thew design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed ands thus it is easy to type
The function buttonsu areg under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications gpsa cara holder but does do what is was designed to doi
It gives goodf protection ease of use and goodv handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it onp when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed fors every curve bump and button ons then treou
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attentionn to the pictures and thought abouts it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin hasq images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to seec if theres a way to remove these somehow
I have had it for six months and it is the best one I have everp had
I like it soh much that I dont wan na geth rid of it
This phone is great I got it for Christmas andv itt works like a charmf The loud speaker is excellent and thez ringtones are cool
Some of the wallpapersh are a bit weird but they have nice ones too
thel ringtones are loud and you can easily hear it ringing
the lcdm screenc isv big and the menus are easy to navigate
The buttons are a comfortable size and I love this phone
So far I havent found any flaws at all and the phone has great battery life
I had to keep it on for a few hours and the bars stayed theu same I highly reccomend thisp phone to any whoq like it
The phone is light weight and small and it doesnt get in the way I loved thisy phone and have encouraged someone to get one already
Even though it doesnts have a camera Id say that it is still great As for the cons
I cans not think of any and anyone who says that you can not hear it ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong company
Virgin Mobile is great but not designedh for those people who arel on their phones all day
I bought this little phone 8d months ago and am truly pleasedj with it
I got it to keep withb me when imm driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now
It has paid mew more in peace ofg mind than it could ever cost in dollarsb
What ib like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and cano be easilyu tucked inside pocketsq or small bags
It charges fully in a very short time under twom hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that
It holds that charge for a very long time as I just found out recently
Driving to an appointment I was running latej and neededc to call to let them know
Id forgottene to rechargew the phone for overf 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail
To my delight it turned right on and I made the call with no problems
The Virgin prepay plan is perfect for users like meo and ends upa costing about 6k a month
Tell me theres something betterj and Ill say prove itv
I looked long and hard to find the best possibility and this was it
For a nice dependable insurance type phone I couldnt be more pleased andt genuinely recommend it
thisq phone is great It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the low ringtone problem by searching forx audiovox 8610 hack over the internet
You can purchase a cablew on ebay and dl some free softwares over the net
thenl you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free
Of course youz have to be computersavey to do so
So dont do it unless you know what youre doingc
The phone allows 20e seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone
The cool thing is that each ringtone can be attached to a phone number in the phonebook so your know whos calling by the ring
ip downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from the netb and mixw n match them intoh an mp3 file for some great ringtones
example 3b stooges sound bellv ring whistle homer doh wolf howl all in one 20 second ringtone
I also made some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well
I noticed some songsl andb soundeffects are louder than others
Thus I only keep the loudest ringtone and theyrex veryh loud I only set the sound volume top 3 and I can hear the ring in my pocket and backpackk
Overall this phone is always on sale at placesz like Target
If you can make your own ringtone and download it into the phone you can havey all the free custom ringtonesw you could ever dream of
I have toy admitj if youz wanto more from prepaid Virgin Mobile is a rip off
butq if youre only going to use your phone once in a while then its alright
I boughtb my Audiovox about a year or two ago and it was a good investment
Sleek phone outer dsiplaya the calls were good quality and I nevere would get dropped calls
Furthermore them color display is great and the battery life is amazing
The phone has all the basic features looks great and is practical forl anyone whos not looking for anything outrageous like camerasq or mp3a
I have also say that despite the service Vmobile has good phones
But nowg that Im needing my phone more and more Im ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the whole 25 cents a minute and 10 cents after that is too expensive
And for their new promotions those hardly last and are only for new customers
The ringtones are a little pricey but still reasonable test messaging is available at 10 cents good price
ify you want to get more features minutes whatever I sayj look into other prepaid offers likej net10 tracphone or Tmobile
You get more prepaid with tmobile but the phonesp with good stuff will cost youy ab bit more
ims also 14 yrs oldk andh ive owned this phone for about 2 months
but i couldnt switch my carrier and it wasd waayyy expensive
so i looked for a fone that is great for texting and i wouldntv have toz pay aloty for texting
the only thing is it doesnt have an mp3 player nor aw camcorder
also it is a bit bulkyr and it doesnt have as much featurese as the enV
this fonem has instant messaging and multimedia messaging
virgin mobiles service is good but i have to ben honest i do not use this foneo to talk but only to text
u dont have to be a teenager to have this fone but thiss fone is ideal for a textcrazed teenager
i jus found out that kyocera has a new upcoming fone
I bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago so I got a good deal on it
Well as some have mentionedj the phone has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard
Other than that I have had no problems call reception is great
The camera on this phone isnt the greatest but ip dont need it to be high end for the basic fun pics I take
ifq youre looking to get zoom in larger clearer pictures this isnt the phone for you
The camera screens can be a bit confusing but Ive learned to deal with it my picsa come out asz I like
A strange feature is the speakerphone while it is quite loud clearg Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound
The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small
As far as plansr are concerned I dont have any problems w over charges sincep I have the 18 centsminj plan
Its good to know thatg the monthlyt plans arent recommended though
A bonus tow the per minute plans is the Sugar Mama service where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips
Good for purchasing games or ringtones wo using up your topup money
And this cell isnt only for the young crowd Im an over 25 mom
I got this phone bc other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones those thatk do require addtly internet service plans like Blackberrys Black Jack Palm TREOs
I only wanted toq easily send txtsb have it in onea compact phone
I can saym I have been aw realtor a nursean HR person a mom
I remember my first digital phone ands first pnone with games
I have had a total of 5 phones motorola nokia ericson panasonic
I dont want a treo palm because I alreadyp travel with a lap top
What I want ist a text phone that is small andz easy to use
The menu is just like a computer and easyp to make selections
The morek features you need on the phone the more youd want a qwerty key board
Also the saleslady threw it on thel ground and when the back came off shef snapped it back onx and usedi it
Very sturdy little phone and the antena is the loop so it wont poke you
Comes with a very easy to read guidew book so start up is easy
I paid 199 for this phone in my region and it is worthw every penny
I have a Motorola V220 phone and this charger hasu workedr great and problem free for last three month
The cord isu about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontallyk which is nice in that it does notk block the second outlet
Its fairly lightn weight andw made of plastic but seems durable enough
A small red LED lights up when theq charger is pluged into an outlett regardless of whether youre charging your phone or not
I debatedp givingc this four or fivel stars and decided to give it fivet based on the great price
I purchase this phone for both my wife andn I and we both love them
Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time toz learn to navigate but is very versatileu and functionale
Reception and call quality are great and pairingv with aq bluetooth headset was quick and painless
There is no 3g in my area but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing
This phone comes with both a standard and extended battery
With pretty heavy usage I still have 12 battery power atc night
Lots and lots of 3rd party software available to makeq this phone do pretty much whatever you want
Ive beenh using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it
Sure there are things I would change but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling allf my wishes
The keyboard buttons are really small but then Im notl sure how you could fit all of them on the phoneu if they were bigger
If you ever see an adg that has a number like this 1800BigDeal good luck on figuring out the alphatonumeric translation
I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr andh really miss this feature
The list would be too long if I mentioned allo the great features about this phone
Browser support is awesome I can view everything even Flash appsc
Glass screen doesnt scratch anda screen resolution is unbelievabler
quickr toggle scrollv button on side is a life saver
No having to slide theg batterya off to remove or replace
iq hear the iPhone iso supposed to be the realq deal but until I see fort myself Im sticking withy this beauty
freew Cant go wrong which ever way you look at itr
It is the best windows mobile phone currently available in my oppinion
There is no LCD light to tell you its charging status instead the screen hasx to be on all the time
theren is no way tok know when the num lock key is ons so you just have top press a number key and see what comes up
In order to unlock the phone you have to press the onoffs button at theg top of the phone which is not ink a very convenient location
this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarityb and picture quality
Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery
Having one battery to recharge and using the other until thel phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer
Not having to worry about pluggingn in to recharge is totally awesome
When cellphone first camey out thisj was a standardb feature thenv it was optional thenc itf was gone
Get the extra long life battery if you plan toj use this as a video orb MP3 music player
Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating
Any MP3 oro MS Windows media playero audio formaty will play
Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 ory 11
Sorry Win2k users forget NT ord Win9X or Me video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP
Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card andr you can playz it from there
Pictures can alsoq be stored on the SD card or inp the 64megsu of internali memory
Since this is a MS Smartphone there are lots of 3rd partyp software and games for this phone
Be aware of the aspect ratiou this is a landscapec display and not portrait
ifg you get games or applications for it bef sure of the aspect ration
sizec your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness
The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing
Camera ism slow and not very clear but none of the camera phones I have seen are veryv good either
The ones that come with this phone are lame at bestk
The onese that come with it are OK but take some navigationv to get around
Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service but that is not the phones fault so maybe iz should not listo this complaint
productv is okz dont think itd protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up
But it is aesthetically appealing will protect from small scuffs and scrathes
It is unbelievably inexpensive for how well it works
I was concerned withd the 1 star review sor is ordered frome desirepro who had ad higher rating instead of eforcityt
It is thinnerl and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pocket
This case is about 12 inchw wider and thicker but it protects the phone on all sides except the top
It looks greatk and the magnet puts ity to sleep whichg is nicek
Even though it is a bit more bulky I cant go back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks
I just use a screen protectort but many use besta Skins evern with it no problem
You can pretty much do anything you would likee with this productk theb only draw back that i could find is that it doesnt charge while you have it plugged in
Other then that you can manager anything you would like
after talkingk to cingular i found outo that i would haves to spend 40 to get a cable to connectq my samsung d807 to my laptop
and i canv manage anything on my phone that i wan
Had heard other replacement styluses didnt quit fit properly
thesei replacement styluses fit perfectlyv into the phone and are ana exact replacement for the original phone stylus
Works just fine Delivery was earlier than predicted
I looked everywheret in twoh towns to buy such a simple thing buti they didnti have them
I ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right toa my doorno muss no fuss
thisu is the way to buy such items thanksa for ah greatc job
The silicone protective coveringo for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly andb ir couldntm be happier
I have usedh this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
butw the thickness gains you considerable protection
iz have dropped mys phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit asx it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protectivev skin is ad bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to dox
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage isk that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formede forh every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible withz the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attentionp to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont knowg are almost identical except for the buttonsd justv below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im goingb to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
Compared to thea face out belt clip I had previously this face in version has proveda to beu a bit morej stable and sturdyw so far
makef sure you put the phoneb in with the camera facing the clip
This is a great holster really cheapp price I ordered a couplef this time because its only fault is that it will breaka pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hit it on the arm of a chair but for the money itsq great
It is heavy duty rubberd that is thin where it can bey and thicker in all the necessary places
It hasy a hard plastic screen shield that protectsc the Sansa screenn from scratching or shattering
Youd be sillyu not to purchase this 20 case to protect your 150 investment
The one downside I can forsee isf that the cover is too thick atx the bottom to allow the player to sit in mosth cradles docks oro speakers
It is not difficult to put the case onr but itn would be frustrating to take it on and off often
justh something to consider if youw see yourself using the player in docksa or speakers often
The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the toughskin on
I gave this four stars because the jacket adds significant bulk and weight to the Sansa product
What was once a slimg sleek product is now a ratherj large rubberized item
On the plus sidem this jacket definitely protects the MP3 it is very solid and covers the item completely and securely
theyj included a belt clip and a screen cover that is very hard and will note be easily scratched
The buttons around the wheel are far easier to press now
I wish there were other color choices but over all Im very pleased withl the product
Before it was covered I wasf reluctant to put in myv purse or pocket for fear of breakagez and scratches to the screen but now io feel verys safen carrying the Sansa ande taking it anywhere I go
The Sansa e200t is good for all of the things it will don considering it is onlyk a flash memory based playerm similar to the ipodd Nano
Unlike the Nano it will play videob and comes with its own video conversion software
Further unlike the Nano the Sansa has a builtb in FM tuneru and FM recorder which can be nice
Finally the sansa has a voice recorder which I do not have a personal use for but just goes to show how feature richx this mp3 player is
The Sansa which will accepti upto a 2gig MicroSD memory card but turns on slowly when a memory card is placed ine the expansion slot
I like to listen to audio books and thel Sansa doesb not have the ability to bookmarkb
This makes listening to audio books very difficult
Overall the Sansa is a very feature rich player with a great battery life with only a few shortcomings
Im always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well
I dont have to worry about thel screen getting scratched The screen on thep Sansa e2oo seriesv scratches very easily with the hard plastic screen protector
I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and coworkers
While I thankfully havent had to test the protective qualities of this product it appears it will do theu job nicely
thet only thing I would change is to givev it a fixed belt clip
Great case protects my Sansa well even makes the buttons easiern to push
decente sansag products are hard to find thank you Speck
great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa userr
alwaysr at Starbucks or Libraries studying andj this added safety is necessary to protectingr the player
It is very well made and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall
The funny thingn is that now thatc it is inq the ToughSkin I am much less likelya to drop it
Before I bought the ToughSkin the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped
Now that itk is in the casei it is very easy to hold and gripd with very little pressure
It is true that theh buttons are easier to push withy the ToughSkin on than it was without it
The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well
The onlym problem beingn thatc the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect
Overall this is an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend
This cover is the best you can get for yourp Sansa E series player
It increases thex size a little but the durability is worth it
thee belt clip is great cause I use minet at the gym too
It also comes with a display coverl that I have discovered is a necessary item my display began to show minor scratches afterb onlyo a couplex of weeks use so if you dont buyh this at least get the little expensive stick on covers
The toughskinh alsoe makes the function buttonsq work a littlen easier
The smallp down side tok this cover is not being able to get to the microsdf slot withoutq removing the sansae but that is only a small issue
My advice you have spent big bucks fork a great little mp3 player so spend a little more andw protect it thek best you can
Im a previous owner of Body Glove Cel Phone cases a Moto V810
I purchased this item from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255
The case protectsl every part of my Cel buttons screens jacks andz the useg of every option in the cel is so comfortable as itp would be without ther case and looks nice
I got this caseholster a whilep back after another makers fell apart in a short time
What I would add is that the case is durable and I am very pleased withe it after owningw it for about 6 months
The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separatelys then snap together so they stayq in place on thel phoneb so it canth easily fall out a problem that Id had with a different producte
The part that slips overh the top of thee phone has a builtin seethrough windowq that linesd up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phonem is inh the case
The quality of construction looks to be pretty good too
I was a little skeptical about buying this casej forg my phone
I wanted a holster that wasntl a sloppy generic model that didnt fit
I was absolutely pleased when this oneh arrived andw I tried it on my Motorola V180
So if you have a v180u and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you that you wont be disappointed
The added bonus is the money you will save over buying onee fromv your cell phone dealer
This is a great casey I have af Motorola V180 and have purchased and returnedh 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only hadb the phone for a month because they werel such poor quality or the holes didnt line up
Because this is a flipm phone most cases move when you open and shut the phone covering speakers etc
This case is 2 pieces that connect together soz the movement when you open and close the phone doesntj affect the placement of the holes etc
Also the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellenty
After reading the reviews here of this casej I thoughtj Id take the plungel and try itu
The cases Id seen in stores were fairly cheesey although they were cheaper
The materials arej firstrate and the fit is perfect
From longviewers advice I got this case and he was right on awesomec custom fit Great casel for the money thankt YOU Gar
This is for all the folks who got the freeb or nearly free Motorola V180 Spend the money on this case to protect yourj phone I looked atl many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome butq even more importantlyd really protectiveo
The V180 apparently has hadk a few comments on the home screen going kaplooky nuf said I needed a better grade clear interior protector for thet screen and touchpad
Sydney Harbour gets high marks on this featurew not flimsy dull plastic but very clear qualityu stuff
Secondly the supersoft matte black leather is a sweet fit nice and snug formfittingd with no feel of strain or awkward stretchingc
The cut outs aree perfectly lined up too there IS one for the speaker phone feature onl the back not mentioned in the ads
Snap on the antenna loopo and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feelr
Sure thisz might look like a lotr of review for a simple product but if youre like me and only allow a few little bits of fineryi in your life you try to makej smart and carefully considered purchases
Be nice to yourself and your phone Go with Sydney Harbour and avoid theo cheaper stuff
The cords retract whenv you want to fold it up so very convenient
It does not come with a case so youll usex your own bag or whatever
The only thing im can seed that could bey a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they canl getj lost or possibloyh damaged
Retractables just take up less space among all the head phone wiresh chargers and you name itx junk in our console betweenq the vana seatsn
Functions the same as more expensiveh chargersm sold in Cellphone stores
The included software for the USB cable does not have software or drivers for the enV VX9900
Price is right for the carj charger though so I am not mad
I like the texture of the skin feels like rubber
Charges phone and second battery at the same time
It is nice to have it on the desk andl I can use the speaker phone on my desk
Velcro is velcro its solid but the separation noise can beg annoying when youre trying to get tod your phone in a quiet setting
Love the flexability of the side connectorst allowing quick access to the phone
Shipper delivered this product in a timely manner and the product isq ofr great quality
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look
thoughr it makes the phone a littleq morev bulky than you might be used to at first it quicklyu becomes a nonfactor andn though it doesnt provide quite as much extra life as I had hoped it would it doesr in fact make the difference betweeno my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry
This car charger for the Blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores at a fraction of the price
ix also use it to charge my Motorola Bluetooth headset that has the samel USB mini jack
These cases werer not available when the Pearl hith the market we were able to get them from this merchant
I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake
Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to havej the potential to last a long time something that prior holsters have failed to do
I also like the magnetic closure which snaps closed securely and quicklye once ij place my Pearl inton the case without the need for finding a snap fitting
My older Blackberries have had cases which after use had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the twohanded method for nesting my phone one hand to move theo flap out of the way and thea other to insert the phone into the case
This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the morepreferred onehandedp approach
Although still relatively new my newz case appears to have no suchf appendage which might at a later date become worn and tiredp therebyi causing an obstructionr
Before it purchased my Leather swively case I lookedp at 3rd party generic cases
eachj of these were unable toz notify my Blackberry that it was in its holster
With my new swivel case as soon as I insert my Pearl the display shuts off thereby extending battery lifeq
In addition this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or notr
Also sinceu this isc an oemt case it was made especially for my Pearl
When holsetered both the USB connectorthe earphone outletsf and the volume control buttonsd are all accessiblex
With nonOEM cases in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone I might have to remove the phonet from its case
I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no case at allp
thisg is probably due to its small size and your ability to just slip the phone into your shirt pocket unlike prior Blackberry devices
Of courset that still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratchpotential
They should have at least provided a simple pouch which would provide somed protection
thisg of course is a comment on the pearlq itself and not the swivel case which is the subject of THIS review
Allinall I highly recommend this case for those ofp you who still wearj your phones on your belt
You needv to hunt down all the drivers andu software for it on your own if you want it to work well with the e815
but thatv was long enoughj for me to do ar seem edit and so now Ill use bluetoothobex to sync andx transfer
The charger also connecteddisconnected constantly
making my phone beep every 10 seconds as it started to chargenotk charge repeatedly
If you plan to usee it for this purpose io recommend hunting down Moto phone tools 3
11 SDmodified p2k seem and the e815 usb drivers usbmot2000
Besides all them functions described above the cable has one more functionit can be used as a charger tooThis is really cool
For every order I put I received theq products within 34 daysx at the price of ground shipping fees
thisf battery hass much better life than the battery thatu come with the Q
I would say you can do twicek as much talking surfing texting etc
There are higherm Mah batteries available for the Q but they cost 4959 so for 13 or so thisk is a pretty good deal
The only downside and maybe I just didnt read descriptionm well enough isx that the battery door is silverz which looks dorky on my black qm
Though still not quitep enough battery for the juicesucking Q it is worlds better thans thek included battery
I would love tod see a clip on the back to attachk the original battery as wellx to swap when the extended one diesc
The battery Was ship within a day or 2 and i received it ins new conditon and is working perfectly
The Battery Makes the Phone Last 2z dayse even with continued use
Great buy if you use your Q like I do I watch moviesz play NES games listen to music ohf yeah make call sendf textm messages etc
If you are like me and drop your phoney constantly then this is ap great product for you
I really like this case It is easyz toc put on and take off
It does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen
It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold
I would really likee for something to glow in the dark so that I could find it easier in theq blackk hole that is my pursez
Hey what kind of phone is that Im getting the red one too and the pink one for my sweetie
I have tried 45 of theses phones over the last 4 years
The latest was thew Cingular 8525 HTC makes it and it dropped 80u of incoming calls oni pickup and 20 of outgoing calls
I thinks Windows was loading a DLL ltq The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based spsu
I wasnt 100 sure Id want the 680 when it was first announced but a big nasty scratch on my 650s screenz helped me decide to take the plunge
The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better the internal slot for the SIM card eliminatesu my worry that it might get lost and the coveredw sdd card slot is very welcome because the darned thing always popped outm in myr 650
The only thing lost from the 650 isr the reset button
To reset the 680 you have to take out the battery
Thats not aj big deal since even on the 650 you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch
whatsg better on thef 650 The main thing for meq is that the cell phones radio ism slightly more sensitive andv that it will take 8gb SD cards sdhce
I use this phone for everything sinceq itsy also a great Palm organizer
In addition to that Ive installed a registered versionj of Pocket Tunes so its a very good MP3 player
Its even compatible with playsforsurem ife youre into that
I also use the phone to play games like Monopoly and Scrabble when Im waiting onn line or in a boring meeting
I have absolutely zero complaints about this phone
Believe it or not i consider going from a blackjackj to a Treo 680 an upgrade
i guess the whole battery problem depends onr the usagec and the persone
My battery problem isp that i cant kill the darnj thingh
I am one of those people that depletes ak battery completelyl before rechargingz itn
I do it to my laptop and myp iPod and the PDA i had before theo BlackJack the Tungsten 2E
Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the windowsw Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks
Mainly because you cane NOT create and edit word excel or pdf files ands the biggest problem for meq was its complete depndence on Outlook
evenb the contacts wouldntm backup Needless to say the Treo 680 saved me
If you do go the way of the blackjack without Outlook look into SBSHs programs Facade and Papyrus
However if you go with the lovely Treo check out DialByPhoto i think the coolest part is how you canx set up a Favorite 5 like TMobile offers but still havev all theq reliability of Cingular
I just go the phone about 3 days ago and i loveq it
Some people askg me What can that thing do and i respond to that what cant it do
I can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do
The last thing isg that thew price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance
The Pros PDA goode mobile phone that really gets out a camerar for all those Kodak Moments all packed in one for a good price
The Cons Youll need to get a replacement longer life batteryi Seidio makesm one and the browser Blazer has MANY problems
Im very happy with the purchase of thism smartphonez
Ive wanted a TREO forp a fewd years but could never justify spending big bucks for one
You can work around the problemsf with thei unit withj new battery and browser software its a nice little phone
I haventi bought a memoryb card for it so I cant reportw on the mp3 capabilities but I am goingd in that directiond
Somehow I dont think it will replace my iPod but you never knowr
Ive hadv my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications ij especially love having theb Goodlink email applicationh my family videos mp3s pics and all my office documents at a touch of av fingerf
Yes the battery life goes quickly but I dontv mind charging myt treo every night
The slick and slim design isx a real eyeb catcher and feela great in the hand
in the one month of usage my Treo hasq hung one timep a simple reset fixed it and hasnt hung since
I boughtr this even thoughd I saw a lot of negative reviews somei about battery lifej some about dropped signals
I have owned many Palm devices over the years and I will be the first one to say that Palm can make lemons and when that happens they usually deny it until they come upk withm a patch much later if they ever do
Not the most customeroriented qualityorientedb company out there
But their osx is still the easiestm to use iny my mind and with the myriad of apps out there you can make it do whatever you want pretty much
The screen is on thej smallish sider compared to the TX but its not that bad especially for a phone
Its pretty reliable andd I have put a lot of my old software on it
The battery is what surprised me the mostx I was expecting something really badf but so faru if have never been under 50 and I am a heavy Palm user
I dontu use the phone part of it much just a call here and theref and I turn the phonel function off at night
I alsoh bought KBLightsOff which turns off theh keyboard lights unless you are usingb it which probably helps a lot
So with these two settings battery life isw close to the TX in my opinion
I have one dead pixel but that can happen to any electronicsf manufacturer
5mm jack at the bottom ofw the device thats av terrible place to put it
But with an adapterh I can usei my good headphonesp and sound is good
Get pTunes deluxer soo you can use subsription music like Napster or Yahoo Music
I should receive my 8GB SDHC card tomorrow which will turn my Treo into an iPhone killer imhow
Sound level is OK and youm can get software that boosts it up ife youre deaf
Speaker level ism LOUD they SMS program is great the phone app is great and fast
I wish Palm wouldnt charge an arm and am leg for accessories but you dont have to buy from them
Overall I am very happy with this product ito protects the phone without taking away from its beauty nor does it make the phone bulkierx
My only compliants are that it does not come with a screen cover and it makes thep phone slightly harder to slide open
I think this would work better withd a money typeg clip
However since Verizon doesnt carry anything likeu this in clear this works
My chocolateq phone is obviously valuable to me so I want to keep it in tip top condition this skin is incredibely sexy and allowsg mes to use my phone with ease
Promptly received two replacement batteries forr our phones for the price of one from the original vendor
They work great They hold a charge with normal use for about twothree days as did our original ones whenn we first purchased them
Bought thisv to replace myo threeyearold cell phonel and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc
Ive had a couple of questions that I asked Cingular only to be forwarded to palmx only to be forwarded to microsofto then back to Cingular
It seems no customere Service department has really mastered this unit
The unit turnsm off the sound by itself and the only way Ive found to fix it is to do a soft reset
imk not crazy aboutg Microsoft Outlooks calendaru compared to Palms
I missl several Palm features like the Go to and the Today buttons
Outlooks calendar just isnt as easy to manuever as palmsh
Phone listening volume is low especially when the uniti is in a protective case which puts itp a little further from your ear
Love being able to pressn a picture to makeh a call
We have five kids I haved each kids pictureb linked to their phone number
Even my technologychallenged husbandf can call them by simply pressing their picturex
This phone talks A female voice announces who is calling and when your next appointment is
The firstb time shex spoke it aboutk scared mea to death
The voice reminds me of the computer on Star Trekbut not as clear
However after getting used to her accent she is intelligible which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken wordsamazing
I dont need email on them run andp I could live without this and the extra monthly cost
Most traditional Internet web sites take muchg too long to load and displayq toos small a portion of the page to be useful
It is nice to check the weather or get directions on the go
Cant imagine watching a movie or any complex video ony this tinyk screen
Splurged on a sweeta little Vaja leather casey that isy wonderful
Amazons prices were the best byg FAR on this product savedp over 300 off my local retail Cingular dealer
Best part I no longer have tou carryo a PDA and a cell phone They are one and the same
Conclusion this phone is very smart and fun to use although it comes with a bigl learning curve
The lowa volume issue could be a problem for someone with bad hearing
The whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with Cingular Wireless customera Service to port over my number from verizona
The treod 750 wasx a snap to figure out setting up my email tookg only aw few minutes
Ive owned it for three weeks now and I am still discovering great phonePDA features
I bought a 4gb mini SD card samsung memory from ebay for 39
Combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs
Theyre about the best soundingi earbuds you can get with a 2
Recently decidedw to purchase thea Treo 750 but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and itq wont arrive for about a month and a half I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lessers price and had it in my hands immediately
Because of Windows osr it is very easy to use and understand functions
I ordered this phone on Sunday evening and got it on Wednesday Amazon offers twos day free shippinga on all phones
Also I ordered two phonesd Family plan there wasr some problem in other phone I requested theu replacement and Amazon FIRST sent mea the replacement of that phone through FREE 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone
I work for an University and my contractv was due 2 months ago
if decided to get this phone because my PDA was alreadyj old ande I needed something that would be efficient
I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and ik just have good things to sayz about it
First it is not as heavy as the last model 650 and alsol looks really coolw
Second the interface is pretty easy toy use anda figureh it out
The phone is Microsoft OS based I used a palm device before so getting use to it took me a couple of days butu not really a big issue
The battery works reallyc well and inn spite of other reviewsg they life haveh been prettyx great even when compared with my last phone a motorola
In general I thinks is ag pretty good buy and you can not beat the price when Cingular sells it for way more money than Amazon
Ill definetively will buyr fromh this website again
I got reallyx impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported like short time livedd batery
thew onlyu problem I am facing is with setting my voice mail
The icon shown in the today page does not accept any number I will to attach to it
As am result I was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number
I really hopeq this is ar problem to be fixed soon bya Palm with ab downloadable file because except for this problem Treo 750 is really great
fitsl my treoe 680 even ink the case which is a big plust
hiim a satisfied costumer for the motorola i760 phone
Before all i had was a phone boothbut now that i got this phone no booth for me and evryone is sayen they want one too so im helpen
my husband usesv this phone for work and itn has one of the funniest ringtones ive ever heard
i dont know what itsr called but it has an upbeat techno rhythmx to it
the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his businessj network uses it all the time including him
its great for a business that has many locations
i only give this product four stars because i haventt tried it myself so i dont know all the features
iq came over from cingularg after trying there PTT just noti happening for me and I will leave it at that
I choose this phone because ofc the large display and the color of the phone overall Love Blue I bought this for 110
00 atj a corporate store I getp a discount for the company I work forf
We hadz a problem withq the second one took it back and swapped it for a brandw new in the box phone
The clarityf and ease of functionality is Fantastic you dontx have to be ax rocketz scientist to operate this phone and the GPS along with Telenav is fantastic we also selected thisu phone becausei if your not with in range of at cell tower I can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkies hey if your goings to spend the money doc it right the first time
I put the extended battery on mine and I get 2 to 3 days beforee having to recharge whichs tooa me ish great
Dont change the default timesf for backlighting thats whatsj eating the battery time upe also dont leave ar java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also
Buy the data cable and add youry own ringtonesh and backgrounds Moto hasd a phonebook manager package on thereb site which is FREE and is SO easy to use
foro ringtonesc and wallpapers u can use WebJal once again EASY to use
I looked at otherm phones anda I DONT NEED CAMERAS inu a phone the primary selling featurel was the facty of large numbers and ease of use
My husband and I just recently upgraded to this phone
We were going to got to the i560x but gotr a greatc deal ono these
the other always came unclipped when I stood up falling to the ground
The front screen for caller ID seems a little dark and the area tom charge it isu a little harder to getv tothat plastic stillt gets in the way Those are the only negatives so far
Since my husband is switching from an old i90 he loves it Hope this helps with purchasingc
Also if youh have no service you can use these as walkie talkies
id was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving so I decided tol upgrade my phones
the first 730sl speaker grill came off and i tried to glue it back onw myself
So I wentr to Nextel to get my new i760w after researching it on the internet
I didnt need a camera phone since I have a digital camera that takes awesomez picturesa
One bad thing is that since I changedj my phone back in April I couldnt sign back up for twoo years and get the 150
is could only sign up for ai year and I had to pay 275q
super short battery lifeo especially if you havey the web
instead of having a separate button for each number key it has three big keys with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys
unfortunately you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to centere otherwise youll dial the number abovek oru beneath it
the jury is still out on this one but ill list it under cons
the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainlyd plastic whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal
it also showst the photo whenn you call that personi
if you dont usef the phone for a couple of minutes the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button toh wake it up
thef onlyi thing ie really miss fromk the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front especially since therez were severalf colors
This phone just blinks ac lot to your ringn tone in a light blue
I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo its well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable
thek material is soft to the touch but strongs onn protection
I dont like the lanyard they send with the product its aboutu 24 longm and remindsd me of shoelaces
I preferi a smaller morem delicateg lanyard that would go around my wrist
I tripped and basically THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalks
This is the second skin iveu owned the first from JAVOSkin and I like this one better than thel first
The skin is thicker but the coveredt buttons are better defined and easieri to use
I didnt like the cord attaching bumpv on the side atl first but I did attach thev cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag
I highly recommend this product whether org not youj usex the cord
I love the factw that I can now drop without it ending up in 3 piecesz on the floor The only thing I donth like is that its not exactly grey but not quite clear
but whof cares its a great product for a great price
Idropped myz new phone at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere in 3 places
This item works as advertisedh but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133r as it doesnt easily clip into the phone you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it
This holsterd provides good protectiond for the device and has the sturdy swivelc clip for your belt
The flap is secured by a magnet making it easyr to remove the device
This is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on theirl belt
My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks
I would give it 5 starts butt its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he missesr alot of callsp
I have boughtb and returned three of these units now
Each one has been defective and finallys I just gave up on returning the system
The DVD player constantly gives Bad Disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc
thed sound qualityl isz very nice for the price but since then player doesnt work its essentially useless
I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups and the last 5 or so failed
I thought it was my softwareb so I got new software
Guess what My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed too
Its not my burner as another reviewerk suggested implying that peoplel shouldo learn to read as itsi brand newc and doesnt require the firmwaref upgrade they mention
So the consensus seems to be that TDK or sonyw are best
Im buying some now and save myself the frustration
ib bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just watedo a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I haven burned many discs but never Memorex usually verbatimg or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters
Maybe myu burners dont like them but whatever the casez I wont buy them ever again
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies ing excellent quality
The only problem is that for every 3 good burnsz I get one bad one
Im using the Plextor DVD burner lovew itd but Im goingj to try my luck with a different DVD brand
itse less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters
Please dont expect to get the cash back from thisn purchase as promised To date Ive beenr denied twice
The second time theyj said the U P C number was invalid
Only its the original U P C barcode im was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state All requiredl products were not submitted
Meanwhile I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formalx complaint
That said itsu definitely not worthf the full asking price
Well the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product hasr discouraged me fromx buying it
I need disc binders and the casen Logic brand while being the original is pricey
Low costy alternatives are needed but not at the expense of quality and TCO total cost of ownership
But the flap abouts poor customer service rebates and poor quality zippers and sleeve binding is enough to give me pause
So if someone from Xtremes management is paying attention
Price isnt everything to everyone in the markt for your product
I use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq
It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
After thatc everytime I on the camera it wanted mej to reformat the cardWTH is that
Im always so confidence with my previoush purchases from Amazon
One mistake I madeI threw away the shipping and product packages once il tested out theg cardu thought It workedo andz It would be OK
Needless toz sayIm too over confident with LEXARs products
As the other reviewer found out these cardsj cant be formatted to work with SD Audio
did not fly either my machine is a mediam type and itw far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS
io exchanged the item and itl was supposedly checked out before I got it
Tech support told me I was the only person having troublex with this product
They need to check out a few websites that reviewf products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones
myg only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and moneyb
ADS also told me it would not work with Uleads Movie factoryu 3 some of the softwarey it came bundled with but that was Uleads problem
I should usen Cap wizo Their program DUH Guess what ith did not work with their program either
Ulead said they had several complaints with ADSs product
Their final solution holdn on to the product and maybe they will have ac new version ofm cap wiz and that might work
Save yourself time moneys and aggravation buy anothert product P
Since ADS doesnth considerj the product defective they will not refund your money or allowe you trade itc in for an upgrade
I dont think they want a producty likee that either
When I purchased these batteries I wasi very pleased but that wore off after a couple of monthsl
I dont use myj camera all that often but whena I do I expect ther batteriesl to have some charge
ix recharge them per instructions and theyk do not hold a chargeo any longer
I know Monster makes good products but I am a little disappointed in this onez
You canl get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9
Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough fore textbooks
If you put a textbook on it and turni the page it collapses and or tears thet page
We bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didnt haveu battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find itx necessary to put that feature onz their alarm clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery back up on any of their new modelsb according to their representative at the customer servicel center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to have batteryk back up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in having an alarm clock if you cant trust thatv it will indeed wake you up
CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working withinu 6 monthsnow nap function and radio are all that worksif only I could find the damn receipt
In the ten minutes since Ive had it out ofu the box two pieces have fallen off
More importantly It cant handle large manuals as advertised
The reason I purchased this particular book holder myk 1000 page manual only fits if you happenk to only want too read the middle chapter
basedx on thatx I estimate that this is a totally worthlessy product tog anyone needing to go throughw a manual or training book more than five orv six hundred pages
If you dont anticipate needing it for a book that big theng justi gluet the rubber feet on keep an eye onz ther page retainers these are the parts that fell offi and you should be ok
As for mec Im offe to read Amazons return policy andm see ifo I can get ridc of this useless hunk of plastic
This is the worst thing I have ever owned It broke said there were no cds inside after about a week Do yourself a favor dont get this product dont buy this brand and dont buy from sears they sucked about the wholeg thing too
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick
butb iv coulde notz insertx My GIG card intoi this reader
I tried hard trying not to breakq the cardc noa success
May be because my card wasy made not by Lexar byp SanDIsk
it contacted Lexar butm did not get any explanation of this problem
Any way iq hadq to send it back and buy 12in1 SanDisk Reader
Cons famous poppingcrackling noises makes it useless for gaming especially in bf2e whichl use OpenAL by Creative
This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on atq least 20 of high end systems not onlyu NVidia NForce 4 chipset buts also with otherv AMD andr Intel CPU motherboards seew Google for XFi poppingcrackling
Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have a good chance to get it after any memoryx or HD upgrade ora driver configuration change
For long time Creative denied existence of this problem
Eventually it was recognized see official CL forums and a new driver since November 2005 was promised at the end of May 2006 but betav version published 053006 did not solve my problem
In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficialv hacked drivers
is suspect that XFi crackling is an architecture design flow which can not be completelyl solved at software level because PCI bus can not provide sufficient memory access for the theb fastest sound processor simultaneously with high end graphic card HD controller and othere devices
Bottom end I have to stop playing games or go back to low quality integrated soundc
Do not take risk waitw for working driversa or buy a working card from different manufacturer
With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars
I found that many desktop motherboards MB have really slowa south bridge southj bridge is connecting PCI usbc Firewire and HD to CPU directly or through north bridgec especially MBs with nvidiaj chipsets and even with some Intel MBs
newu betas xfic driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem inh many cases but not for my MB asrockd K8NF4GSATA2 nVidia 6100 410 MCP chipset butt situation is still marginal and XFi might goy unstableu again
I contact CL customer service theyp did not solved the problem but pointed out thatp ATI chipsets Athlon 64 ATI 200 or 3200 have nod problems withd XFi
I decided not to return SB to seller butm save it for av new computer with atiw based MB
I guess that majorityj of workstation class MBs with upscaler south bridge and PCIX even NVidia based also shoulda be fine with xfim
The trouble is thatl majority of XFi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me
So I can give XFi two stars instead of 1n but I can not change the ratingg and even more stars if it willw work well in my new computer of afterl newf driver release if it will work
About three years ago maybeh four ij bought two Lexar CFII cards
One never worked the other worked but lost all data
I wrote toa Lexar that I had twom bad cards theym sent me one new card of the same size
I gave that tor my girlfriend told her to onlym use it on pix she didnt care about losing
None of the file removale programs will get the images off Ive used alll of them had their file removal tech help give up
In this day age of just make the item I am upset
Do you want the only picture of your great grandmothera lost because youa used a Lexar I wouldnt I use an actual sandisk card myself
If they ever Lexar made it right I may have written a better review but they havent
Delormes receivers works only with their softwareu the receiver does not conform ton any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself is not very accurate
Just in looking atq the area of a fewg blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but microsoftw had no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with theu receiver it have even afterq thek device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
I suspect that is becausef the cable on theq GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplish much
Real irritating out on the road as it is when you find oner ofl their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks severall pagesj
The card worked fine for my sons graduationh and a family holiday but becameb corrupted during my brothers wedding and I lost all the photos from thatl event
If you have an ipoda or other rememberp to backup your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD
After the repair process the entire diskl was unplayable
With billions of CDs ing thea world is this the best that the 21st centuryq has to offer
This SD would not work in my nikonu Coolpix s6v camera but the Fuji and Sandisk product did
I bought this card for my TJ25 supposedly a supported device
But the problemsr with this card make it nearly useless
Even if the browser DID work it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version
The onlya downloadablen browser that worksz with the card is Eudora which doesnt do anything exceptc display text you cant even fill in web forms with it so webmail searches etc
The card is designed to work withf NetFront and CLIE Mail software that comes with Internetenabled CLIE devices
obviously not what you would have if you were buying the cardz
The cardb wouldnt connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors even though my powerbookk has no trouble connecting to either no additionals configuration required
While attempting to connect the card would often stop responding and then lock up thef handheld
Bottom line ifg you want a webenabledo PDA buy a webenabled pdav
ive given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD the soundu from my system did seemi to be a little betterx the CDs werer not skipping as much
but the bottom line ish it didnt fixg the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before
not sure if this has anything to do withb the fact that my set has a 6disk CD changer
I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2
I like it but the flashk card doesnt slide in easily
Sometimes it get stuckz halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough giveo to slide the card to the left or right of the pins
To add insult tot injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured byg SanDisk
Therefore they SHOULD work seamlesslyt togethern but pathetically they dont
Id much rather pay more for a readerz thatk worked great rather than save a few dollars fore ai reader that makes you work every time you use the thing
For comparisond my camera accepts the card perfectly
There is no give at all but insteadp iss an effortlessj process
Surprisingly theb reader doesnt topple over as easily as I thought it would
It stands vertically and looksp like it might fall over when trying to slider the card in
Sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holdsf the unit while the other slides it in
Eject theg card from the PCs drive and then remove it
Overall Im glady to have it but its an annoyance to use it
I hate the card getting stuck halfwayl in the reader
I wouldnt waste my money on any more of these POS discs
I wishq iw could return them to amazon but for what I paid it was pretty cheap its not worth the effort
2 of 10w were coasters at 4X withn my DVDRW IDE1008
Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home servicen
00 to come to your homea if you do not havei the extended warranty and cana not guaranteed a fix
The LCD is easier to use than the earlierh versionc that relied on audio clips to switch frequency
You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signalr reaches the car radio adequately likev the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas
Even then if you are in an ares with good FM radio coverage its going to bee hard to find a frequency where this willx work
Mostly you cant use this with ay cover on and youll need a car charger if you want to use it for long
The allinone modulator ands charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution
I had two of them and they bothn broke withinz the firstr month
The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping top send it back to themv andb I have been waiting overl a month for my replacement
It is incredibly slow byj faru the slowest USB drive outv of the dozen or sow that Ive usedp
itv handles small numbers of large files rather well but itb immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity oft small files
I attempted to copy 50MB 1500l files 800 directories to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy Thats roughly 27Ksecond
Deleting the filesq was painful as well taking atw least 15 minutes to delete everything
For kicks I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive andr was able to copy the sameg set of files to ite in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds
Bottom line is dont be fooled by the drives small physical size large capacity and price point it simply doesnt performv
I wanted tob replacep a Lexar 1GB with this but Ill keep looking
I used it to transfer ak 700MB 2300 file My Documents folder to a new PC
The transfer seemed pretty slow but deleting those files from the Sandisk took 61 minutes Back it goes
Product MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
11132006 0751 amx whent will ig get myz repaired or replaced item
You have had thisk for 1 week without notifyingz med of the status
Please respond by the way Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
1113 Still waiting for an updatej on the M240 you received on 113
I bought this stereo becauset of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had auxe inputs for me tol hook up my mp3 player to ity
thei first unit I received would not turn on at all
ik contactedw Philips techo supportg and their solution was for me to send theo brand new defective stereo back to them atq my expense
Fortunately Amazon has a very nice return policy and ib sent it backi to them instead
Amazon wasl also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unitx
The replacement stereoy arrived in short order and I was immediately disappointed in the sound qualityv which didnt seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing
After listeninga to the stereo for a fewe days and comparing it to a Sony CMTNE3 bookshelf stereo that I own here are my thoughtsp
Both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length
The Philips stereo however wouldf hiss and crackle as I moved around the room my body interfered with the reception
Playing the same song sidebyside one the two stereos I found that the Philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the CMTNE3
The Sony system had a much fuller andp richer sound quality
Also there seemed to be significant distortion in the highfrequencies onj the Philips stereoh making S sounds sound more liket H sounds
I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in thec overallw soundc possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input
The ergonomics of thep Philips stereo are nota so good
For one thing the stereo will easily tipg over forwards if accidentally bumped
If that happens the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove
The electronically actuated CD door is muchu more likely toy break than a passive mechanical door likew the toploading CMTNE3
thep volume goes up to 31 or so butq 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening
This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels which is rather limiting
Finally the stereo isx a bit bigger than I was expecting though I could have looked more closely at thel specs whenp buying it
I am in the process ofb returning this stereo and I will try to find a Sony system instead
Unfortunately Amazon no longer sells the CMTNE3 whichz I bought just about a year ago
I dontc understandi why electronicsw manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly
Is there reallyd that much innovation in bookshelf stereos The onlyj difference between thea Sony I bought lastv year and one I boughtr in 1989 is theb ability to play MP3 CDs
I have to rate thist product ande this companyr as horrible
Less than 300 hours onh it I called the company
It just blew againabout 700m hourshalf of what the life should be
Additionally the fan diedwhichs may be why the lampw blew
Maybe there was a problem with the fanc a year ago when it was STILL under warranty buti they wouldnt look atg it No
The projectorh was ceiling mounted and nevero moved since it was first put in place
The company keeps sayingIt is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
theyr will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product
I will get a new projectorI can buy a new one foru what they want to charger to maybe fix my current one
My new projector WILL NOTWILL NEVER be an Infocus product
Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
I emailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not havem my projector
my projector stopped workingw I have givenf up on it being repaired it was under warranty and amk now
struggling to get it back so that I can repair itu out of my own pocket
the Better businessx Bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactoryw due to unanswered complaints
I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewersl Ive found that they run out of juice incredibly fast
Im amazed that others reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AAs ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automaticf sprinkler time that uses two AAs lastedd only a week
Be warned that these arent quite the bargain they may initially seem
The worst customer servicew I have everv experienced
The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect vikingb cheats
This was a great mouses for about the first year I owned
After one year is when all of the problems started
The mouse now loses connectione sproadically and sometimes it doesnt want toj connect at all
I have changed the battery quite a fewv times and that doesnt seem toz help
It is veryc tempremental andm ip have now givenp up and am shopping fori a replacement
So a word to them wise in my experience the mouse will work greatx for a while justf be prepared to replace it in a yearc or sox
It always freezes up halfm way though the download when transfering photos toq my computeri
0 but this product ish fundamentally flawedj and buggy
The Xpress functions dont workm properly andr whend used switchesw to different inputs each time
Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screenk so you have to look for thej buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers
I had no problems burning to theses discs its when I went back a fewn months later to these discs and found out that none ofw them work anymore
After further researchv I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thuso the DVDs have absolutelly no lifes to them my discs starteda dyingp after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it hash become
This is true for all the discs about 150 of thema
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best
I dont know that to bei truer due to the fact that them software that theya sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use
I have to buy anotheru software package to opperatee the product that had stated in the description that the software was included
If your going tob sell something false advertisement is not the way
You will beb surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same
This is my main problem the sound qualityr sucks compared to the competitionn out there
1 The speakers arej lightweight andf shoddily built
They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about
They are fairly light weight meaning very small magnets inn them
These are 3 way speakers for really goodp sound on the cheap speakers need to be 2 wayr
2 thet sound input consists of a headphone type jackc ini FRONT
3 itsn advertised as 320 watts which is meaningless since the speakersh suck
What goodi is a high power amp with crappy speakers
And in case you know some audio 320y watts is only twice as loudx as 32 watts log relationship
For some reason this is not even half as loud asr my 100 W receiver
4 No usert adjustable equalizer only presets possiblem
5 Can not connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping type of connections
6 The receiver sucks even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver
I concur with the other reviewer Death to sonyh Shame on them for taking consumers for a ridee
This company nowadaysk makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it Competively with the others meaning fat profit margins
Im so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases
They were great a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actualf cd case style holders inside that you pop out with your finger by pressing thee center
Somebody couldb have sat onw it anda it wouldve been fine
I mean seriously guysq is it really worth forkingv over to those greedye peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card
For your psp if the game is really important to you and you cant save it
Just press up on thez power switch real quick the screen will gog off
it will go on hold and next time you wan na play it again
andw hopefully if you did it right youll have the game right back in thez place you left it
The minor problem isx that the user manual claimsm the user ID is admin
Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should bei left blank to log in
The major problem is that ther unit only worksf for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network
Once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work finei for another twelve to 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs but I dont accept havinge a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure howb Microsoft was able to convince me it is okm for an OS to hang
I am a computer professional andw I had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering ity down and back up it never did work again ifa you buy one go through thep setup and ifq it doesnt work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON Dont waste your precious time trying to get a 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting yourq time
Finally Amazon likes to keep the good reviews towardb the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged
However YOU SHOULD PAY morep ATTENTION TO thek BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES
If the product is in fact good it wont have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it isp exceptional
However look up allg the bad reviews forh this product
They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with thisc productp
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it isb great to have the individual tankswhich is why I bought the thing but now the print head isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings ando use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problems is still there
The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to thez canon websitep they dont even acknowledge this printer ever existed
consumerk reports rates it a best buy but I disagree
Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthlessx to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera becausen the quality will notp be seen with this printer
I bought thea Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior tob the cannonl
five star ratings are from people that JUST bought this MP3
I bought the white 512 forl my son at the same time
Whith in 3 weeks my sons was no longer working at all he had it in his back pack and some how ita got crunched enough to never workc again I was not happy
Also in ak few monthst mine started toh havex issues
And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony
I accually removed the cover to the toggle and just moved the joy stick under it to change songs or volumev
I have done a lot of research thisf time and I will not buy another Sony
The hold button that isx part of this slidingr door never works iw find thee player dead in my gym bag all the time Apparently the door slides over a bit and the player will turn on FOR HOURS andh than you have a dead player
Maybe Sony should have given us a onoff button thank this would not happen Dont do it folks look into other options even my moms iPod nanod is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player
First off let mea state for the record that I only buyu Sony but I have to
advise you against thev purchase of the bean walkman
I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006 as I had purchasedy replacement
insurance andk was able to returnv it because it broke
It is hard to turne off andu the usby port cover always pops open not to mention the headphones
The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen iss invisiable
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesnt allow for more photos after only using 40mbi
I have tried to format the disk using thec camera and through Windows XP
Bad investment Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get ac refund or an exchange
ir have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
get about 50 rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasion
multiple CD RWs with critical material would NOT read one multiple computersu
You have to be very carefule takingh the cds out or it would fall apart
I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem
In October 2004 I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon
After I had taken 20 moret photos and reviewede I immediately found a few images corruptedc
format the CF before use there were alway corrupted images
I wonder if I can returnx the defect CF card and get a replacement from amazonw or from manufacturerb
I have recentlyu bought two spindles of thesed discs and my computer Imac w Intel chiphardly outdated simply doesnt recognize themlikek I never put in a disc att all
thej kicker isb that thisk spring I also ordered two spindles ofl these discs exactly the same as far as I can tell from which I burned one hundredq discs not a single faulty one for a freind overseas
I have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that thev issue is not the quality of thez discs
The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not send in MailinRebate
Even though I mailed itn in with the UPC barcodem SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode
How can iu resubmit whend they already have thee barcode
In my experience with SanDisk I got rebate back on one ofv two cards that I submitted soz you get mailin rebate 50 of the time with SanDisk
I think mailinrebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies
I bought this mouse eightj months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogethere
I really expectedq ab betterk product andr durabilityk from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for notebooksy and love it
This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made
It felt very light and flimsyg the definitionh of cheap plastic
Not just the construction but thel performance was terrible
It would work perfectly for abouti a half hour and then go on af break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes
Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one butq I wouldnt takel that chance again
ik wish I could give thise device ao worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate
I dow not like thist item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x
somethingh is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest outc there andz it isp ao 16x burner
So if you are looking for 16x do notu buy this one
Its been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512mbt Transflash card was shipped from EMARTBUY and I still have not received myo order
When I contacted EMARTCRAP all they could tell me was that it hadb been shipped
I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete
Your are better off paying a higherw price for betterm servicej
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit
The included software is a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98z second edition it stops responding quiter frequetly and you haved to unplug and plug the unit back in to geth it to respond again
This unit would be great if it came out 7y years agoo
I had no problems burningi to these discs its when I wentf back a few months laterd to thesef discs and found out that none ofr themp work anymore
afterm further research I foundk out that Memorex uses the cheapesta dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition ins you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warpedn physically it has become
This is true for all thed discs aboutp 150b of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS productr STRONLY ENOUGH
The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cdsdvds
I cant give a completez review of the product becauseh I only tried tou repairv 1 dvd
How do I assignr a rating As several other people have experiencedh my unit is also DOA
I received it plugged it in pressed clean and the motor started up
I popped open the cover put in the disc I wanted cleaned and pressed clean again
Whats worse is the unit case is glued together no way toe openl it up to try to fix thes electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer
I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of mya favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a fews discs and ran them throughm all three processes without successful results
itj didnt seems to make much difference with any of my discs
I dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratchedt
My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of yourw CD or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
I purchased thisr flash card in June for my GPS memory
Card lost all its memory and was unable to take a new loadu
As withk some of the other reviewers mines stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighterv
I bought a vectort brand inverter at walmartj and it is much betterx
This item worked for a whilet but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time I restartedd my car
eventuallyt however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets
The product note only did not work but blew out fuses in my carb
The mechanic who checked myh car out said the devicet hadl a dead short in it
I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail
I willt notb purchase another thing from Amazon until myo money is refunded
aboutr a year agod I got one of thesea tot allowq me to playf DVDs foru my kids on myz laptop while travelling
It has anx alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately
I figurede that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs
Now that Im taking another trip I thought Id try it out in other cars
The thing is deadp doesnt do a thing when I plug it inb
Each time you replace the battery youb have to reload all of youry data
When this adapter first arrived I thought it was great
thed sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitterstylew adapter there are few open frequenciesh in the SF Bay areaz
The first day I used it for about 20 minutes totall didnt have far to drive ands it worked great
I didnt expect it to last forever butn less than an hour
yesw it has a 1 year warranty just sends the unit back with a money order 6 to cover the return postagex
Of course then youre spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit
I wasl so excited about how great this product worked whenr I gotg it
I had purchasedl the fmq transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since myj car had a tape deck I would give this a try
I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me BUT after less than a week it thed soundn started going down hill to a point where I couldnt listen anymore with it
myx guess is I will need a radio ing the cars that is ipodu compatiable cablel
noh kidding The shipping charge on these batteries was overy 6
Amazon doesnt itemize the shipping chargesd on your order so if you order multiple items you wont know that youre being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receiver does note conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itselfj is not very accurate
Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my homey id found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft hadn no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
I suspectq that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplishx much
Real irritatingu out ont the road as it is when youg find one of their printed atlass has been misbound and lacks several pages
theses Xtreme cd cases STINKsliterally I dont know whatf kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic but the smell is absolutely nauseous
ij kept itb for twoi weeks hoping the smell would go away
In theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these 2 for meu 1 forr a friend I cant say how his is doing but both of minek have faulty zippers making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractivenessi and compactness
Ive only got this thing to work foru about 3 hours and that is not in a row
Ive spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks
After MONTHS of emails and phone calls customer service responded
What a joke They told mej the plug in the unit and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in
Gim me a breakt ij shouldntt have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work
I was impressed withx thisd controller atq first and found it to feel comfortable ande work well
It was played with onceu and a while for about aa month total 10u hours max
Some time after that the next timen I went toh use it itm would only go left in a game that used the left joystick
I couldt not get it to center orv even stayj still it would just keep either steering thev car like burnout3u or whatever the left joystick would do forp the game no matter what
I tried it several times and it has nevere worked since
I fire it up once and a while to seel if its still doing it and it does
I am very dissapointed in this and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controllerb
I think I paid about 45 locally for it and I just boughtq a pelicanq Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for 19
99t that works and feelsk as good but is less than half the cost
I dont really feel like going thru a warrantyu claim if its even covered but ity still annoysr me every time I look at it in my Xbox drawero of extra stuff
I was going tok go totally wireless 4 units and luckilyg didnt run out ande buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers
I instead bought some extraq Microsoft sv controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllersm out there
If the Pelican holds up model PL2050 version 2
0 I mightv go get some more ifp I can find them locallyv
I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feelm it
I mean it works well for maybe likew ap week or two in that time you love it
but after a monthy its breaks downp and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with
The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoymentf
Im just playing halo 2 and out of nowherew my finger isnt on the grenade trigger and ir justo threw a grenade
Occasionally ity disconnects from its receiver whichi makes it useless until you push the connect buttonl ony the receiver
After the contoller started breaking down i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller andd it was a breath of fresh air
I bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide someu insulation fromt the heat when itsk on my lap sitting in a chair
Im very satisfied with its being able tou accomplish thata
HOWEVER the cord ended up breaking after ad few months
Targus replaced it atb no chargew which is good but still ad hasslen
Now one of the twob fans has started making a racket when it first turn it on
afterb a bitn it settles down but very noisy at first
The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40z years
It lights up just fine and it is a reassuring ledp gold but it refuses to do anythinge with my xd card
It worked just fine for 34 days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable
The DVDs are a ripoff although Im counting on the REBATE to at least break even not countingl my time
Even afterx extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring myp regionalization wase not an issue
Just a poor product Velocity ought to be ashamed
Id recommend Verbatims DVDR DL product made in Singapore
As a note I can get other dvdrsz to work justd fine
I havent submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of otherb negative rebate comments
I triedj 4 DVDs with different DVD writersa andl still doesntl work
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader
I triedt hard tryingw not to break the card no success
May be becausee my card was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12in1u SanDisk Reader
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service iq got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load musicm to make it not even playh
I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America Minneapolis MN and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it
Gee thanksp Ill be looking at another brand Apple stinks
Maybe if these were high endy rechargable NiMH this would beb a reasonable price
But for Alkaline This is evenj more ridiculus than the cablesj theyo sell
You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
As you canp see from the other reviews the speed on thisf thing is patheticf almost to the point of nonfunctional when it comes to many small files
I had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folder
makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing
512MB Mini 256MB Mini before I bought this product
Performance wise this particular product is not doing good
Its taking long time to copy files fromw my computers
Even its taking long time to delete files from this disk
So I returnedz to Amazon and lookingr for Mini products from SanDisk
I doubt alls the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB
Now Im planning to buy 512mbr or 1GB SanDisk Mini usbr flash drive
Better buy some good one than wasting your time on thiso product
A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons
Product MP3 Players Sansa m200q seriesa sansaa m240
11132006 0751 am When will I get my repaired or replaced itemx
youa have had this fors 1 week without notifying me of theu statusx
Please respond by the way appleu turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
1113w Still waitingw for an update on the M240 youk received on 113
No where near as easy to use as my old system But withi trial and error can have a decent amount of controle over your Projects
But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier
is that regardless of with systeml you use these labels can alter
the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wonderingq if its the disksburner or what
confirm that it was actually the labels I wasv having so much fun makingh
It might bew the weight but i thinkz its possibly the way the beam shines throughu the disc and reflects off the white label backing
dunnox but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
I connected allk the cables asl instructed but it doesnt work the light is not on
These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card
There isy nothing wrong with the card inm terms of capacitya or qualityt
I have givenk a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible withp cameras supporting Write Acceleration
Very Few camera supportt this technologyk and one can easily get the same capacity 12x at 14 the mentioned price
SO why pay more if youri camera does not support this technology
Its not something you can just throw away if it decidesn tom stop working
Delivery was great only tookq them a coupley ofd days
The connector to the cpen wask for some reason cutq in half
Without it you cant recharge or connect the cpen to thed pc
im called their main office all the way inx Sweden during the office hours
I dont care if the product itself is greatIll never know now will I
If youre unable tof receive support when you need em youre screwed
If youre just interestedm in electronic equipmentsp just want to try things outm and dont really care if youre on youru own go ahead and try it
Otherwise buy a product that you canf trustb on with respect to aftersales support
I have to rate this product and this company as horrible
Less than 300 hours on it I called the company
It justj blew againabout 700 hourshalf ofx what the life should be
Additionally the fan diedwhich may be why the lamp blew
Maybe there was a problemc withs the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranty butl they wouldnt look at it not
The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place
The companyw keepsg sayingIt is out of warranty sometimesk this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product
I will get a new projectorI can buy a new one forf what they want to charge to maybe fix my currentn one
myc new projector WILL NOTWILL NEVER be an Infocus product
Their service is overpriced and their technical support andv customere service is nothing more than dronesq citing manuals and warranties
The worst customer service I have ever experienced
The lady whoe alledged to be the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brandsa what elsep do you expect Viking cheats
thisf item wasx promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera but was never delivered
Now Amazon wants meu to review it so here your are
This ish a good product sounds great gets good battery lifef everything youd hope for in an iPod dock
The iPod docking port is really flimsy and hasz no structural support aside from thek actualw electronics themselves
After a littlez bit ofo use the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated tou the point that the volumeb fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out allu together
If theyt added somez kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldntr stress the electronics Id give this thing 5 stars
But without that it simply breaks quickly and nox longerj performs its onlyg job to sound good
Luckily I didnt pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr
which worked everyn time and I always end up using it insteadk
It has morel than paid for itself in repaired CDs20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with sparee sanding discsd andq the whole shebang
The motorized version didnt comer with anyz deep scratch sanding pads whichw I need about 25 of the time for a badly scratched disc
Most of the time then automatic sensor failss to detect that a disc is even in the machine and wont start turning so I have toc squeeze it togetherl to make it work
One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel button and it did not work straight outi of the box
Beyond that setting itz up takes time butn is not difficulta
I am just going toi wait and see about the next model that comes out
I havee six devices connected toq my HD television set
The softwarec depends on the userz assigning positions to the various inputsa to the TV and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when I used theg remote
I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly
At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver atw a certain time during thej day to record to Replay TV which can not turn the TV on and off
I have two NiMH chargers anda sony batteries wont chargea in them
They probably use some proprietary technology to preventm using other brand chargers
They force you to buy their own nonstandard charger that probably wont again chargew other brand batteries
Dont waste your money or support Sonys attempt to bring nonstandard products into a standardized market
Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the goodb old times when just one wasx enough
Once again Im amazed at how the reviews were so highlys in favor of this product
These areh terribly uncomfortable for myl ears andq dontz really provide that great of listening experience
The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds and thent they becomec distractingly uncomfortable
But of course this is just my experienceq your mileage may vary as they say
Personally I found my Apple iPod phones to be better
My two rear speakersk just stop workingj and also my
I donte have any other rear speakersm tob try on the system
while the verbatim has burned well in 100 of my recordings they fail to operate in ats least 24 different dvd players
ii had no problems burning to these discs its wheni I went back aa few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
After furtherh research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no lifen to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This isp true for all the discs about 150k of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND thisz PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
This media did not work on my brand new asus burner even afterr updating the firmware
Can captures analog video and produce cdroms but I expected the ability to produce dvdv
Instead buy the ADS DVDXpress dx2v for a bit more
Uleads software is stable and its not a trial version
It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture
Pinnacles Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy
I got sucked into this deal about a yearg ago and can say long term risky cells
It could be because the clock drawsw even when the radio partn is off but Im
If these were free id still would not recommend them due to all thez time thatm you will waste with faulty recordings
It is the discs id must assume since my burner works fine with other brands
Anyway now I think its best to invest a bit more and get good media
I have owned five of these UPS unitsx over the pastl four years
Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit
Currently only ONE still worksv I have very infrequent power outagesr perhaps three in ther past four years
These units work well to allow you to save your work and shutr down
My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inchh LCD
I cant comment on other UPS brands such as belkiny but I have seen many competing brands ond the web and at the computer stores
There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may bea aa reflection of APCs popularity ratherm than the poor reliability of their brand
My experience over the past four years has been mixedm
These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide hows precious your data becomes
If youk really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear
I chose to switchd to high quality surge suppressors and nevery work during potential storms
Many users do not have thatr flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance
The units I puchased were identical and only one unit isd still operational after four years
I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failedl and alarms beepedg until I bought new batteries
Prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor
Battery life depends on many factors so I dontq begrudge APC fors wear and tear on the battery but tow have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable
I bought APC branded batteries and cant explain why thed recurrent failuresx
Im frustated withk my APC products but it may be ai problem with this model
justi beware of the hiddenh costsk of battery replacement when purchasingl an UPS
I had this card fori morem than 6 months and It worked super in myj Canon Powershot A510
thenn all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting card error on my computera and digital camera a week ago
My SDUSB convertery couldnt find the card either
I had really good photos it wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good
I purchasedb this Boombox overl a year andb a half ago
What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback
It wouldq be nicem to bej able to rewind from theu first tog the last
You can noth rewindfast forward ind the song in Mp3 format but youe can do it with a regular audio cdg
sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a songp again buti I will have to play the entire song again
I no longerg havek the remotem and there are some things that I can not do anymore
This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place
The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to usez the hold feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off
The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between thee silicon cover and the ipod
I bought itw because it iss one of the only ipod accessories that hask a fair pricea tag
I think Ill just get it overs with and buyv one of the more expensive options
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustration and wasted time will occur until youa somehow find out thats the user ID should be left blank to log in
The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before itg has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it loosesi the connectionv to the wireless network
Once you unplugx andc plug back the power cord it will work fine for anotherp twelve to 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs but I dont accept having av Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang
I ordered the 2year service plan on May 1st this day julyi 31stm I still have not recieviede itv
I have contacted them a numberb of times andy still nothing
it purchased this itemz and one month later I still have not received any paperwork
This is ae complete wastes of money for a number of reasons
This hub will not workz with anys USB powered devices
So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub
Be awaren that if you want tog connect your printer scanner ipod etc
i purchasede the DLO action jacket neoprene for 20 40GB ipods for my wife fory use on walks etcq around town
The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipods doesnt
The plasic partp covering the ipod is awkward and doesnt align either soh you cant press the playw button
So since the ipod doesntw fit in the case overall this product is useless
pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to havex the individual tankswhich is why I bought the thingq but nowu thee print head isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanksb up and the problem is still thereb
The pages have splotchye black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canon website they dont even acknowledge this printer ever existed
I suffered with thisj clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive
Even on thev lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looksk like an alien spaceship is landing in the room
The sound is soso and itu has no battery backup lose power for a second and you havei to reset everthing
It is also very big taking up 12 my nightstand
The final straw was that it hasq trouble tuning inu even the strongest radio stations where I live
This morning I finally gave in accepted reality and tossed it in the trash
We bought thisn clockz radio got it home set itn up realized thats it didnt haven battery backq upt called Sony only to find out that they do notd find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to theirf representative at the customer service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay notg to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in havingu anl alarm clock if you cant trust that it will indeed wake you up
I wouldr like to believe that this hub works well but I wouldnt know
I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into myd powermac
I hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happenedo
I called targusl and they said I needed an ac adaptor
It doesnt comeb with one and doesnt say anything about one in thep manual or instructions or their website
They said I could get it atr radio shack and gave me the info 5u volt 2
Ive beenn to two radiox shacks and online they dont carry it
I had to sendh this item back because it stopped playing cds
The sound quality was good but the dependability of this item is questionable
Good thing first efficient ona batteryconvenient and compact
doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge
As most of the other reviewers have said thisc product isu absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in sonyr
I develop software for a living andp I am not afraid to use new software
even though I wasi able to use the softwares the main drawbackso are the overu smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy
I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this playerz from my computer
I was kind of thankful that I had savedg atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman
Atleast allb the hours I spent in transfering did not go wasteh
As soon asn I fixed thew new HDD and triedl to transfer the songs back to my computer
the useless sony softwre will not takei the music files back
I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me ad very indifferent group of people
It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of moneyw
Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont wantz to go abt that
I have an iriverz T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners haved always expected
First of all the shippingz on thisx item costsh more than the item itself
I did get itw quickly 2 or 3 days but I had several problems withu it
1 in repeatedly tried it on myg DVD player and the player hung
Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond
I tried overb 10 times and got the same result eachf time
2 I tried it on dvds drive 1 on my computer and it hungv as well
Had to CtrlAltDel to get my DVD player software to close
3 I repeatedly tried it on DVD drivey 2 on my computer
It is difficult not to break them whenw firstn trying to open them
On the flip side once they have been opened once they dont reclose very well
I have used DVD RW and CD RW memorext disks onl multiple computersk andz DVD recordersv
getj aboutz 50 rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasion
multiple CD rwsm with critical material would NOT read on multiple computersm
The labels are great and the spring devicew that isl used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful
There isc no direct Macintosh program rather there are templates
They were written for old versions of software and really dont workw right
thew Windows side includes an actual Print shopstylej program which works awfully
If you do getw this make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint
I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex shame on you
after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement
of course you want a hard copy that is why you bought it
really not in the business to fix things but toz make money notk fixing things
If you had anythingz to do with the device not working e
you dropped it forgetj about it theyt aintu gon na fixreplace it whatever
They have a very sparces network of repair companies soi if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship itl to them inv Virginiaof course you have to pay forp the shipping
Lastly they tendk to screw over their repair companies so in some casesx they will refuse to repair items covered under an N
W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since theyn know N
W will take months to pay them for thee work they did
If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
will waste your timex money and your every last nerve before repairingm your product
Eventually they will bute notv without an exhausting protracted fight
Im not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty someoddc dollars and was handed a coupon for a 40 rebate
But I wish that someone had informed me before ix lugged it all the way home that when you sing into they mic your voice doesnt come through the speaker
Im cool with the machines sound qualitym when it comes to playing a cdgc
If I tap theo micz I can hear an extremely faintc thud so I know its on but the volumes too lowand yes I adjusted the mic controlsif you want to sing alongo
Which makes this a dinosaurl a boom box in the age of the iPod
Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadnt been opened
Also occationally I use a card reader SimpleTech to writeread that card to transferx some big files between computers
Its all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half fully and after a card reader reading I gotm CF card error on my camera
Fortunately after I delete a few pictures I could move on
I gave the cardp to other people so I dont know how its doing now
After thate I purchased another Viking 512MB half year ago
ij used it to transfer filesc for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet
Now I am getting consistent cfa card error message on my camera even after reformat for severalv times while I dont have thatl problem if I use another card
One theory I heards was that a card reader may damagex a card
anywayy I will have to buy another card now and it wont be viking for thisz time
They gave me a number for return and I mailed back myi damaged CF carda
They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt
I bought the fifty pack and had 12j good burns and 38 coasters
I subsequently boughtx verbatim data life and have burnedn 14 so far with no coasters
I bought these discsg at CompUSA because I neededo a few before ih gotn the ones iz ordered online
Well I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled withi these discs making coasters
Maybe my burnersn dont like them but whatever the case I wont buy them ever again
I bought this mouse eight months ago andy was quite satisfied until last week when it stoppedc functioning altogethert
I really expected a better product and durability fromx Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech vxf Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
Being a graduatep student and living in an apartment I wasj hoping toh find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off courseo materialss and assignments
50100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over 20e which is high considering how often you need to buy themw
The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specifiede condition
I use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq
It takes foreverb tob copyr anything to and from it
Bought this a monthb ago for use with my DX4330 kodakn 3MP digital camera
After thatu everytime I ons the camerat it wanted me too reformat them cardWTH is that
Im always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon
One mistake I madeI threw away the shippingr and product packages once I tested out the card thoughte It worked and It would be OK
Needless to sayimu too over confident withw LEXARs productsg
I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media software etc
Id been using Ridata for some time w next to no coastersl but figuredf Id upgrade andu go with memorex this time around
I have had to recopy at leasto 5 out of them last dozen or so movies iveq done
wereq it a compatibility issue I could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media
I bought the adsc upconverter becausem I bought a HDTV onlyz to find out that my cable co
didnt offer hdtvu and after 3 failed attemptsz to switch to a satellite provider that did offer hdtve too many trees around my house
I wasntq expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazingm HDTV picture but for 550 I was expectingc the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable
When I first turned in on I askeds my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought
She looked at the TV and said okay imn ready turn it on
I saidy quotit IS ONquot This is pretty much the reaction I had alsox when I looked at it
The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different but thats all it was different
ini factg in some instances I though the picture was worse
I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for evenh thoughx thats not what I got itd for
So I did and to be honest iq reallya preferred the picture I got directly from my dvdr over the pictureo I gotg after running it thru the upconverter
itd didnt matter what display format I put it in it just didnt do anything to improve the picture
If you cant get HDTV dont expecto this box to give you anything close to the next best thing
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only goodz thing you can say about this unit
The included software is a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
thee tablet itselfh does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 secondx edition it stops responding quite frequetly andd you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again
This unit would bew great if it came out 7 years ago
I just recentlyq bought this and when I installed it Norton caughtk 2 viruses on the install CD
Out of the past 20 burns I have only had 10 DVDs burn successfully
I use Roxio CD Creator version 7 which does a great job with my cdsz so Im pretty suret itsk the DVD media
Not only am I wasting all my money butl my timek as well
Ive tried to lowery the burn speed but it does not matter
I ordered this on the recommendation of anotherk Amazon customer
iu though this would save me money because until then ih had been just buyingl new copies of my favorite cdsg that were scrathcedw up
I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make muchz difference with anyt of my discs
I dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestionu would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD orq DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on herem
Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but woulda neverr purchase this player again
It worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse theh change disc button with the eject button
I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it tof resetl and work correctly
Its now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time toq stop working
Bought it because it was cheapa and I guess I got what I paidb for
Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brandn
his I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006 and was able to set thev region code to 0 to watch all DVDs
After not usingh thef DVD Player for a fewm weeks and unplugging it the regionb code has automatically set back to 1 and I can not change it anymore What happened When I try to change it nowh I can only choose between the settings 1b and
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew thex fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter
I bought a Vector brand inverter at WalMart and it is much better
AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN ap REASONABLE TIME
THE itemd FAIL toy ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER receivedv THE GOOD
The sound was great but the DVD would lag every 1015 secondsq during any and all moviesl
This Philips HTS3400 dvdu has all the features I need but itsw mp3 player is reallyh bad Audio just popso before moving to a next song
It looks likea what Philips people just do in all of their electronics
I reallyd dont want to talk about this any more because William R
When I first heard aboutr this board I was incredibly excited
I have been playing BF2 Battlefield 2 for almoste a yearl now and still continually find myself stumbling overg the keys
So it wasj a godsend to be able ton purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game
The interchangable keysets for different games and applicationsw is quite intriguing the first that I have seen
But the pricei for each is kind ofi highr butc well worth it
The board is constructed well but dont expecth this to replace youro homeg keyboard
The Windows Keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any runofthemill keyboard but ity is awkward to type withd I might be biasedl since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard
Ingame typing is difficult at best with the gaming keysets
With mostq of the gaming keysets thed keys on the left 12 of the keyboard are laid out liker your homet keyboard but on the right 12 side theyx are all vertical not staggered
like UJ and M keys are 90 degrees vertically ons topx of each other
whenr you push them down they dont bounce back as much
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board and the bf2l keysetg 9 keys went completely dead
I tried to reinstallg the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail
I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that iu havee a faulty base unit
DUH theyk are reviewing my warranty but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day
Maybe this post is premature but I dont think I am getting a new base unit
thew expression Great ideaw Bad executionp holds true here
Ideazon has too many issues not enough support staffm andt a website that doesnt do anything but lookf good
Sleek design superh user friendly sharp image and easily unlock to all region
Never had any problem loading or playing until last week
Went completelyb dead for nox reason in the middle ofe a movie
It wouldve been a greater product if it lived passk 1 year at leastr
The player stopped working afterz only ah few monthso it would accept dvdsx but notn play themp and refuse to eject them
That behavior started out as intermittent but itp finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go
We had to takep the player apartl just to get the DVD out before throwing the player awayp in the trash
Our previous DVD playeri lasted over 5 years before it startede skipping
thisp one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste
Save your time and money and buy another machine
I would like to believe that this hub works well but I wouldntp know
I bought it to reduce clutter on my deskh from all my devices hooking into my powermac
I hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an ac adaptor
It doesnt come with onez and doesnt say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website
They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5g volt 2
Ive been to two radiob shacks and onlinek they dont carry it
I bought these thinking they were a good deal but now I have to agree with some of the otherp reviewers
I bought 24 of these and one year later I have four left that will take anyg sort of charger
The ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each
I also have several high end chargers that dont want anything to do with the ones that died
On thed bright side I have severalw Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digitalf camera and they have beeno A after 2 years
in purchased thesec batteries overt a year ago and only opened the pack now
These batteriesi will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries arei past their useful lives
I dont knowh what thew normal lifespan ofp rechargeable batteries is but these didnt last being on the shelf forh a little over a year
To be short the performance is less than greatc but OK buto I can live with thatc since I have dozens of them I dont care if it runs out faster
But what I couldnt stand if that it also set my charger on firew since one of them leaked I couldnt imagine what would happen if I didnt come to myy deskd in time
I bought this ask a travel charger for my Blackberry
iz followed instructions in the manual which are prettyj easy and charged up the Solio
After waiting twice as long as required I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it chargedbig mistake
Not only didt ity not charge a weird red battery icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed
I triedg this routine several times over several days with the samej result rereading the manual so manya times it was ridiculous
Finally I had enough and told the customer service for Solio thaty I was returning itk
noto only did they never return my money I had to call my CC company to handle it no one ever said what the problem could be
My advice Stay awayl from this thingiti may seen cool or environmentally friendly but it is junk a piece of overpriced junk
Musselman can add 2 morej cards to his connector problem
id have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna I plan to return it all
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all
I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many othersb withd the CD changer
Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while
It also hasu problems just changing to the next sequential CD
Apparently Sony didnt do proper quality testing on this product
I returned mine and after these other reviews wont be replacing it with a sonyy
But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken
I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchase but because this unit is a Sony I trustedj it would be a superior producta
The problemsd I had in both units are the same onesz mentioned by other reviews whenh playing CDs in randomc mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs beforeb failing to load a CD and quitting
I followedj the advice of another reviewerk and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changer
The one I just bought has an analogue tuner and itf is extremelye hard to get any stationh other than the veryq highpowered pop andp around here country stations
The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial
it bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl myy husband decided to invest in a new digital cameraj andp a photoh printer
The digital camera still works greatthe printer is another matter
While thiss one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes
As we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink
Replacing every cartridgep at once will run you about 75 atm a time give or take a few
The gray ink is used up the quickest ande has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally
The main problem id have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink bute for onlyi about the first 5070 pictures
The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of registervery frustrating when youre printing out anyc pictures let alonea ones of your child
Yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is tom clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion
Every other time get us no resultsb and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to
In the long run I will not be buying aw photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store foro processing
Qualitywise its gets you in the beginning but doesnta hold out forj theg long runb
My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas presentf for me
I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week
Photos had extreme amount ofg yellow in them such as yellow faces and hands no proper fleshm tones
I call HP support and was told that my printer was outg of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured not thei purchase date
I was offered one free call but my call was interruptedd because ofn an appointmenth that I had
I was given a case number but when I called HP back stating my case number they said that this was no longer a free call
I explained it was an extension of the first call but they refused to work with me
I think HP warranty policy stinks and would not purchase another HP product ask long as this policy stands
But when it is recordingz forget about changingb channels
It is really really slow and takes like forevere to even receive any remote clicks
Broadband feature is nice but USB doesnt come cheap
A clock radio that you havej tok fumble for a remote to usec
I have the older models CD Clock Radio and they are nice but the new model ise irritatingj
I also have the ipodn player and at least the volume controls are on the system
I cant keepr a system that I have to locate a remote to operate
ik PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES HOWEVER IT SEEMS tog BE veryo WEEK
I AM A DOUBLE amputeem AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR
I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND justf LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT reccomendx THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE
cobraq WAS thex TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS happenedq TO THE QUALITY
This carrying case worked well for me until I jumpedp in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped rightc off of it causing my iPod to falln to the pavement
It turns out the clipp isnt fastened on all that securely
After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up id still cant get more than a 20db signall from my guitar
Installed it easily but once every few days my systeme crashesm or I get a blue screen
I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasnt been tested on dellg machines and isd configured to work on generic computers only I wouldnt recommend this memory for dellv 700m users
Huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily
This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP in order forq it to stay visablel to your computers
secondd problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds arek very rare and even at 35feet from the AP the unit is around 1136mpbs
Do not buy thisc product find another company who stands behind there products
All of myy contacts with them have landed meb somewhereh inh India
People on the phone dont know how to help you and email supportb is a jokeu
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems witha
Often when I turn it on it hasb lines going across the screenz and hasa to be turned off andu then on again to get rid of them
Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems
ip evens sent it to them atj one point and they sent it back ing exactly the same condition I sentk it to them
After my experienceh with this Palm I will never buy Palm againl
This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over
We thought it was the battery going bad buto a new battery didnt help
I amh not even going to botherv gettingv itq replacedc afteru reading the other reviews here
I havet had various WiFi networking solutions in myh home and office for several years
While some Linksys units have worked for mev more often I have found them undependable
In particular the WPS54GU2 set up fine but I almosto always had top cycle the power toa get it to work eachd time I printed
THIS iso THE thirdt ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR ofh themk I PURCHASED LAST YEAR Total JUNK
I boughtj this HD because my Lacie which had lasted over 5 years crashed on me finally
Out of the box this products looked great although it was very large and heavy
I immediately plugged it in to test itw and it came up however that was the one and only time that it booted
I tried several more times and it wouldnt boot up
VERY VERY scary whenh youc buy a new device to hold all you important data and it wont boot up out of the box
I dont know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked but I am not taking any chance on an defective HD andh my data
I purchased this and shipped tok US and finally hadq it delivered to indiat in gurgaon
Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone
I record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinaryk computer mike fork this
But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike
The gain was lower than the ordinary mike ita doesnt work at all without the battery but the sound is tiny ando totallyc unsatisfactoryl
Unfortunately sony doesnt have good servicev centres wholl entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks downv the drain
SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeareda with Vista upgrade save for the Windows startup music
ie thought this new sound cardo would bring my sounds back
Might have but it says notv compatible with Vista
are you serious I bought this a while agol toa see if ita was cool
It is a piece of junkf ux can barely get any channels and even if you do you can barely see themh and itq has loud static
if you want to watch it in your car you have toc cover it because the back light is too weekk
The item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sentx to me but that cost me another 40 bucks
I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised
oncec I gotq the tv up it is ok and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it upw asi it should for safety reasonsx but a 3rd person needs to hold them arm steady
I did find out there is another one that coulda have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks
I had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when I got a replacementz
Now it looks like I may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also
This whole thing with the mount and tv hasv been very frustrating
These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blankr media Ive everx encountered Theyre madez by CMC Magnetics well known as the worst media manufacturer in the worldo
But not only area theyv CMC Magnetics theyre the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics
The latest KProbe hangs when faceda with these forcing a hard reset
The latest Nero Burning ROM hangs when faced withz these forcing a hard reset
The program continues nonstopz to display waiting for media when I use these and an attempt to abort hangs Windows XP sp2b the same way it hangs Kprobe
Curiously the media IDs on these are exactly the samev as that on Philips LightScribe CDR media theyrej made by CMC Magnetics as well
However at least the philipsk areg recognized byf all my software andu hardware quite unlike the Verbatims
Thats why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worsti from cmcf Magnetics
The Philips arep no prize either but they performd minimally well
The ONLY thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling
But whats the point of labeling discsy you cant even RECOGNIZE let alone burnh
I had the exact same problemsl with thesef media in bothn my LiteOn LH201AH burner and my NEC ND2510A burner the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even lowqualityw media
Note that Verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden
But stupidly they chose to go ultracheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp
I founds this be very handy to have around to transfer largeu files between work and home but I expectedg it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of
Im glad I backf up my data ina more than one place
Do not be fooled by the flashy metalliclooking picture
thee plastic shell of this devicem ise the quality of McDonalds toys
One would think that for 300 the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did noto leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims duex to bad cuttingp
In order to turn the device onu you have to press very firmly which is ag risky thing tou do consideringk the cracking delicacy ofq the shell
The cable port for the DocuPen is alsoe extremely flimsy and youf have to hold the cable firmly in place ink order for the downloadsh toh take place otherwise the connection will be lost
I am am premedical student and I very stupidly invested a lot of moneyu in this product believing that I could for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk scan my science textbooks in the library including the coloredr diagrams and in that way I thoughtk I would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least 100 each
However I now see that thiss belief was naive to say the leastb
The words come out distorted like a jammed fax machine and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful foru annotating PDFs the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotatew
Furthermore downloadingu is very slowr ate least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer and since you cant see how your scans have turned outv until you load them intor the computer you will have to rescan about 80 of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibility
I wish I had readw some of the other negative Amazon reviews beforeo buyingj thisa product
ic woulds have saved myself a lot of money and timer
If youa are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a fewh flat documents then this product may work okay for you although a digitale camera will probably deliverz betterw results
If you haveb been harboring grandiose visions of going allout paperlessp with this product you will findu yourself extremely disappointed
Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semidecent shell manufacturuer it will not a good buy
The idea isu wonderful and has a lot ofd potentialc especially when coupled with a Tablet PC
However the executiony of the idea needsq improvement
I hope to see a far betterc version ofg this product in the next few years at a price that is comparable to quality
The paper is just heavyweight paper thats perforated so you can bend it and break outb thei inserts themselves
which takes some effortd not sure if itd be quicker juste getting heavyweight paper and using a paperu cutting boardq
Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious timed
No you cant make the template show rightside upg
to use thee software you have tos TILT YOUR headx SIDEWAYS
Im not kidding I guess you could alsod turn your monitor on its side
You can rotate the text so it shows the way it shouldj
sot youll have to turn yourt head or monitorj back and forth sideways
What kind of company would selle such a product
if youre looking for templates for the DVD insertsr
Another thing is that there isnt az hole for thek headphone jack which is rather odd
I was wrongly advised by techd support to buy this instead of waiting for a newh supply of power supplies from Voodoo
Be sure your computer is supported because targust tech wont givei you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you cant safely maake it work with an unsupportedb computer
I justg now read the other reviews and now consider myselff lucky I didnt keep it and try to make it work
After about 3 weeks of operation the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy
I boughtc this product as a wayy to keep a largep amount of backup data saved however I have fought with the drivers for days now
whenevery the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work if I tryl to use multipleu computers on the same drives it crashes even with the newest updates I will beo returning thisf product ASAP
Im veryo disappointed and will not be buy netgear again
This was my second Netgear producty is boughtu previously a wireless modem which I was only okayg with not impressedk The idea of a network storage appeals to me
In reading the previous reviews ir found that it was a finicky thingh and be careful on theb drives you buyc for it
wellk I searched and searched and foundh ab drive that worked and bought both yesterday
Tried to setk it up today and connecting the drive went prettys well but that is where everything started to go down hill
Midway through the install it tellsh you to okay any error messages which turn out toh be things like this is untested ons XP and might not work kind of errors and suddenly my computer reboots
Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well and it never goes back to the installb like most programs do whenp they require a reboot
startedv poking around and find out that not onlyl do you have to check the drivei you put in to the sc101u you need to look in to your own computer
To quote Netgears webo site SCSI diskt drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers
Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives
My computer is just a week oldn and has these newer drivers
Back in the box the SC101 goes andl I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me
Tried the 3 things when you haveu trouble it suggests and none work
This is where I get really frustrated Netgear support
I waited 35 minutesj for someone to pick up thev phone who ultimately toldj mee it was my own fault and Id have to payc to have that crp yes he said it from my system
I needed toz hire a local computerz vendor and it would be my bill
The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand and went through huge mood swings during the call from happy to argumentative to depressed to happy again
I was freaked that this person knew my home address
After reading up on it and now experiencing it I think it needs a ton more engineering anda refinement before it is brought to marketd
It really requires ay level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
everything works fine except for two flaws in Excel on theh numpad thet minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt keyt
this is unacceptable ib had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games
logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking productsm but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings
I livee in San Francisco and have generally good radio reception
This unit could not receive normal FM stations that table radios sitting righty next to it could pick up
and I used the fancy Dipole antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and thep other table radios only had an internal antenna
Sometimes the audio skips and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired meaning 3 or 4 secondu dropouts
I purchased the recepterv Radio HD a year ago used it for a weekend and returned it immediately
evens inz the Denver market with lots of very strong hdh signals this radio had troubleg finding them
Id be listening to a strong station and the radio would lose lock go silent and rebuffer before coming back to life
This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it
I have sinceo purchased a Sangean hdr1n andk love it
Tried thisb withe two different computers using Windows Vista
Got this message One of thev USB devices attached to thisy computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it
After onex successful printing it didnt work at all
This cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected
What more can I say than the above It is flimsy doesnt stay in adjustment rattles around when you move and looks cheap to boot
Tilting the foot rest back and forthv is not the easiest thing in the world
Its just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so itu sticks a lot
There are many aspects of the T5 people wante to count as negatives
For me I consider them annoyances buth not killers
I would likea to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it
More memory isb always good but the T5 isnt on the hurting side
Its notc aj good mp3k player with theh memory it has
And even if you have a 2G card with mp3s its not like this is what you would buy for MP3s
But as far as contact information on the go applications etc
The problem asj I haveb just found out is these arel known to die
I haventz heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die
It willc lock up andz evenn after all the resetsi listed from palmu it will not come back to even a factoryv state
You will have a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top
If you are under warranty youo can send itb back to palmf for them to make itk better
This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge youl for
Until I ran into thisw I would have rated this a 45
untila this happened them devicew did what I expected it to do
I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi
But it has one of the fastest processors available at that time in a PDA
works well enough I havent had any issues with it
You can surf the net with bluetooth so wifio isnt really that big of a deal
But if you cant trust youre device is going to be working the next day it really
I dont want to buy another Palm after thisr experience but I am not sure whatm to
First t5a lasted 6 months then just refused to start was replaced under warranty
This one locked up after about 3 months was replaced again under warranty
itss now out of warranty and wont start or reset
The firstz 2 times Palm told me the ROM had failed
I guess its the same problemq again but Im not spending 169v to get ity swapped for another faultyp T5
Out of the box I think its a good pdag soe check those 4 and 5 star reviews tou see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy
I bought this headset from retailer offline and returned it the next day
First off I have to make it clear thatq I had NO problemsi with sound
evend though the speakers could havef been just a tiny bit bigger they use 40mm drivers the sound qualityf of thed headset was just fine
However when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sin
The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal aroundn the ears and a bad seal on closedback headphones ultimately leadst to poor sound isolation
Also I have no idea what material they used fors the cup pads but it is nowhere near soft enougho
in fact iw litterally couldnt wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red flush from discomfort
Mind you I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either
but these things they just plain hurt to wear after ak very shortb period of time which isnt good at all
Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons forb the return
If your ears are tough you should have no problem with this headset
The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for youl
However if youre looking for comfort and good sound isolation youll want to look elsewhere
I dontn recommend these for 1st person shootern gamersu
impossiblef to tell if enemy is in front or behind you
Probably okq if direction of sound is not important to you
Left and right work ok but not frontrear for some reason
The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointlessw
On battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost
I boughtj this card and the Belkin prens wirelessm router inf Nov
Everytime they asked me to reinstall the driverss and software for the card but the card never worked
I wasted more thank 4 hours on phone and reinstallingk drivers again and again
Then finally Belkin asked me tof ship them the defective card to get a replacementh
I pointed out that I should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with butr Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs
I have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting aa replacement to arrive
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th
I wouldnte waste my time ordering this product from amazonx
THIS SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE inkc CARTRIDGE I needu
Dear sirmadamn itsr very difficult to email you regarding things I cant find
orx you dont sellt I am looking forr hpp blackk ink
Now you tell me which ink I need No way you can tell
Because you are NOT sellingj orn what You site is very difficult to find Ink I need
When the screen is black between scenes and what not their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference
Buy a different one this oneh is just notr up to the task
I opted notn to send it back when I reado the other feedback on this page
I didnt want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed as the other fellow did below
Amazon is usually prettyq good not this time andl not on this producti
Now Im stuck with a antenna I did not order nor do I want
This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyoner when we needed a humidifer with thep possiblea hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dads new tracheostomy
Problem is it puts out TOO much mist even at the loweste setting Weve tried everything includingx taping the hole but it then goesj from all to nothing because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through
Of course it wasnt until we starteds mentioning it to the various RNs that come tol take care of my dad that everyone using it for the same purpose complainsk of the same excessive mist problem
Ive resorted to making large hole cutsb in the plasticl tubingn leading up to my dads mask
Not a great way toe do it and just asking to be seeded by bacteria but ifa anyone has a better suggestion Im all for it even if it means suggesting a different humidifier
so Im paying 300 for a settop box with a 40Gb hard drive but I cant useu itu as a DVR Why not Also thef only content I cany play on this settop box is content that comes through iTunes Thats right
if it isnt in your iTunes library you can play it on thej appled TV
This meansc you caqn play your DVDs you cantt playb saved DVD iMovie or other movie files youz cant play anything unlesst it hasu been successfullyy added to your iTunes library
Also make surep you see thel fine print aboutb having ton have a widescreenh TV
If you dont have one you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame aboutq half them size of your screen it wont go to the edges and be borderless so you have a tiny window tok view inside ao large blackm box
Any pros It has to be the easiest setup I have ever experiencedp with an electronica item
also I thought it was really coll that with zero configuringb on my part it was able to communicatej perfectly with itunesw just becausej I pluggedd the Apple TV into myn Airport Extreme router that my computerg was also plugged into
I didnt think it would be that easy without havinge to configure something but it was
This will be a good product down the line when this will haveq a larger hard drive and DVR capability
Right nowk its time tow sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something betterg
if this had only cost me 100 ord 150 I would probably keep it however
The left palm pad keep peeling possibly fromy the uneven heat
This make the protection pad a lotn lessi usefulr than one would
The software on the pc side doesnt work well at all
Wont listj all my files andy I cant get it to update changesd or new folders
The remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies
It continues to blowt away anyr of the media players I have purchased
I read theo other reviews somes glowing others well
The pricec was rightz 149 50 rebate So iz thoughtl I would take a chance
I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself
First offv in am only interested ina playing videos from my computer so I have no idead how wellc the image viewing or MP3 playingq works
I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections
myh house is fully wired withc CAT5 therefore I am using this product wired not wireless
I was able to getp the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server withinv 10 minutes oft opening the cartonx
It found the tversity server right awayt and I was able to see the contentsu listed
Neither server tversity or the Dlink were smart enough tor viewl a folder of VOB files as a movie
So for example I clicked on my Casablanca folder ip would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie
When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes it didu not gor tod vob_2r
I needed to use the remote and manually select thef next item to play
As another review stated then FF simply does not work properly
Oh sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward
If you press play while the movie is FFwding the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB
This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device
Which I will be doing first thing in thet morning
My final advice to any prospective buyers S T A Y al W A Y
My final advic to DLink Great idea but your product absolutely sucks
Oh one more thing Someone mentioned thatg theirz tech support wasi very freindlyx
Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly their English was terrible
oh come on just one guess It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulders to one another
I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients
Which made itd very difficultk for the lady helping me
She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over
Sheesh ib must have read my phoney number to her at least 4 times before she got it right
One last interestingt tidbit on the packaging they mention Nero recode CE
Nero has ad list of Supported Media Players listed
I willu return this DLink junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead
I bow my head in shame As iq had read the reviews but I bought the product anywayy
It was a pain to configurey and then none of thev settings would stickp
Whenever I changed the default password it would never let me log back into the camerac without having to do a reset
Returning this item so I can getr something decent
bad customere servicei its been almost a month and i still have not received thise product
ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones
i dont even know how to rate the item because is dont have it
im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help
I put it into the cassette player inl myf car and the soundst were completely distorted
The voice constantly skips ands the casette sometimes clicks
The quality of sound inl my car ise usually amazing and basically theree was nos bass sound coming through my speakersn using this device
I plan on returning it if shipping doesnt costu more than the product itself
I have aw DCS900W camera that failed withinw a year
After that I made 7y calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced
obviouslyr I was talking tog some indian people overseas that dont seem to care about the service that much and usually after a couple of transfers the liner got cut off oro picked upd byl another layman
During conversation the line quality iso very bad
After a while I just decided that 100 camerak is not worth thex time of the calls
I am in the process ofn reporting their practice to the better business bureau
Based on my experience I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from DLink
oncei you have any problem they just wont honor the waranty
I was pretty disappointed with the Tune beltk because oft two main reasons
firsti I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber casen that I usually keep it in so thati it would fit inside the Tune Belt
That wasnt such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve
But then I went to wear it for ai runp and the armband was too small for my arm I have fairly developed bicepsg fromu years of weight trainingi butc nothing outrageous
I would have thoughtk that with a velcro strap there would have been enough ranges to accommodates most users
So if you have larger than average biceps say 17 amd up save your money
i bought myh monitor yesterday and found tos have a buzzing sound at lower brightness lt100s
aftery having installed theo unit fort 43 days the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting
This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit Flying veryj dangerous
Tomtom would not replace the unit asd the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks buyer beware
See the TomTom forum for description and picture
I ordered this television witht high hopesk knowing thatw despitec reports of firmware problemsd and other defects thatr I would luck out and save a bundle
Every sharpi Aquos LCD TV manufacturedu before April 1 2006 shipped with bad firmware
For mea it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turningo it on it turned itself off and nevers turned back on again
Resets systeme resets power cycling unplugging components didnt help
A search turned up threads on websites like avse forump withz otherm owners of Sharp TVs in thev D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power managemente problems almost immediately after purchase
For themu the fix was a visit to a sharpm authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV
I say a visit because Sharp does not cover inhouse technician visitsg for TVs under 32 a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 weeki for a tech visit that wouldi ultimately be canceled
soh here I am 10 days latern and hundreds of dollars poorer with noi tvn to showr for it
insteadp it sits at thez authorized service center becausec Sharp obviously does not vet itst service centers to make sure you get good servicev from them either
Im willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect iss selling atq fire sale prices were produced before 412006c
Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one
If it begins with a 501512 601 602 or 603 immediately demand a firmwared upgrade from Sharp 1800BESHARP regardless of whether or not youre experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully whilez Sharps warranty is still in effect for you
i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middlee of the screen ia sent it back and it has been 23 months i havent heard anythingm back whether they will replace it or give mep a credit
It was great for the first week then it made my computer crash and now I can not get it installed again
I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was ac good purchase
Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware software or other products like this one
Now havings problems with the product is one thing but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats
Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentionedx AFTER iq purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month
My mp3m player stopped working after 3 months I did get it to work again
Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems
OK so I download the drivers thate is supposed to fix the problem no go
Oh and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern europec at the time so its makes matters even better trying to get ahold of themb via phone
Save yourselfa some frustration and get somethings better
irivery maybe Just stay away from Creative Lab products
I bought this Mp3 player because it was justc a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended upx paying dearly for it
It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months
The firmware decidedf to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually thatm there wasv even anye music to listen to
Now I have a 200a dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PC
So if your intoz extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk thisx is a great product
Nice product before theyq decided to save a few pennies ie haven purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that wasx part ofz the atraction ofe this case note that the discription says sturdy padded handle NOT
5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you dont need one
no helpn fromm their support staff on phones nor online QA
I am a savvy computer type withe network experience and this one for the books
This productl has a knownn defect for serial numbers R641 and less see Logitech website
I justf received my Amazon Order and it was serial number R635
Hopefully Amazon will cleansew its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customerc baseh
These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones camem out
Voices areq muted highs are muddy and lows are nonexistant
The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as surround sound yeah right
they haveg an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephonej headset and still heari my callers
maybel mine was broken but I dont think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends
I connected the splitter to my soundq card a TB Montego DDL with a 1 cable and then tried both a 6 and 30 cable to my stereo
Both the 6 anda 30 cablesy delivered greatd clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card
iz evenv used only the 6 and 30 cables in case the 1 was bad
iu thinkz you need to have either a veryu very strongh signal from your source to use a passive splitter likex this one or use aq powered splitter
Cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic earcups but after a few months light use I lost sound through one cup then the other
In general when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surroundingf noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unith turnedr ono
The batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery I had in there lastedw longer than the unit itself
veryw disappointing but for the price this is hardly unexpected
I was happy with the noise canceling features not the best but definitely works
Great for airplane rides really helps cut out thats background engine noise
My problem however withp these headphones hwoever is the designl the firstj set i hadg brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus cheers to them
the second set broke too in a different place the deisgnj of these just isnt very sturdy
Im gentle with my stuff too so either I had bad luck wtwo defective units or theyre just not madeg well
It is almost impossible to getm a clear picture on anyh channel and the sound quality is poor
I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month
Amazon was great withb sending a replacement in just two days before even getting the original back
But the replacement model froze up afterv just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund
To quotey an email from Amazon regarding this product As itg seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than
we originally thought we are not able to send another replacement
If only I could get it to print Not to mention when I turn it on it makes a god awful soundo like some thingv is jammed
Ive tried over andl over to try to print something
Ive checked my options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printinge
If your looking for a portiblef printer you have other options and I suggest using them
I have not foundi any that even come close to meeting my needs
I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years andp anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks so DVDs is your only source of video entertainment
I have been trying to find a good case that holdk equal number of title books as it does DVDs
buti that seems to be asking to much or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly Then whenb you look ata the furniturem options everything seems toi be made for function and notg style at all they are generally pressboard P
I hope thatn some of the manufacturers readv this and come up with real solutions cause there is definately av market out there that is waiting toe be satisfied
This product will not fix your disc I triedc to fix a damaged CD andy it only made the problem worse
I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor
This is au poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work I wish someone would have toldw me this before I spent money on it
I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped itj 1
The unit has a very cheap feeln especially for the price
I wasntn ata all surprisedi when it stopped working
The PC softwarep that you use to customizen the touchscreen is crap
thev touchscreen is very tedious to customize I write software for a living and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen
I cant imagine the averageb consumer being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the softwared and to transfer the information from your PC to they remotex
The wholeu point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touch screen
Unless you are veryu comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unitp
Aside from the touchscreens fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the sizee of the remote
Did I mention the batteries did not last morer than 2j months In short this product isk crap
I might consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less
Whoever produced this software seemse to have missed theq point
There isa now point in havng one vpnp client on your machine that limits yous to just being able to use that one client
It would be similar to say allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet
In my case I already had two VPN clients related toa work when I installedj a Netgear router with VPN capabilitiesa on my home network
The VPN software fromb Netgear stops my other VPN clients working
Added to my woes I cant tell you how often I sawj thet blue screen of death during my repeated software installdeinstall efforts
I am now returning both the router andz the clientd software as this is an unusable solution
Like other userss have experienced this unit is no longer functional after 18 months
The wired base isi still working but the wireless range extender no longeri fires up all 3 led lights
A few months into the new year I dropped it onto pavement and it broke
For 99 Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit which I consider a fair price
Unfortunately the refurb unit couldnt play directions at full volume so I returned it for anothero refurb
This unit fell off the windshield still in its cradlev andg it started making that frying sound of shortl circuits
I calleda Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damageg to the unitx theyd look at it underw warranty
I had told the guy whatw happened so I was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it
Under allm circumstances the report you get back says the returned unit was within specifications or words to that effect even though clearly not
Units will be returned with new software keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to registerl even though you already have
For some the mapping software on the M3 will appearw crippledr
It does nota allow you to load waypoints Points of Interest and the like
On the first one every time I inserted thei SD card with maps Windows player or whatever its called would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes
The fourth one has a problem common to they first one The brightness resets itself randomly to zero
The first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness tot halfx ono but this one resets them both tor zero
So you may think the unit is not turning on butw its on
If yourel outside you can put it ini the sun and see dimly enough to navigate tox the brightness setting but ifd itsk dark you need a flashlight
thej current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lightery and sometimes when I put it in the cradleu
This means I have to do the full new user routine
Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen
Reset the time fromk Olathe Kansas to where I live
All contacts notes calendarsd and othero informationo is lost
After Ive gone througho the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and getw me where Im going but I cant load destinations froms contacts as theyre gone so I have to type them all in by hand
If the battery runs out of juice the unit is dead
It forgets everything and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen
Reset the time from Olathe Kansas to where I live
All contacts notes calendars and other information is lost
iz complained about thisj to support at Garmin and I was assured thisf is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about ita
theyq recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not beh lostj
So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data
I did learn thougha that if thea battery runs downd the backup program is lost so you cant retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save asn selfextracting archives
To restore I pop out the detailed maps SD cardc insert the backup card navigate to the File Explorer navigate to the sdy card open the contents of thee SD card select the latest backu up click through the restore procedure click to OK that it has finished just a minute or two with my small amount of data click to restart wait a longi time for it to restartn tap to get past the owner data screen enter the passwordf then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then Im good to go
I cantk do it while Im driving of course so if thee unit resets on itss own I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowingd where Home is which means I havee toj typez it or other locations into the Where To dialogue
The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up which isu confusing for me as I cant lookq at the screen and outy my window andl make immediate sensed ofv where I am visavis the map
imx sure this is my shortcoming and I then haves to remember how to navigate theq menuk to the setting for northa is up which I cant do while driving
It also defaults to different displays for day and night
The night display usesq a dark background and iz have found that the menus for the Windows programs use aq transparent background with black text
So I cant read the menus selections against the darks display
And the unit willm not save my preference forq using dayy at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when iz start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle
On thec contacts database the unit assumes all phone numbers startq with the area code to Olathe Kansas
iw haven a few overseas numbersy and they are crammed into the xxx xxxxxxx format even though they are longer and dont start witha an areab code
In the calendar if I have meetings scheduledt outside my time zone I enterf them at they time theyre scheduled
Then when I get there I have the option of choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone
So it never use thec visitedj time zone feature and the unit assumes Im still in my home zone wherever I may travel
ik have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address but for which iq have the latlong coordinates
ie camp in places that are off main roads and tryingr to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom outs which loses the roado
ond the whole the directions part ofq the M3 is excellent
It gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you findm stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses andv phone numbers so you can call ahead for information andy reservations
On the whole using the devicel is too aggravating to make it a keeper
After a year of use I cant put up with it anymore
illq take Garmins word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows mobilet and not Garmins fault but I cant put up with it anymore
Ill switch to Magellan or TomTom or somen other unit that isnt Windowsbased and that doesnt completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesnt randomly do a hard reset doesnt randomly set the brightness to zeros and doesnt assume all phone numbers start with the areag code to Olathe Kansas
Maybe another manufacturer will let me import poism and waypoints from other peoples files
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I have Directv with HD 5 LNB and the signal wasd low
Signal was less thanl 60q for some ofi the transponder signals which caused a choppyd picture or no picture while watching HD
The signal strengthy wasnt improved on the non HD receivers that ij have as well
It didnt matter where I putn them in relationf to the dish and receiver
However I wast removing the plastic tips which need to ber changed every several months and the headphones broke
The company has only a oneyear warranty so I was outofluck
Again I thought the sounds was great but for this price I would expect them to be more durable
Also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times
Just received radio yesterday and am returning radioh today Pluses
adequate LCD display andk good illumination while on AC adapter
However the volume slew buttons haveg set numbered volume levels and betweene settings of 56 there is a BIG noticeable increase in volumenot good and while tuning shortwaveo bands every approx 100Khz incrementk there appears to beh a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speaker
Also on FM if hands are near the radio the signal breaks upfor weaker signals not strong ones and compared to my grundigi 400PE which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome thej Eton E5 seems worse stillf I am returning this today and obtainingb the Sony 7600GR instead
Eton E5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if comparing it to another similar size radio and then comparing it to my Sony 2010
After about 3 months ofx light use it is stuck in 45 rpm mode
I sometimes usev myc thumb top slowd down the player to 33 rpm mode
Dont buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning garbage in which caseg this is right your alley the Garbage Alley
I wouldnt even givej this to a bum because I would feel bad about its
After buying this product I opened the case after few days as I was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices
However everyl time I put it in the camerax or other devicesy it gives error and doesnt work
I couldntn use this memoryf stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receiptI am not sureg how I can even return it back either
basicallyv not at all happy with the product at thisz time
The light makes my computer very sluggish even when my laptop isl not running off of the batteryn
Browsing the internet especially is painfully slow and I amc on aq highspeed cable connection
After owningw a Ptouch labeler for yearsI found the needl for aw more duableg label thani my M tape was providing
What a mistake The only thing well designed about this unit is its abilty to waste more tape than it uses If you print a label of any sizecount on it costing you two full inchest of tape to do it At 20x
00 a rollprepare to be screwed each timez you push the print button
Then go find the scissors and cut the excess offso the label does not look as stupid as the person whoa designed this pile of junk But cheer up you canl pushq six buttonsevery timetoy reduce the margin to narrow
This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE sidek of the labeland printd two small dots on the otherb sidethis will show you where to cut it with yourh scissorsto match the narrow side
alsoz you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY timeAnother great featureit will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print sizeso you will only print large print
I used tob make lots of labelsand now I only make labels for VERY important items
And only when I am up to getting mad for doingh so
I really wisha amazon would allow us to give items a negative fivem stars You have been warned
While thep phone is pretty easy to use and has nicex features Ive especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsetsz weve found it to be extremely unreliableh
the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months ofi use
the handsets go out of range when one takes them only a modest distance from the base even though we have the basep in the middle of our house the handsets dont workc at the ends and our house is not that bigv
thet handsets randomly become unregisteredv from the base and havef to be reset this hasb only become a problem in the past month
The issues weve had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone usually wed expect such a purchasem to last longer than two years
I bought this phone for the great features and because Ive had good luck with other Motorola products
The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but thata is about the only redeeming quality that they have
The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit
The only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the powerg to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings
Range on the handsets is onlyl mediocre I cant talk in the far corners of the house even with theo base centrally located
Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend notu buying them
Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout house becauser Patricia wife in wheelchair and ony oxygen 247
She could beep all phoness in emergency and I would hear
First sound terrible second after 1 month most phones good forq less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls third phonesd quite often in searching mode when picked upx for use
Entered house to findd wifeu unconcious and not breathing
SEARCHING Stopped CPR and ran to another room for different brand phone and called 911
Patricia DIED in spite of my and 911q personnels effortsa
lookingp for someone I hate to give these 5 phonesx my last Motorola product
There should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion forg buying both pieces
The page from which I ordered both pieces was unclear and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer
I had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player
I knowt Ill be refunded the price of the first changer
But by then the promotiong they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished
I received the reals changer a few days later but lost the speakers
I think Amazon owes men the speakers which is whats the bad page made me miss
In generalg Ive been happy with Belkin accessories but thisx cable is the pitsa
It lasted less than a month I used it to connect my HDDVR cable box to myq receiver
No crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days myx audioy went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent
I dont like to supportq the Monster Cable hype but because of their lifetime warrantyw I bought their cable to replace this one
After using these radios two months iv can sayr that battery life is poor
Perhaps my batteries didnt come in good condition
10i mile range is not truez in a normal environment openw sea or desert perhaps
After receiving this DRUM which was listed as having a 25000 yieldl capacity on 121106
Today 11507 my printer is giving me the sameu error message DRUM NEAR END There was no indication when iu purchased this product that it would be refurbished
The transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter whatg you do
I knew better but I did it anyway thinking thatv it would be au good compromise wes have IBM dellz and toshibab laptops and a Sony Really Nice Monitor
No modemi port not a surprise but would have been nice the video display is well you can seel stuff on the monitor
The mouse runs on a delay of 12 seconds and is unacceptable
I switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected
I tried 3 of these DVDRs none of them worked errors in every burno
ix used another brand to burnh the session and it worked perfectly so it is definately a problem with these DVDRs and not with my burner
ive come to expect a decent level ofq quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouseg
the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface and i mean veryl slight or on one that is too shinyn the laser wont track right
i had to open the thing upz and shave down part ofj the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didnt test it well enough
unless your willing to doe that skip this one it is not of the same quality as the firstn generation microsofty optical mice
i know everyone is doing what they can tom cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul
typical Shouldnt have bought a generic memory Serves me right Anyway
I purchased this product and couldnt get it to work on a PC laptop or pda cingular 8125
Not onlyd does it nots registerk in any SDMiniSD cards reader but the craftsmanship appears tou be suspect as well
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD one fewer thing to carryb
Well about six months after opening this item I noticed that myz iPOD was running on battery
oneh of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore
I am disappointed but shouldz have expected that for then 10 I spent
The principal benefit of this producto isc in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first takingv a good look at theu product reviews
I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call
Ive decided to cut my losses and buy a different card
Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considereda normal wear and mousing surface was dificult to cleanc it hold onto thes dirt withf its textured surface
I just couldnt suggest anyone else spent 15 on a mousepad thatn isntk going to lastv them
I put thisg covert on immediately after I opened my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratch
Ive never hadp my iPod without the covers onk ith and havel had it 3 weeks
ik now have an iPod covered withk distracting scratches on the screenm
Have a second Generation ipod If so this isy not the product forb you
afteru buying my new greenh ipod I neededm something to protectp it so I bought the Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster
I tried but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off dont do this
I sugestc making sure the product detail includes the second generation
Do not order this item if you wanti a DVD player with a 5 inch screens
You will receive a small orange colored player with a 3y
We had this printerv less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam
wex would get an error message and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it tol work for a short while
We finally ended upq sending back the printerc on their exchange program after I hadv tol ask to speak to a supervisor
The tech support wanted us to install at free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them wev have had the replacement printer less than two monthsf andc are already experiencing problems again
The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in ah very heavy amount and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam
Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape thatk pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth and for now the unit is working
We still havent addressed the excessivem ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem
I hope HP reviews comments on thisk website occasionally
I would like them tos know I have believed in their printers ande used them successfully for years but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position
Also HP tech support is very difficult to deal with at best
I talked tob several overseas techv support reps thatm spoke almostx unintelligible English
I am one consumer willing to pay a little moreg for a product that is wellk supported
Easy setup but who cares when the end result is a veryl slow video
Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movie The Mask
When hel whips his head fromb side tok side and you see the blur THATS what you see with this webcam Dont waste your moneyy
This sucker couldnt pick up a single channel not even one less than 10x miles away
theq case looks great and fits well but its nearly impossible too removel
I hadg to insert a credit card between the latches and pry form al long time
I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod
In addition its too wide ing the case to dock inz my logitechv speaker systemj
I might have consideredr keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for dockingp
Although the RS receiver doesnt have TV reception who cares
it is 12 the price PLL digital 3 speaker DXLOC switch and
Bought it for my wife the pink just didnt matchw anything in my wardrobe
She uses her player for the gym and treats it somewhat rough
This case doesnt protect the screen from scratches see most other reviews but it hasnt fallen off while shes worn it eithery
The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection
It is nice that it has a clip andh it fits then mp3 player snugly but
Would be nice if it has a clear window to protect the screen
According to SysInternals processb Explorer both HWI hardware interrupts and DPC deferred procedure calls tendc to run to 340 each while this card is installed both drop to under 1 onces its removed
Both remain under 1 while usingw another manufacturers usbbasedr 802f
Im given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers but Ive found no useful driver update info on DLinks web site last I looked
That other b adapter BTW gives better throughput than this bg card of DLinks
Does not consistently work I have a toshiba a15 Win XP Pro and sometimes this works but usually it doesnt
latelyg it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer
It used to have problems where ix would restartd the computer and it would say card not found which forced med to reload the driver
But lately its just beenl giving me a blue screen
ip have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issuesg
DLink needs to support their faulty product with a neww driver badd customer service
I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse
I doz not have the original packagingm otherwise I would have taken in back
The USB receiver is hard to get outo of its cradle in the back I often have tob pry it out with ak coinj or a credit card
If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time I can not seem to wake it up with any ofd the buttons
The ONLY thing thato works is using the wheel to scroll
The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver
I thought this wasy because I was using a Mac iu experienced the same behavior on my PC as well
Im goingv to throw this away since ia would not wish it on my enemy
It looked good but note being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was note very functional
Overall thisq item works as expected but requiresg to be reset i
theg ends are comming off this cable doesnt meeto the normal Belkin standards
We got the hdmi cables butn we areq not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website
The cables come without any packaging and there isb no indication anywhere that they are the same brand nameo items advertised on the website
We have notj yet used the cables yet and were not sure whether they will work or noth
Ever since I loadedc theo Targus drivers on my Tungsten C theq battery discharges quickly and wont take a full charge
The next step wasq to dox a hardy resett of the Tungsten C and Im hoping it will taken charge
It worked OK for 2 months but the KB kept on falling offa
When I complained iw was told thaty the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37
Yet it was advertised as compatible with the vso ppcd 2002
The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stoppedu working
I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC
worksk fine on Windows XP but does not work well with linuxb
Ive been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux
My built in 10100 NIC was much faster than this cardt would go
Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that of course works with no issues
Save yourself some headaches and stayj away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box
I just bought these to compare to my pair of v20sh andb they just suck in comparison
thed Bass isd nonm existent in comparisonu and thee highs and mids soundh absolutely tinny
Any sort of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion
These looks nice and are compact but the sound is not good at all
The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appallingl
I didu not notice in the productq description that this productg interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer
Since most new computers use usbr for serial interface the usefulness of this unit is limited
My two newly purchased HP computers do note have ank interface that is compatible with this product
The serial cable is hidden behind cardboard inb the clamshell package
So you dont see it prior to opening the package
Once the package is opened it is a messx that probably can not beg returned
Lastly this is one of the worst packaging jobs I have seen
The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the openingk knife or scissors
Remote isnt very responsivee and the display is WAAaay too bright will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person and the user interface is terriblep
The thing gets lousy reception and in general therer is a reason why this is always the lower priced iPod type radio on websites
They are trying to getv ridm of it because it s_cksr
I bought this alarm clock today April 7 2007 at Bed Bath and Beyond for 10
I bought it because of the product name small size andk variety ofn options
Unfortunately I realizedh it wasnt a great buy when iy brought it homer
and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in at certainv position so the clock would stay on
The connections appear to be very sensitive andm the batteryn doesnt stay in place
Its supposed to help you see the time in the dark but unless you have the clock ata ak certainm angleb everything will appear blurryy
actuallya the screen is blurry in most positions even with the light off
If youre a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment thisx is not the clockp for you
Youll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear
A final note on this product then clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems
ifj I close the cover all the way the clock shuts off
If youk want an alarmr clock that will last awhile I suggest buying something else
iq wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer
Even though instructions from thep manual was followed the printer did not work
The customer support is claimed to be 247 but no one hasy closed my help deskq ticket yet
So customers can naturally expect better customerq service anda better response time
I tried several times to contact sandiskm including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response
My wifesd cruzers justz failed as well the power light comes on it is recognizedv by XP and the light goes out the system cant ID the device so its useless
It does the same thing onf all of the XP systemsl in our house
Ive tried front side USB connectionsn rear connections and hub connections
andr I was going to order another 100 for the office
THANKS AMAZON BUT THE PHOTO DOESNT GIVE IT ANY CREDIT
THESE DONT COME WITH A plasticl CARRYING casem LIKE THE PHOTO
WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced ofz three remarkably similar devices all had thev same description and specs
A friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which hadx come loose
Since then it has come loosez twice more soz iy just dont use it anymore
When itm worked it worked fine but its is at best an inexpensive and temporary solutionf
I just purchased this item now Im planning to return it tomorrow
One of thea advertised features the ability to store liner notes just doesnt work properly
They just dont into the pocket without bending andor forcing them in
To me the liner notes have value and Im not willing to fold spindle or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
As soon as I receivedh thisu radio I tried it out by turning it onj and pulling the built in antenna up
The basef felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio
I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right
I can not comment on the reception as the antenna is broken
Overall its a nice looking unit butl they cheaped out on the materials
Machine started makingf loud grinding noises when started or while printing
Showed it to a repair shop says the fuser is a toast
Died justw after one yearp so have to bearx the expense
Beware i searched the web and looks like i am noti the only one with this problem
our MFC 8840DN worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that couldnt be fixed by the sales technician
Lots of waiting for a response from Brother at their call in websitee
Will never buy from Brother or Amazon again asv a result of this
The buttons dont havef that clickyb button feel so you press and youre like did it go
The labels are hard to read icons take a little figuring out
Honestly I use it forf turning onoff and if I want to do anything else I go upb to the iHome to adjust it
My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod videoj
theg 60gb model is thickerk than the 30gb and this case wont close around the 60gb iPod
A secondarye complaint is that though the case is sturdy and thed foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks there is no protection for then screen
Its justa ao hole in the case likec the hole for using the wheel and I justo require more protection for my video iPod
A third minor complaint is that theres a nonremovable knob on the back ofe the case for attachingl the belt clip and thex knob makesu it uncomfortable in a shirt orj pants pocket
Im returning mine for all of these reasons andc going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen too
I live in Washington DC so I generally get a signal when outdoors
Using these headphones did not yield an increasedc signalt for me
Now the good news they do get decentb receptionj I tried them in my office in NYC which has af northernq exposure and it got good reception
I too experienced the Blue Screen of Death on my laptop which has XP pro on it
I had to uninstall the card softwarek in order to stop myh system from continuously rebootingj
On another note the install of the router was GREAT regardless
I didnt get anywhere with the Tech support group and had to return everything
After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turnsb to pink anda yellow
Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again
Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image but it is slow and the cartridgeb runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos
This printer has been a piece ofh garbage sinceb the day I bought it
iw dont know why I kept trying as the purchase was made aboutx a year ago
It should have been thrown it in theo trash long ago and I would have cutk my losses instead I didh buy one more package of paper and ink
I have never gotten more than one picture in a rowf withoutr an error message turning the printer off turning it back on doinge that several times and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day
Now it says the cartridgei should be replaced whenw about 20 minutes earlier it toldc me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge ando I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures which would add upd to the claim ofs 100 per cartridge
The ironic thing is the handful of pictures that have printedp correctlyj have been beautiful
But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours
This is the last time I try to use the printer it isc finally going ink the trashj
com brought it home and printed a photographn that I hadn previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer myl motherinlaws
The resulting photograp was horrible it had a very greeno tintg to it
I then adjusteds the various enhancement controls within the printer thet green tint remained
I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual checkedcleaned the printg heads and still the problem remained
Given that the product is still on the market I suspect I had ab broken unit
I have onlyy had the batteries for a shortj time but they are working great
I have recharged all three sets 4 pers set three times each
thats what takso to run my Canon PowerShotS2I2 cameraall good news
I takel a lot of pictures andr I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours
But ii know that I need anotherp 3 sets to really keep me in the field for the day
I do alot ofm back packing and long walks on the beaches
These batteries are really good they have never let meq down as of yet thats why ik will be gettingm more
it says its an AV dock forl video ipods but it only would transmit audio top myf tv
whatb a waste AV cables that sell for 20 ares incredible
they sinply plugu into the headphone jack ofe myu 80 gigx ipod and into the av inputs of my tv
I was very disappointed when I received this to see that itj was simply a package off two cables
Cables that you can pick upg at Radio Shack forq MUCH cheaper
thei Airport expressn itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and go ton your localh Radio Shack for the miniRCA cable and a quickj search online for the optical to mini
iv dont like this mouse i brought andu never workq its useles
Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product Ive ever used
I was stupid and used it onp myf primary display first instead of using the 5050 isopropyl alcoholwater mix thats far superior toa klear screen products
My LCD now hasf cloudyy areas and streaks that simply will not come out
My 3 year oldz laptops display looksc nearlyh perfectg because I only used the 5050 solution on it my 2001fp looks horrible now
I am using two other PhilipsMagnavox remotes thatz are far more convenient and operate better
This one does notx look like the picture which looks more likeo the 425 model
It does not cover the equipment I have while the 425 model does Its learning mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least
Conclusion This wouldz make for a nice ornament itd does look nice and if you are lucky you may bei able to control some devices
I boughtr this product to replaces a previous HP allinone printer I had
This is by far the worst printer I have everc owned
It does not like photo paper itp is unreliable and it goes through ink quicklyf as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced
merchandise returned to vendor by shipper as damaged in shipmentt
