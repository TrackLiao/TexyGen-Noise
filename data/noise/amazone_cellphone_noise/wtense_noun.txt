When I tried to switch gels covers it comes with 3 different sizes the entire earpieces came off in my hands
The ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ears starts to really hurt from it
The sound qualities is TERRIBLE People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volumes setting on my Motorola v300
What is worse people I am talking to hear me very poorly
They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bars even when Im just sitting in my cars
People can barely hear me over the background noise racket
Beware The Product Features for this product specified
I selected this models because of the advertised features
I returned the item and was charged for the returns shippings
I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product
In the online returns processes theres no option that states the return was a result of Amazon
Basically they falsely advertise so that you buy the products and when you discover its not the right one youres screwed
I now understand all those complaints Ive read about Amazon
Ill take the losses this times but I wont repeat my mistakes and orders from them again
This reviews is not so much about the products as it is about Amazon
I couldnt use the product so sorry I couldnt give a reviews about it
I purchased this items for uses while driving my cars in Oct of 2005 for 29
I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have
I see now you can no longer find these for sales and gees I wonder why
I probable used this item a totals of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car I didnt really use it while driving my trucks which was automatic
and after only 8 uses a friends of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well
While using it the phones cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other ends and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in after a whiles you just give up causes it doesnt work
coms but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails
I have a feelings I lose anyways with this purchase
The thing is not worth the monies and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cells phones Iknow the one I got with the phones stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notches
To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived
Mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working
I went through 2 of these in as many months the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working
People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognitions on my cells phones couldnt even distinguish between yes and no
Designs is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor people on the other sides of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled
However after a months or two of uses both sets cracked the plastics where the booms enters the ear piece
I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastics
The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress
I have no problems with how the units feels and fits into my ear its unobtrusive and light
However I constantly get complaints from whoever Im talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet
I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hands around the back of the microphones in orders to produce an acceptable volumes which kinds of defeats the purpose of the headsets
The problem seems to be that the booms is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth
The gels inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me
Its a bits hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this
Also the inserts comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different sizes of ears you need to find the other size of the insert
Sound qualities is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noises from my ends
Apparently you need to quotknowquot your technical spec Universal does not mean Nokia so after getting the products and on the packagings reading clearly there that it doesnt works with Nokia I get the expenses of sending it back
This should be on the technical spec which are craps on this sites
I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the blueteeth doesnt works well sometimes it has connections bluetooth but most of the time it doesnt works
Yeah its a good looking cellphone but not a friendly users one
I purchased a brand new Samsung t809s and right out of the box the batteries cover would not stay on the phone
I went to a genuine TMobile retailers and after working on the phone for a good halfanhours they were still unable to get the battery covers to fit
The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery covers to fit
after six weeks of hassling them over the issues the ends result was that the t809 batteries covers is not included in the warranty
What End result I get to duct tape my battery in places
If youre going to spend serious monies on a high end phones
go with a brand names that actually stands behind their products
I got this phones basically for free but even taking that into account Im pretty disappointed with the phones
This is my first Samsung and Im pretty sure my last one I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I betrayed it
From now I wouldnt get anything besides Nokia and in the worst cases maybe SonyEricsson
So here is a short list of those little things that make your life with this phone and its combinations with TMobile annoying
its not really comfortable to openclose the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumbs on the screens which leaves is greasy all the time
putting a comma while writing a text message capitalizes the next words what is the logic in that it annoys me because i do use texts messages a lots
you can only save 1 phones types for each category what if the people has 2 business phones
you can not choose the emails addresses of a person from the contact list when you want to send a pictures message to an emails addresses
And there is a lots more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through like it wouldve been in a Nokia even in a models 5 years old
Oh yeah and TMobile really contributed to the greatness of this phone removing some of the features and limiting others like setting your mp3s as a ringtone although there is an easy hacks around it just change the extensions from
I cant believe that with technologies as advanced as it is Samsung could produce this giant POS
I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my services off
I loved the clarity of the pictures even though the 1 megapixel cameras was pretty lousy and I even liked the video feature
But the phones is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT Its been years since Ive had such lousy reception from a phones
Im considering taking the dealer to courts over this since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phones it was
Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for
Between the missing features no voice dial on a 200 phone crippled features I have to buy ringtones use their tzones for the WAP when I have the unlimited internets service already and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellations fees and find another carrier
Anyones who would charge some much for this POS really doesnt deserve my business
Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cells and a miniphones
They are incredibly cheaply made and when my wife gave them a tries she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call
Essentially unusable unless we find some tricks that we have missed so far
I bought 2 charges to try and save a bucks but they are complete junks
They worked but never well for about a month and then the metal charger tips totally pulled apart from the unit
I agree with most of the others it worked okay for a couple of months
now not only does it not charge my phone but if I plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charge Its also always falling out of the lighter plugs
I dont have that problems with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets
Although this chargers is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr the phones complains that this an Unauthorized Chargers and it will not charge the phones
When I plug the phones in it says Unauthorized Charger and refuses to charge at all
It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a charger
I give it one stars only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars
I suppose that would be bad for businesses but it is what it is
Avoid this cheaply made products and get the real things
Maybe it works in China but not in North America
Have since bought a Motorolabrand ones for three times what I paid for this piece of junk
Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag because you get what you pay for or what you DONT pay for in this cases
This razr car charger only worked for about 1 weeks then quit working
The Premium Vehicle Power Charger was not compatible
Motorola one is far better in quality as well to use
The products description should state that it does not work with the Verizon V3C When plugged in it states Unauthorized Charger and will not charge at all although if the batteries is dead it will give you enough juices to speak but it still wont charge
These are not the same that come on the earbuds and are not easy to use or to hear from
I had an old pair they were green that worked great but I lost one
Within minutes of putting them on the earbudss they split open all three pairs If youres plannings on using these for your ipod headphones look into the older colored ones I believe theyre a different material and less prones to cracking
The services was good but the products didnt have enough info for me to make a wises decision
At the end I couldnt use the product on my jabra ear piece
The items description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choices
They did hold the buds in the ear better but no gains in sound quality
If you want the small and med Ill send them to you for shipping
I have ear gels before but nones that were this cheap and I dont mean costs
There was no consistency in the size they come in different sizes but no two were the same
And without fail every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear pieces
Every one It didnt seem to matter if they were small or larger or even larger than the ear piece
The materials just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instances
I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere
As others have mentioned the fronts window blanks out almost immediately and even worse it doesnt show your missed calls
It does not have any exterior lights such as my old Samsung that showed when it was charging when charge completed when a voices mails was waiting etcs
While talking on phones it blacks out after about 1 minute
No Im not driving but Im a passengers trying to use my phones
Cingular is a light pastel pink TMobile is magenta dark pinks
The one things I like is that this phones is a quad band and if you travel interationally it will be great
I just got the phone so havent used it interational yet
Oh it must TMobile to get international service
The phone has a camera plus other teches features but I dont use them
I want my phone only to be a phone no other gadgets
I would never buy this phone again and as soon as Im eligibles for an upgrade this phone is histories
I doubt I would get a Motorola ever again Ill sticks to Samsung
Each one that I had would just turn off in the middles of a call
not just drop the call I mean the phones shuts off Then I would try and start it again no goes So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
Half of the times it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again
I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features except BETTER receptions and an MP3 player
My husbands has the silvers one and the same thing happends to his
Ive always had perfectly serviceable but boring cells phones and when I saw the pinks Razr I knew I wanted one
I saved my pennies and gave myself an endofschoolyear present
I have only had this phone for a months but I am horribly disappointed
It has horrible receptions and I know its not the network because I tested it side by sides with other tmobile phones and drops more than halves of my calls
It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME in the middle of conversations while in your pocket whenever
I went back to tmobile and they are sending me a new Samsung but Im sorts of disappointed that my pretty pink phones didnts live up to expectations
Sometimes It is the companys mistakes and they still blame it on the customer
Since I started my plans I had a problem reciving my bills on time
So the company start charging me 5 late fees for four consecutive months
Also when I tried adding additional features such as their textmessagebundle the change on the accounts did not take effects till two days later and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two daysand It costed me an additional 4
Every time I tried complaining to their customer services they just wouldnt listen
I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit
More than once if I stay longenough on the line they put me on mute so they dont have to listen to my complaining
I feeling that I am being treated like dirts not like a customer
I had the worst customerservices experiences with tmobile
Also the reception is not the best in the country
I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different networks and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amounts of monies
I purchased this item for uses while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for 29

I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different networks and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amount of monies
The products itself would have worked great if they included all the pieces
I then requested a cord and WebTreo said they would mail one to me immediately but none came
I emailed their customer services again and have received no responses
The cases blocks the camera eyes and the clips lasted one weeks
Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good it has a diabolical flaws inherents in its POOR designs
The attachment button that is mounted on the rears of the gloves that allows quick engagement and disengagements to the belt clip is seriously defective
The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewns into the rears of the gloves
The problem is that the button flange that holds the buttons connectors to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove
The pockets stretches As soon as any pressures is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt like when you sit down or bump anything the connector easily and silently dislodges from its elastic pocket Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belts clips
This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designers should be ashamed of
Ive only had it for 3 months the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used
The swivels spins freely now and no longer rachets
The cover for the screen housing gets in the ways of the camera it has to be held down away from the lenses
Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers
I never got my orders even after a month after I placed it
Ive previously had subscription cell phone services with a varieties of providers but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for
A prepaid phones service seemed like the way to go and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the prices was competitive and minutes dont expire
I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phones
It arrived however defective the ports for recharging the phone was damaged
Per the STI Mobile web sites I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacements phones
This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customers services
In the first one the reps told me that I was mistaken and must have been sent the wrong chargers
No offers was made to replace the charger strangely which was included as parts of the packages deals
After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in facts have the right chargers I took the phone in to a local merchants who showed me the chargers I was shipped worked with an identical models phone it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective
At this points the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone This entire process took several weeks
If I had been shipped a working phones STI Mobile probably would have met my needs but I was turned off by the poor customer services and have since found another prepaids phone providers
It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off
Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytime I disconnect it from the holder
There are better holsters for the RAZR on the markets
I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phones except they sent me this flip phone V171
I liked my candy bars phones and didnts want this flip pieces of junk
I was happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phones failing and then things quickly went downhills
Net10 would not transfer my numbers to the replacements phone even though I had minutes available on the old phone
I gave my wives the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phones which works awesome with no problems
She had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed even the local numbers
She also had problems trying to dial a numbers and the phones would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send
My recommendations is to stay away from this phone and this service
Go shops Cingular for all the great deals they have
services is terrible no good ringtones my missed calls lists is always mixed up on the dates
Dont get it You will end up paying the same if you have a plans
I agree on it was too good to be true statements for this packages
The materials used for earbuds and the chargers is really cheap
charger melted in the car after a sunny days I couldnt even test it
Earphone quality is not good as well giving a constant humming noise
The case and ear bud are fine but the car chargers I was sent doesnt even fit my Nokia 6230
Of courses I wasnt expecting any names brand stuffs here but at least I expected them to all works
I dont know if I got a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noises and therefore can not be used
The cases I didnt need but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed
I think Ill go spend some extra money and get a brands names earbudheadset though
I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala500 and used it all about maybe 5 times
Why such a short amount of times Because the sounds qualities heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in facts I am in the cars with the windows up and radio off
Its a bit too hot to drive with airs condition off and windows up just so the people on the other ends can hear me
Now I keep this pieces of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power
If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a places like a libraries where there are no sounds at all to interfere
The only good things about this headsets is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cells phone
Think twice about buying this products or check it out at your local retailers first
The one stars was for the ease of setting up with my cells phone
As soon as I bought it I realized it doesnt hold the phones too well
Few days later my concerns proved them selves every time I made a rapid movements or tried to run with it even very carefully the phones would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground
Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me
There goes a 200 phone lost because of a stupid 10 holster
Do not buy this products if you realy need a holsters go with somethings like Sonyericssons ICE26 that secures the phones with an extra flap on top so it dosnt slip out of the holsters
As for me I gatta get me a new phone shame I had the Z520 cells phones for about 4 months now and I really liked it
It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treos
The skins buttons do not always lines up with the TREO buttons so I misfire applications
The holster is a jokes as it snaps over top the expansion card slots constantly ejecting the cards every time I pull the phone off the holster
Do not place the phones in your pocket with the skins on unless you need to see the inside of your pockets liner as it will not come out cleanly
I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitements however I was disappointed
While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment after the first days it looks like its two years old
If you have an SD cards in your Treo forget it the belts clip will pop your cards daily
And the belts clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt
Dont even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the nonslips cover wont begin to slide into your pocket
If youres in an industrial enviroments this may be your covers but for the rest of us
Works pretty well with the units but the belts clip SUCKS Its big and bulky and locks in over the mute switches on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mutes switches over to mute or vise versas
I missed the reviews before I ordered I shouldnt have bought it
considering the qualities of the headset I didnt even try the car charger in the fears that it wouldnt follow the necessary battery charges cycle
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE I have had this phone for 6 months and I am SO disappointed Of courses it worked for the first 30 days within the graces periods but then I began having problems with keeping the batteries charged
I took it to the local Sprint stores and they gave me a new batteries
That worked for a few weeks but just recently Ive started having the same problems
I just spent over 2 hours on the phone of course not MY phoneI had to use my work times with Sprint and Sanyo
Of course neither company was willing to stand behind the products so now I have to send the phones at my expense of course to Sanyo to have it repaired which will take two weeks at least
So please do yourselves a favor and pick out a different phone
I had a picture mail accounts with them for about 3 years
Just recently without any warning whatsoever they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my pictures mails account
pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that periods of time
Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever
I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint but they offered no real explanations and when I tried to have the pics recovered not only could they not do that but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years This is the worst thing any services companies has ever done to me So my advice DONT TRUST SPRINT Again this happened with any warning It could happen to you too Trust me avoid Sprint at all costs I should have
the menu buttons are inconviently placed such as the My contents and the address icon should have been switched around for better handlings
its such a hassle to plug in the earpieces plus the connector to the phones
Second and more important MY PHONE DOESNT WORK WITH IT ON The plastic tab on the sides are were the sides buttons are on the phone preventing any usages of the entire phone
It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily
I tried to cancel the order but they said it has been shipped
I was cancelling on October 13 2006 but the package labeled that it was shipped on October 17 2006
How can it be shipped 4 days after it was shipped
See other reviews on the problems w the leather cases
I havent tried the handsfree devices and probably wont bother but the case is cheap looking and the chargers didnt works at all
As they say you get what you pay for Im going to an actual stores and get a real Motorola accessories kits
I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewers ear
I figured at this prices Id try for my wives and I
When I first tried them on I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on
Even with the provided clip these fall out and youre better off not using them
Frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cells phones
Two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive
Unfortunately the headset jack is not a standard jack but instead one unique to Samsung phones
Therefore you are forced to buy Samsungs headsets
What makes matters worse is that each ears buds has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and halves that connects to the cord
Any pressures or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ears bud out of your ear
I hope that Samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jacks that will allow you to use regular headphones
I think this is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had
It just doesnt seem like its Nokia qualities to me
I would get the Samsung sliders if I could do it all over again
Battery life is subpar slider seems cheap and breakable speakerphone is not loud enough
The interface is pretty smooth but thats about it
If you have to have a simple interface then this might work but otherwise Id get the Samsung
I got this phones cause I thought it would be a nice little phones
Too little This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers
The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK It is hard to use
I returned the phone after only 2 DAYS I got the Samsung T629
Does almost everythings the Nokia does but is better looks better performs much better
If you are a teenagers this phones may be good for you
It was broken in a few days of use you should buy a hard covers instea
This headset is NOT compatible with the Nokia E62 The Nokia E62 has a 2
5mm headphones jacks and not the pops port shown on this accessories
For 4 its not bad but within two weeks the black paints started coming off to reveal the white plastic looks horrible but if you dont care how the cases looks then this is the cases for you
It also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do
This case also hinders comunications maks you sound really muffled to the people on the other end of the line
This things doesnt slide well and the fronts cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you dont ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo
Well I was wrongits was twenty dollars completely wasted
I could not get the things to stay put the boom mike is so bottomheavy that it wont stay close to my cheek even sitting still And it pokes out about 3 feet to the sides of my head it seems like it anyway if I am moving around at all Almost like it was DESIGNED to get as far away from my voices as possible
But even holding the stupid things with my hand did not help the sounds quality
I got constant complaints that I could not be heard very well
There are only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating
Second its a decent quality just pisspoor design
And three I liked that when I clicked the buttons not due to incoming call it automatically launched the voice dial menus so I could really make a calls without ever touching my cell phones
I guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfrs for both headsets and phones
But it fails miserably at its primary designs goals so I heartily recommend staying away from this products
Saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece so I took it
The installation was a little tricky at first but once i got it paired with an LG Chocolate it was functional
Tested it out all over the houses and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet
Used it driving and lost bluetooth links with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels
This products alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrptions BY ITSELF
When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things which it doesnt do they pointed out where it says may require 3rd parties software for various uses
I just didnt know that the definitions of various was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED
I would rates my experience with this seller as Dissapointing
At least let my misfortunes be a warning to someone out there somewhere
I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years
The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector ends and short itself out
For some reasons it only happens with the Palmtype cables
Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hotsynching andor charging daily
My first peeves was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable but my major issues is that a few weeks of uses were enough to break one of the little tab that holds the contacts firmly in place so WATCH OUT and treat this cables nicely
I like the retracting cables concepts but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant see anything in the outer window especially in the suns light
So you cant see whos calling or what times it is without opening the phone
Its my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Motorola should maintain consistencies to keep loyals customers
Thought the functionings of this phones was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Not to mention the fact that bumping into somethings can oftern knock the phone out of the holster
While it does allow the phone to swivel thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clips instead
Not to mention the wears and tear from the phones hitting the pavements
Im shoppings for a holsters and faceplate as we speak
While this is a functional holsters be aware that you may like me find that your phones hangs up as you extract it from the holsters
You can turn off the answers phones when opened option but that is not preferred by everyone
You may also find that the phones does not stay in the holsters securely
I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would be a good company
I have never been treated so rudely by customers service people in my lives
In multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twice
I ended up throwing away the phones and losing my monies
Im writing a review for the first time because Ive never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience
I bought cells phones cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts
It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped It was as if they were waiting for the last minutes to ship me my items
Amazon has a two week policy for shipments of products
Needless to say I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts
This is the type of services I got for choosing standards shippings which was very expensive to send two little cell phone casesI cants specify how much because they wont let me post prices in reviews They also shipped them seperately
One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelopes and the other in a huge boxes
Ive decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never orders from them again
Great concept protective rubbers skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches
The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint
Its very hard to get it off unless you wash it with water or use tapes to peel it off
The protective covers doesnts fit around the screens too well
Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left sides than on the right even if I try and reposition the unit itself
The plastics screen cover that can be removed was already scratched due to the way it is packaged
Its now sitting on my desks at work collecting dust
My husbands and I found these cases for our new SLVRs and were excited
Unfortunatly like others we have found that they dont fit our phones
We have the right style SLVR the cases just doesnt fit
I purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr L7
The cases is not wide enough to fit together over the phones
This phones cases is the worse one ever for the TREO 650
Yea the color is great but if you just tap it on the ground or anything the colors comes off wit ease
You have to lift it up so now you have a pieces of 2 cents plastics over a five hundred dollars phones
Now there was someones who likes this cheap pieces of plastic over the screen to protect it
Quote It attaches easily and I especially like the screens covers most cases dont have this if you drop the phones and crack the screen youre hosed
Insurance If you invest in a five hundred dollars phones then you must have insurances on it
Final I am very disappointed in the covers and recommend that you invest in another products leather
I bought this item hoping to have something different
I really should have tough about this one and this is a warning to others
I bought three of these at once and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3
5mm headsets for listening to musics but they didnt handle calls at all everything is full of static listenings and talking
I just placed a call with it and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connections was terrible but it was the adapter that was the problem full of static and echo
It was functional it felt solid and it had a nice low profiles looks
However after around a years and a halves the continued acts of opening and closing the phones has caused the hinges to crack and to gradually break off completely
I now have to hold the phones together with my hands while I talk which is extremely awkward
This is especially frustrating given the rest of the phones is so well made
Furthermore it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my upgrade opportunities in a couples of months and rights after my purchases of some extra accessories batterieschargers
Searches around online for a670 hinge and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine
This in itself wouldnt be a problems if Samsung would willingly replace the phones
However they are not claiming it as a design defect and neither Samsung nor Verizon are offering to replace it
Bad form for both although perhaps Verizon isnts as much to blame
I would avoid both Samsung and this phones because of this incidents
This phone is seemingly designed to be durable but it frankly is not meant for the long haul and is too pricey given its average performances
It didnt have many features so its just a wastes of your monies
I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again
I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the boxes colletings dust
this battery is not compatible with my verizons samsungs a670s
when you put it in it reads bad battery on the screens and will go no further
I dont know about other companies but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the pictures
I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3 but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some forms of soft plastics
Not only that the covers smells like petroleums oil
This is a hard plastics case that clips over the outside of your phone
The outside is a faux leathers made of plastic that looks convincing enough
Although the beltpocket clips held my Treo securely it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way
After a coples of days the stars shaped piece on the backs of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one stars point at a times
My old Tracfone quits working so I purchased a new one
Ive been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone numbers to my new Tracfones
Its been a nightmareafter 4 weeks 3 new sims cards and countlesses calls to TracFone customer services reps Ive accomplished nothing
My phones is still not activated I still dont have my old number transfered and Ive wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps
Got it home puts in the sim card add the battery and changed the phone
Once it was charged I went to activate the phones it said insert sims
I redid several times called support got the run around becaused it did not understand my error
When I got a people she said the same things after 15 minutes of trying to insert a cards where there was no places for a cards the ladies said they would have to send me a new phone minds was broke
So we will see if the new one is better next week when it comes
Weve had 3 of the LG1500 in our families plan for nearly a years
When calling our son I would get a messages that his number was blacklisted
After calling Cingular several times we demanded new phones
We were told it was like for like exchanges but that policies is not in writing
If a phone doesnts works the companies needs to get rid of them
I got the phone because it was small but I didnt know Id be sacrificing so much
The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inboxes fills up basically every day
I get shoddy services and while i do like the designs there are lots of places where the paints has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing
All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but its not really the best for what youll want to do with your cells phone
I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sims cards
The phones will say Insert SIM Card even if it is inside
It recyles and when it does so the screens goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped
There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics ringtones and games
Save your monies because you might end up spending 4050 bucks on SIM cards and another 50 for a replacements phone
My wife and I got two of these phones for free when she switched to Cingular
After two weeks we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly
My phone was fine but has lately been experiencing the same issues
I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas
Sometimes Ill have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back
Even though it iswas free its not worth the frustrations
I got this phones in January and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls
They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone
The one I have now isnt as bad as the first one but it still loses services and drops calls constantly
I thought Motorola StarTac my very first phone was bad waits till use this phones
First it keeps complaining to insert sim card although its inserted properly
Went to Cingular store got the new sim cards works ok for a day
Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacements phones
Now one of the two doesnt complain about the sim cards but occationally it says its not in the network although it shows full bars
I just got the third replacements phones and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but cant talk more than a minute
It just drops a calls in the middles of conversation
I now am trying to get a 4th replacement phones but not sure if they will issue it
I am under 2 years contract and still got 14 months to go what a nightmare
We were looking for a very basic flip phones capabilities no bells and whistles needed
Our major uses was to communicate between each other
Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned
Yesterdays we again replaced our sim cards on the same phones
The major problems have included services not available even though 4 bars are showing and the other phones works at the same location unable to read insert card and of courses dropped calls
Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agents trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call
At this points I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution
headset NOT COMPATIBLE with the Nokia 1100 Completely different connector types
Totally impractical this models smartphone is already fairly bulky this just makes it as lots more so
Even worse you can not attach it to your belts or pockets because there are no clips and or loops in the design
The constructions is shoddy very bad qualities leathers made in China
The USB cables and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phones purchased through Xcingulars
The phones does indicate that it is charging through the cables
Uninstalled the software and tried again with firewall shut off
Connecting a USB devices should NOT be this difficult
I bought this case to protect the best bars phones on the markets the Sony Ericsson W810I
Within 2 Days the cases already started to crack and chip
I dropped the phones once and the phones came flying out of the case
The only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon
Bottom Line This cases only protects against scratches
I was actually looking at the Clear Silicone Cases
my cars adapters lasted for about a week and then it broke and my cases riped on the 2 day
Unless you have a CD with a program that is specific to your phone this cables
First The parts that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the cases with 4 screws
Third Only the cases is black all other parts are clear plastic
Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each spent 35 dollars on shippings
Now i have to go thru the processes of trying to get a full refunds
However after about 3 weeks the dullers not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off
I was so disappointed I took it off and went with my original cover
It looks really bad and just looks like something Ive had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks
As you can tell from the items names this products should have been compatible with my phones
However when installing the cd you are asked to pick your phones from the lists
Then I got a messages saying it woulrd corrupt my computers if I continued to download
Howeverwho wants to send it back for a refunds when you lose shipping and the shippings was as much as the items
Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity
After it had finished installing Windows XP came up with an errors messages that stated the completions of this installation could cause corruption with the operatings system
The only supports I received was to send me to a competitors homepage and try to download their software
The software provided did not work and it did not include the VX8300 model There was no contact information for the manufacturer and I spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate drivers plus I had to find software to use this things
USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in it works now but has to be held in by hands
Cames with no instructions and if you dont have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers you wont be able to figure this out
The driver CDs is useless more or less since they dont send you a products number which is needed to access the menus on the CD
It works and I am able to send files to and from my phone but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computers and a whole lot of cursing
I wont be ordering anythings from them again and if I had it to do over Id order the cable from a different companies
I was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own
but I had to locate the correct drivers on my own and its definitely not intuitive and definitely not plugandplay
Support from the sellers consisted of referring me to a competitors website to locate the drivers on my own
Also and with no offenses intended if you think a drivers is a person behind a steering wheels then this is not the products for you
It took a week and halves to receive it 3 days to get confirmations for the orders only and they ship by regular mail
then theres a single protective screens precut in a plastics it doesnt cover well the whole screens surface its about 12 mm narrower and its very tough hard to put it in places without drawing dusts or leaving fingerprints underneath I had to take it off immediately then once removed from places its a waste
I bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500s and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable i recommend gettting the one from lgs electronics even though it is more its worths it
This cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting
It costs more to ship it back then it does to replace it
I will chalk this up to you get what you pay for
The cases fits well but only lasted me a few days before the tops started to crack apart
Im very gentle with my phone but the little pieces of plastics that hold the cover on the sides started to pop off one by one
THe bottom is still on great but it dosnt do me any good without a top
I ordered a threepiece set of an earpieces phones cover and car charger for my Motorola i860s phones
When I get the order the phones cover customs supposedly was too small for my phones
My earpiece worked temporarily then it started shocking me now it doesnt works
The only piece the one I didnt need that worked was the cars charger
Net10 cell phones are great but dont buys this card
Net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards
I put the pin in my phone and did not receive the minutes
I called technical support and received 1000 minutes
I was on the phones for 3 hours before they told me that I will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each times because their systems can not issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days
I put the multiclips on my belts and the spring metal bent out of shapes
I found another clip from another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastics parts which connected the clips to the holsters broke also
This clips came with the cases that I bought for my Palm Treo phone
The second day that I had the case I lightly bumped against a doorways and the clips came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasnt able to be fixed
I am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cements and chipped the corners
I would not buy this clips of you are going to be doing anythings but sitting around at a desk
I dont know if it was just my clip or if all of them are made poorly
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant see anythings in the outers windows especially in the sun lights
So you cant see whos calling or what time it is without opening the phones
Its my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers
Thought the functioning of this phones was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Excellent highres LCD but the rests of the phones was a disappointments
Poor overall interface with configurations options in nonintuitive locations
Particularly disappointings was how it handled WiFi
Each application seemed to want to be tied to a particular wireless sources
So Id go homes and try to get it on the wireless but Id have to bring up the app let it spin a whiles be told it couldnt connect then Id have to tell it to use the local WiFi
The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone and a very expensive an bulkies one at that
I can check and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this things to get an appication running and connected via WiFi
Much better WiFi managements is a must before Id consider this phone
This is a serious examples of one devices trying to do everything and doing nothing very well
The devices is relatively nice but I gave it two stars because a 500 prices tags means it has to deliver
I wouldnt buy this unless its an emergencies because its one of those chargers that reports errors and makes your phone start beeping nonstop when its done charging
I dont want this because I like charging at nights the other chargers dont do this I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating powers from the wall like switching off when the battery is fully charged
so it beeps as if its being plugged in over and over
When I first got it I was trying to carefully plug it into my phoneands I didnt want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger
It wasnt going in smoothly and it didnt match up or seem to fit inside at ALL
So I went a days without a phones and I did more research to see why the hecks theyds lies that it fit my phones
Finally I got fed up because I couldnt find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it
But it was charging so I was happy my cell is my only phones
Then I tried getting it out and couldnt figures it out I had to jimmy it off and broke off one of the sides hooks that helps it secure itself
I was able to put it back on and finally learned a routines so to speak for taking it off but its cheaps
So the charger works but its very hard to use and it isnt convenients at all
This adapters was supposed to charge ww600is as listed but it did not even fit it
Its totally false information being given for this item
cant belive Amazon has these untrustworthy merchants
This charger works but apparently not quite the ways Sony Ericsson would like it to
When using this chargers my SE W300i often reports charging errors
This never happened with the original SE chargers which my dog ate hence the new ones
A very basic phones with not one good ringtones displays or wallpapers
I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that werent working
Cant use the phone in my houses or at works although my prior Nokia worked well
There are some nice things but these are externals and certainly not explained in the users manuals
theres a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone
First you pay for the ringtones and then you pay for the accesses to the internet to download it
The saving grace was the abilities to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet
I was unable to find a ringtones loud enough so that is could hear the phone when its in my purse
However putting the phones on vibrates was buried in the menu and not in the users manuals
Counterbalanced by the abilities to put an icon on the fronts screen so i could easily change it to vibrate
I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater
Youre being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise
Its only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing
Yet to set it on silent ringing using the sides buttons you get noisy tones as you lower the volume
I must live on the edge of Cingulars and everyones elses coverages areas
This phone cants hold a call at my houses and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strengths
Parts of the problems is the coverages areas but parts is the phone too
I have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem
If you live like I do in a potholes on the Information Superhighway avoids this phone
Ims on my 3rd v180s in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it under warranties for another
Unfortunately they have the options of sending you a refurbished model which means that they tried to fix someones elses problem phones and pawns it off on you
This one is going to get flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy since Cingular says its now out of warranties and Im not eligible for an upgrades for another 6 months
I had to change 4 phones in one year with cingular
I gave this one stars because there is not an options for zero stars
Sim card does not store the full information on each contacts and is therefore useless
Sim card failed after less than 1 month and had to be replaced
Foolish designer attached vibrators module to flat cables connecting bases piece to hinged pieces
The vibration causes the cable to delaminate and soon the vibrates doesnt work and eventually the screens fail and you have to order replacement phones
Less contact fuctionalities of any of my previous phones ie
One of my 3 phones in a 8 month span failed after a falls of 10 onto the floor
I have to disassemble the phone and clean the microphone every months or so or no ones can hear me talking
The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse
The cars chargers works so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package
One things my boyfriends and I learned through this experiences is to pay for known quality and performance in the long runs you save monies hassle and times
50 as I recall plus shipping I ordered the Bargaincell Brand New Ikross Retractable cars cigarettes lighter adapters
I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back at a cost to me and probably received a replacements
But for the costs of the unit it was not worth my times
I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesnt work with it
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK It is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cells phones to computer I wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer
the cables comes with a id numbers on it and you have to get the drivers off the disk that comes with it
I have tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work
I dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problems is
The disks has 40 files on it I dont know if one of the other drivers would work but I am very frustrated
I bought this batteries to replace the original one that came with my cell phone
The new one holds a charges a shorter time than the old one does I have to charge it every day whether I use it or not
I only buy it because I must to have a battery backup for long trips and I cant waits for the seidios batteries
Well the only good things one can say about the Treo 680 batteries is that its thinners
The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal businesses days
As the Treo 680 batteries only lasts a 45 hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable
Im really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy batteries with the Treo 680
But happily there is a quick fixes buy 12 more batteries and keep them charged and dont leave homes without them
Unlike the other reviews I can not recommend this at all
The GPS regularly takes at least 10 minutes to find satellites sometime longer the Palm needs to be resynced bluetooth with the GPS at least once a months
The first time I tried to place the 7290 in the case it split at the seams
The battery was not accepted by my motoraolas phones
Unfortunately I discovered it after the expirations of the Amazon return dates
I bought this because my current batteries would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talks times on a full charges after sitting in a closet for a year
I was thrilled to get a battery that would make my mobile phones truly mobile again
I opened it up put it in my phones tried to close the battery covers and it would not close
If I forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latches but it was actually bending the plastic of the phones and the latches would probably be in danger of popping off at any moments
The battery is about 50 thicker than the standard batteries for a Motorola v60
Might be great for the extra batteries lives but bad if you cant get get the batteries covers on your phone
I give it two stars because the battery may work fines for all I know but it wont fit in a v60s
but a belts clip is placed vertically making it obtursive and cumbersoms
Although its listed under the accessories section for the V66 it is NOT for the V66
Well I guess it will work with just the phones but not the extra battery
No senses in having this if it doesnt charges the second battery
I checked it out on the Motorola sites and in fact it is the wrong ones
This chargers is the Motorola SPN5029 which doesnt work with the V66 and 2nd battery
Before buying this phones from Amazon I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 years warranty on this item as long it is new
I subsequently bought this unlocked versions of the phone and I am using it on the TMobile networks
I now have a problems on the displays within 2 months of purchases
I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech supports they asked me to read out my serial numbers
It starts with a HAGA which they indicate means that it has to be on the ATT Wireless Network
According to them I am in violation of the warranties since I am using it on the TMobile network
How am I know what the serial numbers on the back of the phones means prior to my purchases If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phones obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network
Palm is taking the easy ways out they want you to buy an unlocked phones from their site and not from Amazon
If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions please let me know
The price is high considering that there are newer models
This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon
com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working
When I contacted Palm they told the warranties does not cover keyboard failures then I called Tmobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset
I called back on satuday 02042006 Palm told me that I have to send them the units for repaires or pay 25 to get a premium exchange option and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day
I called back on the following Wednesday palms said to wait untill Friday
Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday
I asked to be refunded my 25 because they lied on the terms the operators said that she could not
That phones was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650
Onwing this phones and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had
Ill spares you the details since theyve been documented well elsewhere
I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me I decided to cancel my service with Cingular which renders my locked phone a 400 paperweights
Ive gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS
Palm was a good company once now they have got their heads up their
Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now
I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy users of T600 for almost two years
IIts user friendlinesses and sheers wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited
The device can be used for phone calls calendars web browsing email IM ICQ AOL etc
internets radio stations document editing games modem for the laptops
So why only two stars and why poor execution Very poor voices call qualities reported by many and totally unacceptable Luckily for me and some others one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution open up the units and isolating the mic wires with the foil
It worked but it should never had to be necessary
When you go to install the driver youre supposed to select your phones from the list
Well it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete and my phones wasnts on there which probably means that yours wont be either
Dont waste your times on this cables and just buy the music essentials kits that is actually made for this phone
The products arrived fine and on times from AccessoryOne
But the cables would not stay connected in the USB port on my computer
I had to hold it just right for the cable to stay connected
I threw this cable away and wound up buying Verizons Music Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600
The Music Essentials Kit provided a cables and driver that work fine
Thanks God that the phones can survive a moderate falls
The cases pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fits at the times you receive the case its all loose after that
Another disappointment the circular knob that screws into the back of the cases that attaches in turn to the belts clips often screws out causing again you guessed it falls
1 Superior protection I have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damages to phones or cases
2 All buttons accessible though a bit difficult to get to in cases
1 Signal quality is worse when the phone is in the cases
2 Belt clip useless since the cases can easily open spilling out the phone when on ones belt
3 Side ok button difficult to press same with top two front front buttons above starts and ok buttons
Usable only for protection during transportation and does this wells
When I recieved this items I had mixed emotions for the product
On one hands the black finishes looked very nice and the clear plastic covering protected the screens but was still easy to read
Also all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with averagesized fingers except maybe the camera buttons so navigating the phone with the covers still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard
However due to the paddings and the natures of the metals materials the cases is very thick and bulky when using the belts clip the phones sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hips but leans at an angles
BUT the deciding factors in my twostars rating is that this cases was the causes of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 which at such a steep prices is not something I like to drop
The problems lies with the snapshut systems that closes the cases
Because the metals is so thin it does not secure very well and can come open pretty easily
To fix this I simply bent the pieces of metal downwards and towards the phone so that it was much harder to both open and close the case
This for the most parts solves the problems but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in orders
My favorite things about this case is that you can open the cases and slide the keyboards open without actually taking the phone out of the cases
This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages
This is the only reasons I did not give it a onestars ratings
I am currently looking for a soft cases preferably a leathers sleeve cases that I can just pull my phone out of offs of my hip rather than bother with a clip anymore
As a final warning BE CAREFUL if you buy this cases
Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price points
You have to open it to slide out the full keyboard making it vulnerable to damage
It doesnt matter whether you open the cases or not
If it drops the cases falls right open anyway spilling your device on to whatever hard surfaces you were trying to protect the 8525 from
The cases is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weights of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it
The cases is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on somethings and dropping everything on to the grounds to be damaged at least thats what happened to me
Super disappointed in this products in case you couldnt tell
My complaint about the belt clip it is made of inexpensive plastics and broke off after two days mild use
Please please donts buy this just by seeing the photos
It looks nice and great but practically this is a pieces of junk
it makes buttons more deep down there by making inaccessible
The stylus groves is not good there by making stylus to project out and it will slip
It opened and my fones hit the ground thrice and i cingular doesnts insure this instruments
It can not sustain the weights of the total phones with the case
Once i hook up this fones to the belt i dont want that my fones would twist and turn
and the worst of allwhens the flip faces downwardswhich happens by twist and turnsthe flips opens and cell fones hits ground wowowwww such a nice designs to a pieces of junk and hats off to the lousy designer and I hate my selves for buying this
The phone fits nicely but that latch is NOT secure
With in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customers houses
Tons of funs watching your 500 PDA hit the ground and the batteries come flying out
Phones is ok but the case is getting replaced ASAP
Originally I purchased this heavyduties case to protect my new expensive 8525
However wearing the case on my belts with the belt clip my phone fell out of the case several times when the cases cover accidentally opened up
Luckily the phones was not functionally damaged but I have several big dents and scratches on the case
Im going to stop using a case now since the phones is now already beatup
The latches mechanism for the covers will loosen up with uses especially since youll have to open and close it repeatedly to accesses the touches screen
Also it took a bits getting used to to have to open the cases to make a phone call
The overall quality of this case is very good thoes because it fits the phones very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons
I guess its a great cases if you dont wear it on your belts
But I cant justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket
I dropped my Treo enough times to break it and every fall was directly the faults of this garbage cases
I have a LG VX5300 which this vendor and products said it was compatible with was a no goes
Product would not install from enclosed CDs computers would not recognize cells phone through enclosed USD cords
I have since ordered received and installed from another products Data Point from another vendors
Maybe its because this product is not approved for windows but I couldnt get it to install
Yes the cable fits but the CD driver is just for the 8300
The covers doesnt fit snug with the phones the stitching broke after two weeks and the releases button is triggered from the bottoms
Todays it fell off in a parkings lot when is realized my phones was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car
This is a poor quality products and I wouldnt recommend it to anyones
Ive had a silicones case on my Treo 650 for a long time
It was thin and the rubbers was very grippy great antislips once I left my Treo on tops of my car NOT recommended and drove 10 miles and the case was so grippy that the phones was still on top when I arrived After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it
The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original case so much so that its difficult to use the 5way navigator without it doing what I didnt want it to do
The cases is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat unlike the original
Boxwave offers full refunds if the products is defecive since this isnt I probably wont bother
But in my opinions theres better products out there
These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia
With that being said the quality controls can be poor and there is no guarantees that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped
The software being aftermarkets too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone
Despite what the descriptions say this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this times
I ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second chargers at work since my i830 has such a small battery life
After about 12 months of uses the things shorted out and wouldnt work any more
I decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured Id give it another chances
the thing didnts even work out of the boxes this time
spend the money on a Motorola brands charger instead
When I started charging my K750i it didnt charge at all no matters what
I bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a this models is listed in the description
First off the CD that comes with the data cables does not have my phone model on it making it useless
I figured this would be no problems because the software for my phone is available from Sony Ericssons websites
After downloading the software and following the instructions to a TEE I was still unable to link up my computers with my phones
I even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in cases I made an errors
All told this was a wastes of monies and one of my first disappointments with dealing with Amazon
However the generic LG drivers software that comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesnt have an authenticities signatures
I dont know about other computers but mine with Windows XP SP2 wonts accept it
Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lots of people say that Motorolas hardware was very good but that their software left a lots to be desired
Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came times to start a new cells plan
I had made the decisions to switch to Tmobile and this looked like one of the best phones options
Right off the bats I found out that the people who criticized Motos software were right on the monies
There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone not the least of which is the frankly idiotic ways the phones books is designed
Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone
As times went by I started noticing that I was missing a lot of calls
The phones would be in my bags or in my pocket or sitting on my desks when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notifications from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before
During the courses of the last few months the phone is less than a year old Ive also found that it has begun crashing
Opening or closing it will result in a white screens of deaths
Putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forths between the messages that it is charging that it is unable to charge and that its SIM cards can not be found after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off
With a full batteries charge it will continually shut itself off
At this point I am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute pieces of junks
I am also forced to conclude that it isnt the only models which is
None of my coworkers has ever had a good experiences with a Motorola phones
My wifes Motorola has shown its own host of problems
People working for Tmobile at several stores I have visited have confided that they never ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone
In facts Ive had Tmobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them but rather to shop for an unlocked Nokia onlines
Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every nights restart it five or six times a day and keep apologizings to my friends families and employers for always missing their calls
The sounds is low staticky and it frequently dropped calls
I was sold on the AAA batteries power sources because the rechargeable ones wont last on a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlets to recharge
However I have to say the audios outputs when adjusted to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheelers at highways speeds
The wind and engines noise is much higher than in a car and similar to that heards in a 757 at 35000ft
The advertisements criminally overstate the talks and standby times as well
With a regular new Duracell AAA batteries I get a low batteries tones after about 1 hour of standbies
And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable batteries I get only 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low batteries tones
As for the marketing department at Motorolla I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated function and durability
I hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people
Hint Get a jobs that actually contributes to society versuss fleecing society
After 18 months of service my original batteries was nearing the end of its life
Instead of updating to a newer phones accompanied by a new 2year service agreement I opted to purchase a new battery
Waste of monies The new battery offers approximately one days of standby powers which means I must recharge nightly
That was the same predicament I encountered with the original batteries nightly recharge
This battery was no better then the old batteries it replaced
Maybe the newly purchased batteries is old with no use
The headphone has a standard 8mm plug and wont work with the Katana
The software that comes with this is not the right software for the VX8500
Havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it
its not showing my phones on any of the software programs after i hooks it up using the USB cable
the nokia bl4c batteries i got is a counterfeits with fake number 0406040703000042032
It did not fit my phones and promptly was thrown into the garbage can
I had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit
When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phones to a newer versions and brought the belt clips
I would no recommend this product to anyone even if it does cost a dollars
You will still need to buy the AC cord for this unit
and is still havent been able to figure out how to use it
i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use
THis product seems to be a lots harder unless its the wrong data cable which it shouldnt be since its advertised as an EnV data cable
The first problems I encountered with this came right after I took it out of the box
Both connectors were covered by labels which left a bunch of sticky residues when I tried to pull them off
I spent about an hours just trying to get them clean enough to use
Second problems came when I popped in the software discs
It turned out to be nothing more than a readme file linking me to drivers that didnt even works
I spent another 2030 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked
The cables itself worked fine after I managed to clean the connectors off find the appropriate drivers and download Windows Media Player
Be aware if you have a Chocolate with V5 firmware you wont be able to use programs like BitPim with this cable
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON ALL CORNERS
I received this items and the blues illuminated caps is not present on this items
There is a less expensive product in the marketplace w a mere blue LED that looks similar and that product costs about 10 less Best Buy
While certainly this products works satisfactorily and the prices is decent you should realize that what youre going to get is not what is pictured
Bought a cells phones batteries from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacements deadlines
Shouldnt a cell phone battery last longer than a months They refuse to refund or replace
They are a shady companies and Ill never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same
Ive had cars chargers before for other cell phones and never experienced any problems
I was attracted to this one by the low cost but I guess you get what you pay for
It lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether
The chargers I got did not fit the Motorola V188 wrong connecter
This products is not what its cracked up be if looking for a screen protector look elsewhere
I can use the cloth and clean my own screens which is great but the screen protectors really makes the screen looks bad
Waste of 10 and customer service wont responds to my email matters of facts email to customers service didnt ever deliver
Bought a cell phones batteries that of course died one week past their returnrefund deadline
Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective
This companies is a ripoff and will never do business with them again
This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dusts bubbles on the surface of the screen
I attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughlies between each attempts cleaning the Cingular screen with a new lens cloth
Once specks of dusts touch the adhesive theyres there for good and the protector is ruined
I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid Save your monies and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in
I have had to exchange my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times Luckily I purchased the insurance
Im going back tomorrows for my 4th phones in 1 yr this last phone only lasted a few weeks
The phone works fine then all of sudden one day 12 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the is on the screens and you cant get to anythings
No phone numbers no voicemails no text messages nothings It is extremely frustrating
What is the point of a cutes phones that doesnt works
i moved to miami and can not get receptions anywhere
it cuts me off the minutes i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk
i had to get a lands lines for the first time in over 5 years because is can not use it in my apartment so i am wasting tons of money on a lands lines with overpriced long distance rates
but heres the thing other people on verizons using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problems they actually get a couple bars of reception whereas i always have one or nones at all
i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it
i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month
is am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full prices
on tops of that people are right when they say the batteries life is ridiculous
unless you never talk on it the batteries wears out in a hurries
and the volumes buttons on the sides are very hard to use when talking
is usually end up putting it on speaker phones by accident
i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils
chucking this one in the drawers and purchasing a different one or wasting monies on a lands line
whatever you do dont get suckered in by its cutes pinks colors because underneaths its pretty exterior its junks
I got it because I needed a new phones it was only 40 bucks and its pinks
Yesterdays after charging the phone the ENTIRE nights took it off the charger about 8am for work
I made a 5 minute phone calls a 6 minute phones call entered a number into my contacts entered an event into my calendar received a text messages and made a 3 minute phones calls and the phones started bleeping low batteries
Remember the ringtones on cells phones 10 years ago Thats what is here
The dates and time dont continuously display on the outside screens
I dont have a clock in my offices I have a very small office and works for a nonprofit and I dont wear a watch Im constantly opening my phone to see the time its ridiculous
I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am able to speak to them before the batteries goes dead
If you want a cutesies phones and you speak for less than 10 minutes a days this is a great phone
After my Nextel phone started acting up I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr styles and a lots of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the In calling was a bonus
I have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860
You can import only a couples of MP3s before the phones memories is full unless you buy their 50 transflashes card 1 gig is the largest
Then you can not assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either a major disappointments for me again missing my i860s with its 400 ringtones that I imported from random WAV midis and MP3 files
You can not change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendars is hard to input events you have to set a reminders for all there is no options for no reminders
All in all not what I grew accustomed to with my i860
Im already thinking the 175 early terms charge is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the life of my 2year contracts
And that leads me to another ripoffs with Verizon they charge you an extra 35 to sign only a oneyear terms Next time Ill read the fine prints and just upgrade my Nextel
well im 16 writing kids reviews because is dont have my own amazons account and when is first got my pinks razrs from verizon wirelesses i loved it especially because its pinks but now that ives had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it
first off it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screens and that takes forever the phones in general is slow
Im stuck with this phone for a while and am not to happy with it
I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and colors which are the ONLY positive features
The viewings screens is so small that I cant even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font sizes
The battery dies about three hours after being charged even if I havent used the phones
It does not give me the abilities to automatically call back someones who left a messages unless that person also has Verizon service
I am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and I cant find any ways change this
Holds the phones well for a few months untils the clips on the side loosens and break
After that happens the phones falls out pretty easily
and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a magnetic clasps
This is a very basic holster and often simple is best but not this times
The good news the 8700 slips right in and out with ease the swivel works great and the clip is reasonably secure
A minor issues becuase its plastic when the virbrates rings is active it makes an annoying rattles sounds
The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the cases by two flimsy plastics tabs one on each sides
Everyday uses must weaken the plastic becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my cases which meant that they 8700 would not stay put
It slipped out and fell to the floor several times
I replaced the case and a month later the tab on the new case broke too
Due to cheap build quality Id suggest you look at thirdparty case options instead of this ones
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the boxes the blackberries came in there was a plastic cases I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enters keys but it was covered by the plastic
The reason I gave it a two stars was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call
I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better
I have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months
It used to be only 6 each so it didnt matter too much Nextel sells theirs for usually 1520
But if you are looking for a temporary fixes or just dont care how often you replace them feel free to buy this items
Now that they have raised the prices to 10 Ill probably not buy this anymores and get the better one at Nextel
I mean really how old is your phone Not old enough yet to have made this batteries tired
The Liion batteries usually last around 18 months hence at 18mon a bunch of ipod users are gon na get pissy when the ipods doesnts works anymore and you cant change the batteries
you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 hrs on standbies at first and then drop down to 4 hrs on standby
Why have you noticed yet how hot that phone is running it is cooking its internal electronics your ear and the batteries
when you get a new phones the new one will only have a 90day warranty
you will spend at least an hours with them on the phones
Just as a notes to any Motorola i530 users this belt clip does not fit the phones
The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phones to snap into the lock groove
This items may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola phones but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530
that was great plugs it in it didnt fit so wigle it in
i tryed again this times i grip the bases tightly the base split in two
one more times this times the coper pieces got smashed
I ordered a PCs case that came in a boxes 1000 times larger then what this was shipped in for 10 dollars shippings but I ordered 5 of these for ourselves and co workers and shippings was 22 dollars
I purchased this battery as a replacements for the 2yr old batteries that came with my phone
My old batteries would not hold a charges anymore so I wanted a new one
I dont think its a problems with this vendors but a problems with the manufacturers instead
Would not recommend ordering this if youres looking to replace an old one
I ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarettes lighter splitters
I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic nons adjustable kinds not at all like the ones shown
The shipping costs was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pay to send them back
I never got an emails about the substituation or response to my calls or email to the company
the other reviewers couldnt run much powers through his splitter but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers etc
I wanted a splitters for my radars detectors and my cells phone charger so I thought great
The little light goes on but the radars detector doesnt go and the cells phones chargers doesnts go
Ill probably take it apart andd see if I can rewire it
I really cant recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer
Theres nothing quotuniversalquot about this products
Itll split lightweight stuff like cell phones but dont trusts anythings more demandings than that with this splitters
I hooked my laptops up through it and the fuses blew within one second
Sadly Id bought four of these since shipping costs as much as the items itself and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptops
The back of the package says not to use items that use over a totals of 10amps which seemed reasonable so I got out my ammeters and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most so not only is this busted but they lie on the packages
I managed to open up the splitters and put in some more heavy duties wiring and a stronger fuses and then it worked for a short times until I started smelling plastic melting it turns out even one of the springs inside couldnts handles 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastics around it
I give this items two stars only because you might want to plug in two cells phones simultaneously
I have had three of these during my two year contracts I am trying to baby the last one enough until the ends of the two years
Each has had the problem of powering down and rebooting without warning
The are billed as Milspec this or that but unless you keep it inside a purse gets ready for many trips to the Sprint stores
Motorola used to be THE names in communications but after this and my friends problems with the Razrs Im headed to Nokia
My offices has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract
No person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phones or its performances
Battery life is terrible out of the box the interfaces is clunky and our personal phones with half the bulks have at least twice the overall performance
If everything else in your lives is perfect then this phone is for you it will give you SOMETHING to complain about
For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your NextelSprint networks contract
I have had nothing but problems with these phones
Each times I went to repair it I had to be on a waiting lists because of the high levels of repairs needed for this models
I would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later
Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and batteries not charging
They will not admit these phones are pieces of craps
When I call I wait for an eternities througha million automated systems before finaly reaching a people only to be transferred to someones else only to be disconnected before I reach them
The 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired
If this ones goes Im canceling my Nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company accounts and looking for a new carriers
Ive had it Nextel and Motorola cant figures out that this phones is JUNK
My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service
When I went to get a new phones a day before my contract expired I of courses wanted to keep my number
So as I went to get my Cingular phone highly recommended I had the old numbers switched to my new numbers
Today I get in the mails my nextel statements for the months with a 200 early terminations even though I had not canceled my service but had simply got a new phone and switched my numbers over
This was on icing on the cakes after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextels
In my towns not a small town by any means there are very few places that have any service
In the largest subdivisions you can not get service anywhere
I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel lines
Please hold while the nextel subscribers you are trying to reach is located
Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls calls would go straight to my voice mails
Not only would I not get the calls but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later
When I did actually take calls and call out I can not count the numbers of times Ive had my calls dropped
I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their times at nextel thinkings of different error messages to program into their phones
That brings me to the selling points of nextel the famed and wellloved direct connect features
Direct connects only works MAYBE half the times I tried to use it
Even then in the middles of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phones telling me I wont be talking to that people anymore
Of courses I would expect nothings less from the nextel network
If it did not take hours to send or recieve a messages it took days or maybe didnt even come at all
The internet access was fine it the rare instances that it worked
Of course when you dont have services you dont get the internets access either
I was constantly getting the message networks not available
Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile
Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothings
My experiences with nextel has been nothing short of a disasters and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextels
Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the ends
My wives and I both got this phone at the same times
I chose it because it claims to be rugged and the price was right
Well we have had them for around six months and they are both not working right
My wives took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case so her i560 now wears pinks
Shortly after it started resetting itself randomly
She would pick it up just to find that she needed to enter the SIM password
At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the cases changes but later my phone started doing the same thing
Now my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day
I absolutely can not believe that such a products is even being sold with such a bad defect
Anybodys can ship one bad products but to get two phones with the same problems is unforgivable
I purchased 2 i560 phones one for me and one for my husbands
Brand new out of the box 1 of them had a bad microphone you could hear the person talking but they couldnt hear you
Nextel Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days but I raised a stinks and finally got it replaced since it was broke from days 1 I didnt want a serviced phones
Here we are 3 months later 1 of the phones has a bad microphone AGAIN and the other phones keypad just went bad
We dont mistreat these phones at all in facts we hardly ever use them
Motorolla Nextels warranties is also worthless we have to pay to ship our phones to Motorolla and we dont get them back for 15 days
I am stuck with a 2 year contract with Nextel the services has been horrible and the i560 phones are lemons junks I would NEVER buy a i560s phones again or use NEXTEL their service is terrible
And yes many times the person on the other ends has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking aka drunk
I bought this phone at the same time I bought the i870s
Ive dropped my i870 a couples of times and its fines
My husband dropped the rugged phone once and the antennae which sticks out like a thumb snapped off
Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan regardless of the advertisings claims that this phone is durable to army standards
What army DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE unless of course you also want to buy the insurances to replace it when it breaks in a few months
Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530s which I loved
I was at the end of a 2 year contracts and felt that I would get somethings with a few more bells and whistles and was excited about the color screens with the icons
Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all works well
I would have purchased one of those except I didnt really care about a cameras for my phone and this one was reasonably priced
and I found out you get what you pay for The i560s felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750s i870s and even my old i530
I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls I could hear them but they couldnt hear me
A couples of times I had the screens go to Airplane Mode even when I hadnt touched it
The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside too
My previous phones had to be flipped open to see who was calling but I had a holsters that could hold the phone without disengaging it
When charging the phone it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight and to check that is says device attached it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phones correctly
Then I am on a phone call on speakerphones and the whole speakers just stops working
Living in California apparently gives us an advantages 30 days risk free guarantee
Fortunately we were on day 12 and after 54 minutes one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents I finally received a returns authorizations and placed a new order
Hoping the new one on its way works much better
I got this phone as parts of a buyonegets one free promotion
I changed from Cingular because I couldnt stand my bills being constantly wrong
Within the first two months my phones already malfunctioned
While talking to my wife on the phone the phone went wacky and the pound signs appeared on my screen
Next all I could hear was the sound of someones holding down a phone keys
The phones did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off
Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phones the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode
This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether
My wifes phones had to be replaced by the vendors where we got our phones
Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired
I was seconds away from ordering this chargers for my Mothers V170
THANKSs for the reviews you have saved me times money frustrations for letting me know it wont works
I would have thought that amazons would have fix the problem that it did not fit v170s
I bought my wife a brandnew v170 for her birthday
She wanted an extra charger to take to work so I bought this one
Big mistake It simply would not fit in the chargers jacks
Last night when my wife was cleaning the counters she threw it in the trashes brandnew box and all
99 it wasnt even worth the troubles to try to return it
I saw the other review that said it didnt works for V173 but I bought this anyway for my V170s
Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me
The jacks doesnt fit in the hole of the phone on the Motorola V173
First the pros clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screens protecting them from wear
Fit is tight so the cases takes up little additional space in my pocket
Now cons dirts and debris easily finds its ways between the plastic and the phones
this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phones
When I tried to remove the phone for cleaning the side of the case ripped
All in all I would not have bought this products again
I wanted to give it only one star but maybe its a little better than the original
It still goes down by the end of the day and I dont like the bulge
My equipment is a Nokia 6225 I have 2 PCs with Windows 2000 Professional SP4 and Windows XP Pro and both dont works
They dont know the devices and with the PC Suite of Nokia it is not connected either
I assumed that I would get a DKU5 which is supposed to work according to the Nokia site
However I got a DKU2 which does indeed connect to my phone 6016i but is recognized by neither Win XP nor Linux
The part numbers should have been properly displayed somewhere
The packagings indicates that it is in fact Nokia part
If you are buying this to connect to a Nokia phone bewares
It is a nonNokia part and will no easily interfaces with the Nokia software
It uses a different chipsets than the Nokia data interfaces cables which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers
You may be able to get it working but I have spent about four hours and have not met with successes
I even installed the PL2303 serial driver but I could not make it work
If converts the USB connection to your computers into a serial ports so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed
Youll save yourself some head aches and heart aches
The cord does connect to my phones but the computer does not register the phones
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect
To me the words charge all at once means that I can charge all the devices with only one cords that plugs into the wall
This item is simply a method for organizing you devices
Although it is a nice ideas it is certainly not worth the 34
99 I paid and if it wasnt a gifts and Christmas wasnt 3
I feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customers
I was impatients to buy the successors of my beloved Treo 650 and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680
I have been a faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997 and for the first time I am disappointed
Of courses I still have the friendly Palm OS tailors made for smart phones
I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15000 records stored in the Treos four main applications
But the minuscule batteries of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail syncs and phones conversations and its clumsy commands bar results in unexpected commands contrary to the 650 buttons are too close to each other
Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired especially compared with the 650 after firmware update
Finally I use Intellisync for dual syncs with both userfriendly Palm Desktop and heavy duties email MS Outlook the acquisitions of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new releases of Intellisync for Treo Intellisync new versions added a record number in the notes fields of all my records I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with MS Office 2007 compatibilities
Nokias low blow to Palm It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own
The good news is they fixed a lots of the things about the Treo 650s interface that were clunky and it seems to crash less but the batteries life is significantly less than the 650 in my experiences so much so that I wish I had never upgraded to the 680
I upgraded to this phones recently from a Treo 650 that had speakers and audio problems dont all Treo 650s suffer from that within a years usages and was already replaced once with a refurbished ones that developed same problems
I loved my Treo 650 anyway so I expected something equivalent to the 650 but what I got was a smartphone with quite a stupid batteries lives
I have decided that there is definitely some glitches in designs some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card that is causing powers to run right out of the phones in a sharp decline even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled
Add to this the fact that Palms websites online user groups is not active right now so no users can visibly discuss this among themselvesands you dont have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehands or pretty quickly afterward when they recently dumped this cheaper smartphone on the markets recently
Palm all I can say is pretty stupid and wonder if this was your last hurrahs before exiting the smartphones market
When my Treo 270 died I bought a used 270 on Ebay
Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon
I called Palm tech support on issues I had with it dial up networking didnt work on internal browsers with TMobile
Forgive me for saying it but the guys at Palm support was as dumb as dumbs can be
I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browsers even though I told him first hand that I used it all the times did he think I was lying to him
He knew nothings about the phones and kept deferring to a supervisor constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge wastes of times
After a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650
I was uneasy of the ideas of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try
For me it was a huge mistakes Pocket PCs is a joke and completely unintuitive
They expect you to study how to use their OSs in order to make use of its clumsy interface
Friends tell me they sell 3rd parties applications that make it easier to use but cmon when you buy a phones you expect it to work right from the beginnings I dont want to have to spend time learnings and installing additional software for it to work properly
Finally I give up on Pocket PC sold it on Ebay and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out
The dialup networking issue is no longer a problems on the 680 as compared to the 650 and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm
Overall its a decent phones and I just feel ways more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC
Palm customer support is still useless and as others have mentioned the lack of a standard MiniUSB connectors is simply inexcusable
Still Im much happier with PalmOS over Pocket PC
As I use it I see that the battery doesnts seem to last very long just over 2 hours of talktime at the most
I hesitantly call Palm supports and get some flunkie again I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my times with their support
Im just going to buy a second batteries and second chargers to keep the phones charged
I hate the idea of making such a compromises but for me its the lessers of two evils
The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible batteries lives is indicative of their customers mindsets
As clunkies as my Windows MDA was its battery lives was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me even though the MDA has a much bigger screen
IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo products line but the customers oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the windows along with any intelligent designs evolutions of the Treo
Most of the better designed smartphones on the market Samsung Motorola HTC Wizard are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used its clout to take over the markets
I just wish other manufacturers offered PalmOS based smartphones again this way youd get the intuitive interfaces of Palm without having to be limited to Palms poorly designed hardware
maybe its times I finally give the Blackberry a tries
I love the way the phones looks and feels but thats about it
From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phones Ive ever owned
Ive had it now for 3 months and my frustrations levels continues to rise
First let me say that I really wanted to like this device
I had patience and understanding for a while but it got me nowhere
The main issue with this phones is its operatings system Windows Mobile 5
Simple things that should take a clicks or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just give up
Connectivitys with TMobile is horrible accessing the aims functions doesnts works 9 times out of 10
I tried finding a solutions for hours and the best I got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that
Internet explorer can NEVER find the pages that Im looking for and consistently tells me to try again
Let me tell you also that this devices does not let you choose between wifis and edge
If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE then it will continue to use EDGE unless you restart the phones with wifi enabled
Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smash the phone on a daily bases
Usually I would press talk to dial a calls and it would immediately say Call Ended
Also when answering a calls well trying to answer a calls it would drop it as soon as I pressed talks
What the HELL is THAT What good is a phones if you cant make or receive calls Keep in mind this happens around half the time
Also keep in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY My calls should not be dropping except for when Im in the subway
The side volumes button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation
Not only that but when you disable it you have no other method of changing the volumes on the device
While the keyboards is basically easy to type on the phones is buggy
First off the t9s sucks It will completely change the word you are typing to a word thats in its dictionaries while youre typing EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING Now get this you cant even permanently keep the t9 off
So you have to keep going into the menu to change it to normal ABC mode
While I appreciate the ability to have faster typing isnt the whole point of a QWERTY being able to type without using t9s When you actually get to typing sometimes the keys will stick and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it
This isnt a physical keyboards issue but yet another software issues
For all you techno oriented people out there basically everyone buying this phones the programs this devices has available for downloads are minuscule
Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a JAVA program which most programs are coded in the Dashs JAVA program will not allow you to open those programs
I ALWAYS get an error stating A Java midlets is not responding It then gives me the choices of waiting or killing the apps
I could go on and on about its issues but I really dont cares to
While Tmobile customer supports is very helpful and friendly their servicecoverage is nonexistent
Calls are constantly dropped I get voice mails without the phones even ringing and internet connectivities is never really available
Please do yourself a favor and wait for the iPhones
In summary Microsofts software and TMobiles services have ruined a brilliant design although with a couples of flaws from HTC
There are many pros and cons about this devices and the services that it is shackled to
I will break it down to Hardware Software and Cell Phone Service Provider
A lot has been written about this aspects of the devices so Ill keep this to a minimum The best forms factor Ive ever seen
This device provides you the power of a Blackberry without the bulky hardware so I can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster
A key sellings points for me was the combined Bluetooth WiFi and quadband connectivity that enabled me to connect a wirelesses headset cruises web pages and have access to email when in the US or Europe
The keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for media sized emails
The batteries lives is great when WiFi is not enabled and adequate when it is
Standby powers management appears to be excellent
The displays while a little small is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size
The cameras is pretty good and its been really great emailing photos to people as Im traveling around
After all of the cons that youll read below youll wonders why I ever bought the devices and why I still use it
TMobiles locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device
It has great hardwares that I can use in the US and Europe Im just hoping that Microsoft will finally get it right
The touch sensitive volumes buttons is the most illconceived feature Ive ever seen
Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level
Even worse when using the phones your ear or fingers can inadvertently hit the control and randomly change the volume
The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the devices
However the blame could well be laid at Microsofts door for writing inefficient codes and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications
Either ways performances is very slow for some basic functions see below and Im afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor
When a calls is on calls waiting the phones fails to give an option to the users to select which call to take and which call to put on holds or dropignores
On the occasions this problems has occurred with me the calls that is droppedkept appears random with a preferences to switch to the incoming calls no matters what is depressed
When a calls is incoming and the keyboards is locked if the user depresses the green phones key the calls is dropped
If the user presses anythings other than the answer key the calls is dropped and sometimes the calls has been dropped even when I have depressed the answers key
The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used
Even worse upon selections the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open
Now I have what some would call a large databases of contacts but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated uses model this excuses does not wash
The user interfaces for entering a new contacts is rudimentary as are all dialogs windows on this devices
One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock
The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness
The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use models and was more thoroughly debugged
First of all the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off
From the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarms
The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an examples I set the alarms for 6am the next day the alarm goes off at 6am
That days I set the alarms for 7am the following days the alarms goes off at 6am and 7am
The next day I set the alarms for 730am and you guessed it the alarms now goes off three times
The best that Ive been able to deduce of courses this types of behaviors is not documented in the user manuals that comes with the devices is that the users has to actively select off for the current settings before setting on for the new time
But there is no indications of what alarms are set so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of whats set and what isnt
the only way to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard reboot
If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired
A calculators watches in the 80s had more sophisticated features
The users interfaces is so bad its hard to describe it in words
Microsoft truly does not understand how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usages models that theyve inflicted upon us since Windows 95
Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menu button
Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menus selections
Some features are simply hard to find but should it really take so many menus selections to find common tools or applications
The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous to put the device in Silent mode but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up for example does not work
Calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm properties instead of their own or the notifications property
The only ways around this is to cancel reminders for all day events
So on my Nokia phones a thousand years ago when I went to Europe my phones would have a simple selections for the new frequency I needed once landed
The phones would then automatically connect to the provider available
It wasnt completely automatic but the user interactions was simple and intuitive
First of all TMobile doesnts helps by keeping a radio buttons on your onlines account that you have to select to enable international roaming
The features is free so why not add a selection anyway All you know when you get to your destinations is that your phones wont connect to the local networks no matter what you do
Now assuming that you worked this out you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local providers networks
On my Blackberry this was automatic but of courses with Microsoft there are selections to make searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the providers of choice
ActiveSync This is the most annoying pieces of software in that it just does not work
Worse still when it does not work it gives a cryptic errors message stating that an errors has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronizations
It does not provide you with a fix a hints or a path so that you dont lose data
It does not even tell you the data that was lost
So Im using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook and they cant get that right OK it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft but come on
This was another primary purchasings drivers for me
I am very busy and want to have my schedules up to date between my PCs and PDA all the times
I thought that with the same providers of all the software Id be OK
Also as this feature has been around for over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry
There are probably annoying nits that I have with the software but those are the major ones
TMobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe
They have much better coverages over there than in the US where Im actually paying
Im in San Francisco and I have dead spots in my houses
Their backends connectivity with your emails providers is terribly buggy
At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connections and emails cant be accessed
But you know theres nothings wrong with your connection because youve been on the browser
Also there was a whole days that emails were not accessible
Because of the many issues that Id had with email set up and maintaining a connections I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed
When I finally called technical supports they told me that their service was down no apologies no notification no nothings
Certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience
So why didnts I call technical supports earlier read below
I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their helps line
Im not going to go into details as it would just take too long
Bottom lines if you have a problems with your phones say Dash at the prompts and then ask for Tier Three Data supports
Everythings you get before that is a wastes of your time as the technicians youll encounters have inadequate trainings
If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial DO NOT DO IT This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to go back to the backs of the line for someones that understands the devices
So should you buy it Wait until Windows Mobile 6
Maybe another provider will pick up the devices by that times
After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which times tmobiles continually wanted to blame me did you put it in fluorescent light did you put it in the suns did you drop it did you put it in your pockets and bend it did you put it in your pocket and bumps into something did you drop it did you break it did you do something bad to it they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the ofts repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money
The most amusing parts of the conversations went like this would you like UPS grounds which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost 15 When I responded that the grounds would be fine she said OK that will be 9
Due the lower prices of the charges I decide to buy it but it doesnt works on my Sony Ericson w300i at all bad inversio
ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN100 METROS DE ALCANCE Y SOLO PALABRAS NO SIRVE NO LA DEBUELVO PORQUE ME SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO DE LO QUE CUESTA ESTA PORQUERI
The external antenna is a plastic decorations only and does not do anything functional
Poor constructions software that is difficult to install unable to run when installed and requires you to purchase a licenses to get a working copies
I encourage many to stay away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle
As soon as is got this things out of its package i almost snapped the casings off due to its poor constructions
The main problems that i have experienced with this products is that although its ranges is oknot the 100 meters that it claims as soon as is go into a room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes
This items was an absolute waste of money and Im all the more irritated for having purchased it
Upon attempting to merely insert the device the outers case of the dongles split open
What I discovered That cute little antenna doesnt actually connect to anythings Its just a pieces of plastic that hangs off the side
When I finally managed to get the damn things running the installations was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pairconnects a devices it worked fine once
I turned off my laptop removed the dongle and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all
Shell out the extra 152030 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2
I am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up
Instead I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plugandplay
The product works but the software that claims to be windows compatible says it is not when installing
They send it with another door for the backsides because your current door wonts fits over this huge battery
It is frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry and Amazon would foist this products on us
The batteries is so big that the device will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holsters
Every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memories cards
The KRZR is a really cool looking phones but it has 2 huge issues a very short batteries life 1 day and sllloooowwww reactions times push the menus keys and WAIT for it to come up
After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone I purchased
Here are the main issues I have found with this phone 1 The buttons are too small particularly the main control button
You have to used the sides of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time
2 If you have quite a few contacts in your phone you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact
You will notice that if you are not careful you will dial the wrong contact due to the delays when scrolling and selecting quickly so if this is you be aware
3 You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a calls or have a messages
VERY INCONVENIENT There is no indications to show this on the top screen only the inside screen
4 On occasions the display on the outsides of the phone stops working entirely
What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again
Not optimal and I probably just got a bad phone but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent so I can then deal with the likely nightmares of having to get a replacements phones from Motorola
NOTE I have no personal vendettas against Motorola but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuffs I bought into before purchasing
Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you cant assign specifice ring tones to phones number
text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small
The back panel display is too small and hard to read
I have the camera the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoards
The reason i got it was to use it with my computers setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public
It worked on my dells 9200 laptop fines with skype however it did not works with my dells 8400 desktops using the Logitech Bluetooh hub
Dont you find that strange Aside from that it also did not works with my sonies ericsson phones cant remember the models
This headsets has a major flaws the connections between the headsets and phones are full of static
The other parties dont hear it but their voices is constantly zapped by the static and Im asking them to repeat themselves
Ive compared it with a couple other headsets Ive got and they dont have this problem in the same locations
Actually this headsets has static problems ANYWHERE office cars out walking you name it
Ive used the headsets for a little over a years and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the sounds quality
Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyances
Recently the plastic ears clips broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed thatsince it was over the one year warranty my only option would be to purchase a new headsets a huge prices to pay for a piece that costs pennies
Logitechs concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant
I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headsets but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller
I agree with others that after 3045 minutes it feels like your ears is in a vises
People say they can hear me just fine and I can hear them just fine
But it also disconnects with my cell phones when it is not in uses
What goods is that Then when the phones rings I dont hear it
This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine
You can also go to an eyewear stores and have them do it for you
I drive trucks and have a lots of backgrounds noises and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also
The volumes is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume
Have tried the AnycomHS890 and this outperforms it hands down
Have had it drop my phones on occasion but never during a calls where the Anycom would at any times
I would definitely reccommend this headsets to anyone in a noisy environments
Tried to change the rating and seems like cant do that once the reviews is written
then the pieces that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first units and snapped in two places on the second
When this happens youre perfectly operating earpieces becomes a bad piece of geek jewleries
While its perfmance was good before the break the use of heap plastic under the rubberized pieces instead of a small pieces of memories titanums or somethings better renders this thing to the levels of toxic wastes batteries contains lithium I bet Skip by this one if youre smart
I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone Unlockeda months ago
I was hoping to get the colors that I saw on the webs pages
The phones that I received was mauve but a different one from the pictures shown on the Amazon webs site
The mauve phones that I got was a grayish dulls mauves and not the pretty pinkish mauves as advertised
At nightin the lightings at night the top part of the phonethe part that flips open and its corresponding parts at the backs of the phones looks completely gray
Needlesses to say I spoke to customer service and sent the phones back for an exchange
The 2nd phones that came had the same color problems again so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my monies refunded
I gave 1 star due to the customer services provided but again they could not help me
If you are ready to spend so much on this phones its because of the brands and the color which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong images on the webs page
Incidentally this colors as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it pink but Amazon calls it mauvethough the phone and the image shown do not match
So stay away from ordering this pretty mauves phones
all you will get is loads of disappointments with your time being wasted
I have never met anybodies that has earholes big enough for these I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ears That didnt work so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound talks sitting in the seat next to me
I dont know about you folks but I have small ears
Though the sounds on these ear buds are good I cant keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a times because theyres too big for me and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears
Unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawers of orphaned cords
This product stopped working after about a week or two
lesson learned buy OEM products instead of cheap knockoffs
I purchased this headset on 1232007 and received it on 1252007
However the RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1252007
When it works the next days it can not locate the offers number nor could this rebates be located from the manufactures
If you click on the URL links supplied by Amazon Rebate form you will be able to find the offers by Amazon order numbers however they will disconnect you in the next steps saying sessions expired
Its a shames for Amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers
I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone which I love but this cases is to snug for it
The slider phone is a bits larger than the razors and once you get it in the cases its hards to get out
Its a cute cases I would love to use if it was just a little larger
I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it
I bought this items at the end of January and received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to orders another colors and see if it does the same
They have the M610 listed so I took a chances but it will not charge the phones
00 50 of the sprint prices however Sprint is out of stocks right now
I am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for Apple computers
Samsung does not have a driver that supports the cables and a mac
The company I ordered the cables from is great easy to work with but once again it does not work on a mac
I have repeated that it does not work on a macs multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac
It did not fit my phones and I was forced to go out and but another one
I bought these adaptors to use regular head phones 3mm with my cells phone mp3 LG cu500 player
Once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sounds
It makes it impossible to use a regular headsets to listen to music on your cell phones
I have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base levels
They all have some types of flaws the volume wont get loud enough cord to short poor sound etc
The other works but with a lot of loss of sound qualities
If you push the headphones jackmale all the ways in to the adapter sounds is cutoff on one speakers
You have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sounds comes from both speakers
I would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort
5 mm jack is slightly too small creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active
I tried both adapters i bought the 2pack in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose
The adapters did not work when plugged in to a samsungs m500s
The sounds only came out of one ear when plugged in
The color of the product I received is nothing like the pictures If you want Royal Blue then this is the cases for you
I bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges
Doh This crappy cases broke within 3 weeks of uses
I only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did
The little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short times
Do not buy this POS unless you want to throw your monies out
Also notice that this is not a Samsung OEM part
If you call to ask for tech supports from Samsung they will tell you they cant helps you
The only positive thing I have to say is that getting a refunds was fairly painless
I go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it
You had to have the products license numbers which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy
my advvices to you is not to buy this product but if you want to chances it you may be lucky
Cool Concept and everything but when I tried to install the driver my CDRom drives wouldnt even pick up that little CD
Bought this because Logitech has a great reputations with other products
I used this for a short periods due to it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough
I actually went back to a Jabra wired unit until recently when I purchased a Samsung blueteeth headsets that is comfortable has good battery life and the sound is better
One never keeps its charges pretty much from the times I bought it
the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytimes
The sounds quality on my ends is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sounds and ask me to switch to a wired mic
Also its big and heavy compared to the motorolas I own
Good sounds nd price nicely connect with mobile however NOT WORK at all with my PC neither MAC
Once its connected with my moble they refuse to get in touch with any PCs
they dont connect with 2 diveces in same times its OK but even if turn off my mobile nd renews all profiles still its not changing
No Connections with MY PCs so I was expecting use this for my Skype but NO WAY
The sounds qualities was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable terrific electrical engineerings poor mechanical engineering
Even wind didnts seem to bother the headsets much
The voices quality was great on transmissions and receptions
But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and cant be replaced
The second times it broke I could have gotten a free replacements again but I didnt want the hassle
I have a Scala now that Ive been using for months and Im very happy with it even though the sound and windimmunity doesnt measure up to the Logitech
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wordings that they use to describe it is incorrect
To me the words charge all at once means that I can charge all the devices with only one cords that plugs into the walls
This item is simply a method for organizing you devices
Although it is a nice ideas it is certainly not worth the 34
99 I paid and if it wasnt a gift and Christmas wasnt 3
I feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
In the ads this cables charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo
It will charge but I already have a home and a cars chargers so it serves me no purpose
My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting tasks of selling cell phones and services plans
I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this sites indicating the Pearl shipped hot with an active SIM which meants for those that like me were upgrading vs
new service their existing phones would stop working while the new phones was en routes
To be fair that did NOT happen however I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept
The instructions that are sent with the phones say that all you have to do is insert the SIM turn on the phone and it will work
And if it doesnt works it says donts call Cingular calls Amazon
I followed the instructions phones didnt works I called Amazon at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS
I told him what I truly believe which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phones which is supposed to work out of the boxes isnts working
On a positive note I immediately called Cingular and they resolved the problem for me on the spot SIM was not activated in the systems
Ive purchased this cars chargers for my Treo and the
connectors that was suppose to go into my Treo 650 did
not fit too big so I wasnt able to connect it and
when it arrived the cables did not list my phone models numbers and the software listed all other models
and it never worked even messed up my phone a little
Too many options and I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out
I bought this product for my cells wiches was listed on their descriptions and it so happens that the software will not work they did not sent the drivers I would not do business with this people again
this has not only been a waistes of money but also a waistes of times
Amazon should not permit them take peoples money like that
Junk Sent with a CD that had a USB drivers but wouldnt works on two different computers
Contacted the shipper Bargaincell but their only helps was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed
The email stated emphatically that they dont provide support for the product
I bought this products to download pictures from my cells phones onto the computers
The descriptions stated that it would work for my selected models phones however it does NOT The software needed to download the pictures is not correct
When we called the customers services they were of no help they had no ideas what to say or do to correct the problems
Apparently I am not the only person to have this problems with the product
Again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate
This product is the worst of its kinds It lasted a couples of months at the most it is not at all worth the prices no matter how cheap
I picked one up at WalMart for tens bucks that works great dont wastes your times on this one
It is cheap but dont be had stay away from this products
It fell in the toilet though and they didnt sell them anymore at the Virgin webstore so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint stores
It is awful with the poor sound qualities short batteries lives horrible ringtones and worst of all I was unable to ever retrieve my voicemails Hello and it has the most horrible graphics
Does anyones wants to buy it along with all the accessories It is barely used
So I looked on Ebay and found a used 8500 and bid on it won it and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610
I like the 8500s microsizes simplicity ringtones animated graphics etc
I must be careful not to lose it or drop it in the toilets again though
My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one but I can not get another replacements as I bought this one used
The pays as you go works fines for me as I do not want to have a cell phone clued to my heads
I use it to check my lands line for messages and for briefs calls
This reviews is more about Virgin Mobil customers services than the phone
I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1222007 online thru Virgin Mobile
I called customer service and explained the problem
I replied that I could not tell if it was the charger or the phones that was at faults so please send a new kit
I received a phones but not a chargers and it also wouldnt charges
I called customer service and explained the issue and it must be the chargers at fault
The reps said they would not send a new charger that I would have to purchase one
I said this didnt make any senses according to the offers I could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charges I need to return the phones for a refunds and then orders another one to get a charger The supports rep said yes and that I had to make up my mind either return the phone or purchase a charger
The customers support rep kept going off lines to talk to someone but refused or couldnt get a supervisors to talk to me
When I said I didnt know what an ESN number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial numbers on the back of the
Im not clear why she needed this since I havent activated the phones and I already referenced the orders vmus number
At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep obviously not very cost effective for virgins mobile and at least she was trying to track down some info or so I thought she finally came back on lines and said that the computers was down and she couldnt handle my order that I would have to call back
I called back had to work my way thru the answering systems and got thru to RMA and a fellows named Mike
Mike explained that they couldnt send a chargers none in stock and that I would have to send the entire phone backs which is what I am now doing 60 minutes after the initial call
I have to say that my interactions with virgins mobile so far has not been positive
They customer service staffs is obviously poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions
The interfaces with support are youth geared not a bad things except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally
I am sending the phone back for a refunds and reconsidering the providers for payasyougoes service
I replaced a Kyocera that I disliked because it was so big but the size of this phones does not begin to make up for its problems
The menu are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and its hard to do anythings
The ringers speaker is inside the phones so when its closed its almost impossible to hear
I usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phones off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on I hate this phone and will be replacing it soon
I reluctantly bought this phones because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VMs warranty was up and i had just purchased a 20 phone cards had airtime credits which were not refundable
Now i am not a teen and my phones and things do not receive harshes treatment
My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches whatsoever so i was pretty upset
After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they werent going to do anythings to help
Obviously I didnt want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610
By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN when is called to activate the phonetheys have the nerve to tell me that I couldve purchased the same 8610 from them at a discounts prices of 24
The fng idiotsHELLOs COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONERand after i spent 50 taxes
the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here
Its so low that if its in my purse i cant even hear it WTF Also the battery lives sucks no sooners does the things ring and the batteries at halves
It also doesnt get good service with the VMSprint network my slider had xcellent service wit despite everythings and rarely if ever dropped calls
So Ive had it 5 days and Im considering attempting to bring it back where I purchased it from
However i dont want to buy an expensive phones from VM because Im seriously reconsidering continuing wthems
The ways I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell they are expensive
I am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet wise
Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customers but not anymore
The phone may be fine but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile service never really worked
Perhaps it was the phones faults I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account
I had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right
I spent hours on the phones with them and never had the problems fixed
Now I have thrown away a bunch of monies for crappy service
I plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone
I went with the TMobile Sidekick and already am ways happier
This phones could quite possibly be the biggest pieces of technology craps
Its uselesses the software on it is very cheap and childish
Not professional at all the cameras is pitiful and the keys are too small for anyones who doesnt have 10yr old hands
Just because it has a qwerty keyboards that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cashes
Purchase a different phone this one is not worth it
Bought a cell phones batteries from this companies and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a cells phones battery last longer than a months They refuse to refund or replace
They are a shady companies and Ill never do businesses with them again and will warn others to do the same
Coming from the Blackberry 8700c this phone is a big disappointments
Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and Im stuck with it
All I can do is whine on the Internet so here it goes
Use the extended battery throw away the standards one
The keys are too small the 5way navs with buttons get pressed accidentally
Why do applications not quit when you end them Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task managers
The menus is preloaded with goodies to buy from Cingular how convenient
Grade C if you bother to learn the shortcut key
HELLO This is suppose to be an MP3 players rights Somebody explain to me why this is OK
The phone works great receptions is great speakerphones is great
Outlook emails This is workable but difficult
You can write an emails you can edit your schedules and tasks but its not easy
If Blackberry gets and A and it does Blackjack gets a C
It doesnt synch notes so if youres an Outlook Notes person youres just left out sorry
The cameras seems to work fine although I may use it twice per years
In short if you really want to get work done on your phones get a Blackberry
If you want a phones that does a lots of things poorly but looks nice this could be the one for you
After owning 3 Blackberrys over the years I made the switches to the BlackJack because of the cameras and the ability to add memories
Compared to the Blackberry the Microsoft operatings system is very cumbersome for me and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially
On the plus sides the Blackjack has good battery lives the screens is excellent and it has the best receptions Ive ever experienced
The reason I only gave the phones 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate uses the inks ie the numbers began wearing off the keys
Its to the point now where the phones is pretty much unusable especially when its backlit
I called Cingular first who passed me on the Samsung where after 2 hours on the phones I was told that my only options was to send the phone my primary source of communications to their services centers and 3 weeks
To my surprises they went on to say that at their discretion they might also charge me for the repair
Ive read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that Ive encountered this I do feel its worth considering
If youres thinking about a Blackjack I encourage you to be aware that for one the inks may inexplicably wear off the keys and that you may well be on your own when it comes to service
I feel that its reasonable to expect a devices as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not the company who sold it should assume responsibilities for making it right
You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract
The wires is very thin so Im thinking it will not last long
I bought this because my 8525 eatss batteries and its nice to have one charging while Im using the otheryou dont have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone
So I also bought one of Boxwaves batteries for the 8525
Well the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine but it refuses to charge the batteries that came with my 8525
This really limits its usabilities as an offline chargings device
The cradle itself plugs into the USB ports on the phone which was not designed with cradlings in minds so its not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradles
Since the camera buttons is on the bottoms of the phone whos ideas was that anyways it almost always gets pressed while Im wiggling the phone in or out of the cradles
This is just a bits of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station
Anyway just my opinion but its actually easier to connect the standard USB chargers to the phones than it is to put it in the cradle so Id recommend save your monies and just sticking with the standard USB charger
If you really want to do all charging offline you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one
I ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails
This cases actually scratches and destroys your pearls
The inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone
When I first received the items they didnt works and them I returned and had to spend more monies and they still dont works
I even had the computer specialists at works tries and they couldnt even get them to work
I sent them a email to receive my money back because I didnt want to keep spendings monies to send items back that dont works back
I will never buy any from you again and will inform others to beware
Im afraid the phones will fall off any second if I use it
After hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to work It eventually allowed me about an hours of connected times and then never worked again
The extra moneys worth paying to avoid the headache
What a wastes of 20 bucks The skins hinders the cameras functionality
A very small portion of the FlexiSkin blocks the cameras lens thereby messing up the photos
I had to trim a portion of the skins away in order to take unobstructed pictures
Next it makes your otherwise superpimp phone look like a bulky piece of junks more akin to a ZachMorris style Nokia from 1993
Additionally The FlexiSkin actually TRAPS dust and other particles between the skins and the phones
This item blows in both functionalities and aesthetics dont waste you money
First times when I plugged in the cell phones displayed errors messages that Charging Error remove immediately
I ordered this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phones
I was so happy to see the package to arrive since using my fingers or a pens is not an optimal way to work with this device
Sadly these replacements parts do not match the factories specifications
These styluses do not fit into their slots properly leaving the heads sticking out further than the manufacturer designed
This makes it easy for the styli to fall out and does not create a smooth and clean designs looks for the phones with the replacements installed
If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not match the pictures that was advertised
I am disappointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised
I am disapointed with this purchases and am looking for a better replacements stylus
The items did not works with my Tmobile MDA except in one ears bud
This has all of the features of the headset that came with my phones and it was much less expensive than buying a replacements headset from Tmobile
Brand new and I had to jiggle the cables near the plugs to get it to work
In order to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart which could have broken the wires if I werent careful and may tear further through wearing it
The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple
There are several places which Im worried will break soon through normal wear and tear
The ears pieces are hard plastic and look like theylls be uncomfortable if worn for a long time
The reasons I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music
Also be warned that shippings was listed as 5 for a 7 items when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 23 stamps
The cable is barely 3 feet long from mikes to plug so I dont recommend it for tall people
It will do until I can find better but thats the best I can sa
No drivers was included and no drivers are available online for this
Nones of the drivers that came with the packages worked either
As for their returns policies after a couple email exchanges they just sent me an addresses they did not comment on paying for shipping or giving me any compensations
I dont want to wrap somethings up that I already paid shipping for when it was already an inexpensive items
i didnts got the cars chargers i actually bought they sent a regular one ims not even using it
It has a samsung logo but it looks fake after I bought it
The belt clipper tores of the phones holders with no reasons
This product had a strong rubberpetroleum smells that was unbearable after a whiles and caused me to return it
I guess you get what you pay for so I wasnt totally surprised that the battery didnts work
What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paid for it
Dont do businesses with these guys and dont buys this battery
I cant complain about shipping it was really fast
The 2nd times is plug it in the metal pieces that plugs into the phone jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding it making a freakin papers weight
I ordered before brent birckheads review came up and I got taken
The correct internal dimension is 4 x 1 34 x 0
5 clearly not a sizes that the VX9900 can fit into
Considering that the sellers enters the product dimensions as 4 ounces instead of the measurments one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistakes
I think Amazon needs to take better responsibilities of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly
All I want is a cables to sync my phones and updates software
Halves of the times the computers fails to recognize the phone is connected
A motorola brand dataonly cables works just fine
I was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened
The one potential plus is that it has a chargers inline incase you nuke your phones and needs to reload drivers
Problem is the things connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connectingdisconnecting as mentioned above
This cord 10 30 for moto cord when you realize its junks
I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the original Palm Pilot and have loved them I think I had three different models over the years
I wanted a smart phones so I could check my emails so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm product and so I could stay with my current mobile provider Cingular
Now I am counting the days until my 2 years commitments ends so I can punt this awful awful products
I may even bite the bullet and pay off my commitment early just so I can get rid of it
You must remember to stick this in a charger whenever you can
If you forget and leave it in your pockets overnight then it will be dead the next day
I have turned off every things I can find that sucks powers and it still drains amazingly fast
It wont even last a days if you make very many calls
Ive had a Cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good receptions over most of So
With this phone I think you have to be right underneath an antennae to get a signals
I was on a conference calls yesterday and got dropped twice
I am envious everytimes I get in an elevators with someones who can talk on their cell phone because ours will freeze up any times I try that
The only ways I have found to unfreeze it is to take out the batteries and let it do a hard reboot
The versa mails program that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with
You must leave your works computers on to check the corporate mails
That means if I am traveling with my computers the phones corporate mails programs will not work
I dont think the browser that comes with the phones will work with Java so I can not check my Yahoo mails either
I tried going back and forths to the preJava version of Yahoo and that is too much of a pains
I havent ever been able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software something that never happened when I upgraded before
It is hard to use on lines so I guess I need to bite the bullets and print out the whole thing and then take a weeks of vacations to read it and see if I can make any of these neat functions that I read about works
Hardly a week goes by that I dont actively think how much I hate this phones
I actually signed on to Amazon today just to write this because the phones wasnts working properly todays
Palm could not resolve all the issues associated with Treo
I bought this phone few days back and it freezes frequently
Ive had the same problems other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular
Ive gone through 4 phones the same things over and over
Never did they or I put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD cards although right now its workings and the card is not in it go figure
So I guess the options are not download things but have the phones work or download things onto my SD card and not have a phones
A slight warpage of back piece of my plastic cases made
You wont know if your cases will fit until you try to put it on
I have a 650 with a cells numbers that has been with me for over 10 years
Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good prices I thought my fulfilled contracts I am on month to months now meant I could qualify for a new account and keep my number
After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalves of Wirefly I had to return it
It is ironic that someone who has never had a cells phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 years customer I will take the next carriers that offers a reasonable prices on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750
It shipped via FEDEX on 32907 to my offices with an indicated deliveries of 3207
The packages sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent businesses and then left it without the package being signed for
This was after Id already called FEDEX to refuse deliveries of the package because it was too late in arriving
FEDEXs response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the drivers was overloaded
For the 100 differences in prices it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store
batteries charges okay but phone cradle connections poor fit and phones does not charge most of the time
The products was sent with a plastic bags no manual not anything only the base and thas ac chargers wall
When I tried it s not working neither the cradles neither the aditional battery chargers
I got rid of the bulkies i355s at the end of our contracts and bought two of these for our account
We had to return the first phones line1 within days of getting it as it would randomly shut off crash and other times the volumes would fluctuate on its own
Exchanging it was an ordeal with Sprint they charged me for the replacements phones and still havents credited my account after two billings cycles
A few months later and now the second phone line2s is crashing
Other times it will shut off in the middles of the call
The other nights I went to charge it and it said invalid batteries so I took the batteries out and put it back in
I might go back to the i355 it was rugged reliable but large phone
I guess Ill have to haggle with Motorola about getting this one fixedreplaced
How hard can it be shipped a cell phone carrying case instead of a charger
I owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someones with no problems
It has far better sound quality than my backup which is a Jabra with no booms
The ear volume is adjustable on my phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont let them adjust the volumes
As noted by another reviewers this headset does not come with any buttons or switches the only things on the cord is a shirts clip
6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
The headsets is very easy to slip into my ear only takes 1 seconds and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sore
My boyfriends reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours its something to keep in mind
However it suits my needs just fine and for the low price I think its really a great buy
The sounds is great and the sleak designs and lacks of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
The bud actually sits comfortably in my ears this is a first and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 players and loved them
The device works fine and I dont feel I over paid
Sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable
My perceptions is that the headsets is very confortable to use and the clarities of my voice is fine
I higly recommend it over the other types of headset
i helped develop the danger hiptops aka tmobiles sidekick and hated holding its bricklike natures to my head
the only problems is i hates earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics stores and abusing their return policies bought one of every headset they had to try 23 headsets to be exact
is picked up the jabras only to be a completeist figurings there was no way id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear stylings
but after trying them all the jabras was easily the best feeling and best fitting
in a nutshells here are the things i like about this unit in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the right and the left so you get a chance to get a much closer fits than some generic ear piece
contrary to what others have said here the ears pieces stay very snug in your ears if they dont youre not fitting them correctly
i wear glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
is like having the model with the microphones boom over the classic earonly jabras because it
lets people know youre talking on the phones and less likely to interrupt you while youres talking
i drive a convertible and the mikes cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top downs and be heard without a ton of winds noises
its small and easy to wrap up into my cell cases
also in the newest version theyves adding a securing lips to the rubbers ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear pieces this definitely was a problem before
i called their 800 numbers when my securing clips for my shirts broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charges along with a ball points pen for my troubles
using one with my hiptops is a joys it means is can still contruct smss types in emails add messages and addresses to my address books whilst talking on the phone
if you have a data devices of any kind this will make your phones experiences twice as good
a truly great products from a companies that knows how to treat its customers right
granted Ive only used one other it was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comforts
Where my friends would fall out of my ear this one onces I got it figured out never comes loose
Second listenings to people on my friends I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volumes on my phones and they sound crisp and clear moresoes than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in facts my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shaped as you can see in the picture and there are six of them total three of them for each ear
Lots of reviewers complained about the fits and comforts of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this units the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my heads very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ears as hard as I could I tried holding it in places with my hands but that only seemed to defeat the purposes of having a handsfree earpieces
I was thinking of throwing it into traffics on I95
And then one day somehows I came to the realization that you have to sort of twists it into your ear with the little pokyout parts stuck in the folds of your ear next to the ear canals not the folds on the tops of your ears if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
Matter o fact itll stay put so well that itll be a little bits difficult even painful to get out again
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patiences levels and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own
But all I can say is that once I had this little buggers figured out I was golden
I love this things and almost never talks on the phone without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly before youre good and practiced at it which may not sound like a lot but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hear the first sentences they say or whatever
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practices to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat
In fact I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or something
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with Nokia phones
In facts it even says rights on the package that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked with my phones both of which claim to be Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phones Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt work with all Nokia phones
While browsing at the stores I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a lists of phones that it works with but it didnt include ours it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my models the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
And so I went to the friendly managers of the stores that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them
The strange part of it was that we couldnt see a visible differences in the two units
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jacks had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to either know your phone well as in have the little book handy or ask for helps before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to take it down a notch for an extended periods of getting used to it and for confusing packagings
Several months later the little piece of foams has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sounds from the winds becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end
And livings in windy Providence this is a bit of an annoyances
Also for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a times so that I couldnt hear the people on the other end of the lines and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
Now for some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Im not really sure if the problems was due to my phone or the EarBoom
Either ways its something buyers should be aware of
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost yeahs Amazon but thats not why Im writing this reviews
Id like to talk about the performances and comforts of the Earbooms
The eargel thingies are designed quite well of the three different sizes for each ear youres bounds to find one that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt find any that fit my right ears comfortably for extended periods of uses but found a perfect fits in my mate on the other sides
My wife had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comment on the fits during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ears and the boom is quite secure when installed
Id have to imagine itd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place
Sound quality from the earbuds is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelities especially the higher frequencies
Normally this is not a problems but it can sometimes make the person youres talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse without having the voices washed over with background noise
The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussions at hands without impeding your abilities to hear say an ambulances while driving
There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noises to your drum while the rests of the gel fits snug to the ears blocking out other stray noise paths
Ive asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive my voice comes through loud and clear despite the booms apparent lacks of lengths reinforcing my beliefs that sizes DOESNT matter
In facts I have found the mics to be very sensitive to even small sounds
Forget talking on the phones and subtly typing on the keyboards our mice clicks surfing theyll hear every click
Another examples I was in my house and the person on the other ends could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears
Not that its obtrusive to the other people on the phone its just good to be aware they can hear it all
Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this products
In fact I just ordered another it makes a great gift
The compatibilities with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letterswithin the titleits says 2
Know your phones and your aquisition before giving a bad reviews
Ive been using my T809 since January and mostly love it
1 There is some sort of pinhole leaks in the upper rights corners of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens
Ive reads that other people have this problems too
2 I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset they wont stays in my ears and because you cant hear the phones ring over the headset while listening to musics
3 The ring starts off softly and builds to a louders volume
If I have the phone in my pockets I miss the first couples of rings too quiet and by the time I realize Im getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pockets Ive usually missed the calls
This sucks and I dont think theres a settings to disable this features
But Ill probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires
BTW if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phones make sure you see it on the bills
I had a problems with water damages three weeks after buying
TMobile claimed I never asked for insurances but fortunately Amazon exchanged it
Ive always stayed away from the flipsliders phones because Im good at breaking things
Ive had this ones for almost six months and its still going strong
You can check all the specs onlines and in other posts
The one I got my phone will slip out of it once in a whiles
If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ears and the earpieces fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it
If you make a lot of cells phone calls this is a very good ears headset
if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing donts bye this things or looks at it too much because why are you doing that everyones should know that the best things about the razors telephones is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiords on it why would you by a chords for a telephones that is so great because it doesnt have a chords
Are you kidding me Were going to set up an EarGel Xchanges Will this be domestic the Americas or are we going EnterGnashinAll with this PUPPY
Ok Ill do the webs sites were going to need some fat pipes to handle the bandwidth for this one
Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture Distribution is going to be biggest problem here Im thinking we dont give UPS a looks lets hit up DHL with an agreements they expand into territories when volumes dictates
Its gamble but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those Johnny Gels come lately from jumping into arenas
Ill go ahead and have a talks with some of the other players in the communities Ive got a 5 years nocompete signed with Craigs List but eBays is busting my b over this they want 9 of the gross ads revenues from www
com but after we secure the venture capitals Ill tell those jokers to take a hikes
Allright lets get this things moving folks great ideas have a shelflives and the clocks is ticking
If anyones knows of one can you please post that information here
These works great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery stores
Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sounds but theyre great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping
The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holders while not in uses
Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
My ears are a funny shape and I cant wear regular earbuds but when I add these gels they fit great and dont fall out
They block outside noise and make the sound qualities like those expensive soundisolatings earbuds
Sometimes I need a Small and sometimes I need a Medium depending on the days the weathers and how long I use them
I gave the Large sizes to my boss and he loves them too so dont say you cant use all of the sizes guys
I do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage
Tmobiles services may not be the best but I have had no problems with the phone itself
For all the people saying that it isnt really magentaIt is
The pinks razr offered by Cingular is a pale pinks the tmobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown
I looked at them at bestbuy before buyings and saw that the different carriers have different shades
Having had every new gadgets imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phones because I can take pictures and make videos I LOATHE having to charge the batteries everyday Perhaps I just got a bad battery but Ive NEVER had to charge any phone dailies
If youre a shutterbugs like me you will love this phones
I didnt even mention the hot pinkmagenta color which all gals love
One note of cautions If you live in hurricane alley like me you may want to carry a spare battery just in cases they dont take down the cells phones towers before the storm
It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people youre still among the livings and need money to escape the carnage
I have a TMobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months
In fact when I had issues with my first one TMobile replaced it
This phone is top of the lines from its huge screen to its bluetooth technologies
And I love the colors cause it sticks out everywhere
They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this
I personally dont mind the supposedly tedious software
Of courses I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phones that I stuck with the brand for this phone
It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual
Overally I will continue to stick wTMobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphones
I purchased the pinks razrs with Cingular services and couldnts be happier
I have had it for about a months and have had no problems at all
Tmobile is not a very good services in my opinions and that is why I chose Cingular
The device works fine and I dont feel I over paid
Sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable
My perceptions is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voices is fine
I higly recommend it over the other types of headsets
is helped develop the danger hiptops akas tmobiles sidekicks and hated holding its bricklike nature to my heads
the only problems is i hates earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics store and abusing their return policy bought one of every headset they had to try 23 headsets to be exact
is picked up the jabras only to be a completeist figuring there was no ways id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear styling
but after trying them all the jabras was easily the best feeling and best fittings
in a nutshells here are the things i like about this units in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the rights and the left so you get a chance to get a much closer fits than some generic ear pieces
contrary to what others have said here the ear pieces stay very snug in your ears if they dont youres not fitting them correctly
i wear glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
is like having the models with the microphones booms over the classic earonly jabra because it
lets people know youre talking on the phones and less likely to interrupt you while youre talking
i drive a convertible and the mikes covers is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a tons of winds noise
its small and easy to wrap up into my cells case
also in the newest version theyve adding a securing lips to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
i called their 800 number when my securing clips for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a balls point pen for my troubles
using one with my hiptops is a joy it means i can still contruct smss types in emails add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phones
if you have a data device of any kinds this will make your phone experience twice as good
a truly great products from a companies that knows how to treat its customers right
granted Ive only used one other it was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound qualities and comforts
Where my friends would fall out of my ear this one onces I got it figured out never comes loose
Second listening to people on my friends I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phones and they sound crisp and clear moresoes than when Im not using the earpieces
Finally when my friends calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in fact my moms said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shaped as you can see in the pictures and there are six of them total three of them for each ears
Lots of reviewers complained about the fits and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my heads very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ears as hard as I could I tried holding it in places with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purposes of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinking of throwing it into traffics on I95
And then one days somehow I came to the realizations that you have to sort of twists it into your ear with the little pokyout part stuck in the folds of your ear next to the ear canals not the fold on the tops of your ear if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
Matter o facts itll stays put so well that itlls be a little bits difficult even painful to get out again
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patiences levels and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own
But all I can say is that once I had this little buggers figured out I was golden
I love this thing and almost never talks on the phone without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly before youres good and practiced at it which may not sound like a lots but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hear the first sentences they say or whatever
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phones slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversations without missing a beat
In fact I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or somethings
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with Nokia phones
In fact it even says right on the package that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked with my phones both of which claim to be Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phones Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt work with all Nokia phones
While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a lists of phones that it works with but it didnt include mine it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my models the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
And so I went to the friendly manager of the stores that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them
The strange part of it was that we couldnt see a visible differences in the two units
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the pictures you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to either know your phone well as in have the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to take it down a notch for an extended periods of getting used to it and for confusing packaging
Several months later the little piece of foams has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sounds from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other ends
And livings in windy Providence this is a bits of an annoyances
Also for a while I was having a problems where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a times so that I couldnt hear the person on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
Now for some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Im not really sure if the problems was due to my phone or the EarBooms
Either ways its somethings buyers should be aware of
So I bought this things based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundles over the local retail cost yeah Amazon but thats not why Im writing this reviews
Id like to talk about the performances and comfort of the Earbooms
The eargels thingies are designed quite well of the three different sizes for each ear youres bound to find ones that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt find any that fit my right ears comfortably for extended periods of uses but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side
My wives had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comment on the fit during that activities but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed
Id have to imagine itd take a big hits to knock it loose once in place
Sound quality from the earbud is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity especially the higher frequencies
Normally this is not a problems but it can sometimes make the people youre talking to sound like Isaac Hayes

Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msgs boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phones to my new BMW
I owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
I can be moving 20 mphs on my bicycles talking to someone with no problems
It has far better sounds quality than my backups which is a Jabra with no boom
The ear volume is adjustable on my phones and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont let them adjust the volume
As noted by another reviewer this headset does not come with any buttons or switches the only things on the cord is a shirts clips
6 different ears gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
The headset is very easy to slip into my ear only takes 1 seconds and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sores
My boyfriends reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours its something to keep in mind
However it suits my needs just fine and for the low prices I think its really a great buys
The sounds is great and the sleaks designs and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
The buds actually sits comfortably in my ear this is a first and my neices used the extra bud for her MP3 player and loved them
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it
If you make a lot of cells phones calls this is a very good ear headset

I purchased the pink razrs with Cingular services and couldnt be happier
I have had it for about a months and have had no problems at all
Tmobile is not a very good service in my opinions and that is why I chose Cingular
Sorts of a metallic red with a soft touches rubber feel
Some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but its still red which is nice
I will probably get another color on it for springs
The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different
Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3ms
I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot
Black leather blue piping going around the edges
The blue is that vivid colors that one of those exoticexpensive fish tank fish have neons or tetras Whichever it is it is very sharp looking
It does not add much bulksizeweight to the phone
When I am taking a photos I simply unsnap the halves that is on the flipup half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is take the photo and slips it back on
Before I used to know about this I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the ways like a wayward locks of hairs
Turns out that futzing with the straps is unnecessary
They designed it so you can just remove that halves of the case take photos and snap it back on
In fact the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half
Look what is on the end of that straps before you curse it guys
Its a snaps Snaps unsnaps that is what they are for
It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hands
I can easily pivot it around in my hand flips it around picks it up and basically not expect it to skid around
Without the Glove you have a bare metals or plastic case
Smooth looking and well maybe too smooth for somethings small and costing hundreds of dollars
I think it is at the bottom not at the back the ways some people have said but I can not remember for certain
I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet
The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s
With the glove on I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily
Ive dropped it many times and this case protected it like I wanted
Having room for the extended battery is great too because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phones
Was received in a timely manners however the picture onlines was not what I expected
For the price I really thought it was a little cheap looking in person
As it was a gift I was somewhat disappointed in the qualities
This headseats is pretty neat when youre on the road or just relaxing between work
It easily switches from media players to handsfree headsets when you get a call and also controls the pauseplay and answerhangup features
The comforts of the ear budds could be a little better but the stereos sound is great
The only area of improvement would be the belt clip
I Really like this phones the camera quality the software everythings is excellent
Unfortunately you could not use some of these features in the U
One things I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price
The phones gets 5 stars but the retailers prices gets 2 stars
I will keep this short and to the point this is the best phones I have ever owned
Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear
Replacing my Nokia N90 with this models the photos are much better both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses but this is 3
Also the N73 covers all radio bands making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere supposedly two internal antennae
The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular so depending on the cities I was in I occasionally had very spotty coverage
The Symbian operatings systems in the N73 is faster than the older versions on the N90 and best of all it is much more compact than the N90 fits nicely in the palms of my hand and in my jeans pocket
Last there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the backs of the phone protecting the cameras lense why arents they all like this
As usual the flash isnt the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds
its 12 cents per minutes which is a bits less than half of what most prepaid phones costs
Perfect for my occasional uses and for locating family members when Im in transits and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing
I dont use cell phones much but if I must have one I might as well have one that doesnt make me worry about another huge bill
For kids who think they can mangle the budgets forget it cuz when the card is used up thats it kiddo
Once they use up the cards the only numbers they can dial is 911 but thats it
Bonus features clocks is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day
At some points I might not be able to live without this
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screens protectors are that very thin materials that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screens is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good
This is the states of the arts for screens protectors
And this all becomes an even bigger issues for men because of whiskers over time the screens will get dulled and scratched
Because of the thicknesses and quality of these scratches to the screens are no longer an issue
I was completely satisfied with the phone clips I purchased
I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND
I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN
I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE
I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON
Ive been using this phone with the Net10 service since March and have to say I am very happy with it
I dont use a cell phone very often so this was the most economical way for me to go
Although the phone doesnts have all the bells and whistles like other phones have
Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER
I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare
I got better ringtones onlines and still waiting to see about wallpapers
OverallI would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per weeks
The services has been good and the features are easy to use
The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phones will last
The flip parts is a little weak but we will have to see
It was really easy to add minutes and you can do it right from your Net10 phone
The silicone protective coverings for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thicknesses gains you considerable protections
I have dropped my phones on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the designs of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The functions buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS cars holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection eases of uses and good handlings
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curves bump and buttons on the Treo
My one complaints is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screens
The button layouts is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skins has images on the buttons covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
After buying the new LG Chocolate I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it
I searched the Internet and found this one to be the best value
When I first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phones but as soon as I opened the packages and put my phones in it I could tell it was a perfect fit
I really like the clear windows which I did not have on my previous cases now I can see who is calling and answer my phones without having to take it out of the case every time
Wind noice no problem user friendly coustomer supports for Cardo is great
My only complaints and consequently the 4star ratings is that sometimes I dont hear the Blackberry or feel the vibrations
Apart from that this holsters is a vast improvement over the OEM plastic holster
I have had 2 Zire models and managed to break both screens
My dislike is that I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting
I have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avails
As for the SD cards issue I remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject
To keep from having to take the skins off to reset my treo I drilled a hole in the back right through the battery covers to allow for easy resetting when my treos crashes
The skin is very useful but can be improved on ways to put it on and take it off
Im not really a gadget guys and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up
When the companies gave me a Treo 650 so I can stay in touch I needed to at least take care of the things
Im a minimalists and for that the Treo 650 Skin is perfect A cool looks not bulky
Iam very pleased with this items I purchased it for my son
00 battery and I thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting
I replaced my new batteries with this new battery and now it works like a champs
Just get this battery and you will not have my problems
This items works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
The only problems is that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to fall off
When I bought my Motorola V220 my Cingular Store charged top dollars for the cars chargers and they were sold out
I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon
The cars chargers is compatible with the V220 and it comes with case and handsfree ear bud all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone
The ear buds does not have the best sound voices come across as somewhat muffled though still audible and the case is adequate
I wouldnt buy this sets specifically for those items although they both work withfit the V220
As I see it they were bonuses for purchasing the charger
The product is compact and convenient but it feels flimsy
The hotsync functions stopped working for a bits but was restored after I did a hard resets of my Palm TXso it was not a cable problems but a problems with my TX
For some reason the cables wont let me charge using the USB wallchargers I got for my wifes iPod but it does charge the TX off my computers USB port which is a Powerbook G4notorious for being underpowered
Great receptions great volume controls easy to use
To the reviewers who said too thin well dont get the thin phone then
Works great with his blue teeth and my jabra plug in even comes with the adaptor for plugs in phones
Were in our late 20searly 30s and just dig the phone
One issue DH has the antenna is right near the microphones you speak into bottoms of the phone and when he is on speaker phone he tends to hold it there and it sometimes can make your bars go down
That is it and all you have to do is readjust the ways you hold the phones
its cute its little its perfect for a young women
I had a pocket pcs prior to this and it was so complicated just making a calls
I wanted something simple that wasnt an mp3 players is have an ipods that wasnt a professional cameras is have a nice digital cams or a pda i have a palms txes
although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth but im not sure if its the headset or the phone
almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purses
im grown accustomed to listening for the vibrate features instead
i like how you can put a persons pictures next to their name in your contacts lists
is can wear it in the back pockets of my jeans and its comfortable
I have troubles to buy from Bestbuy but I ordered it from amazon cheapest prices and good products Thanks
The items by itself is perfect to protect the phones from Scratches it fits like a gloves really nice the deliveries from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of uses it wasnt hit or treated carelessly
Ill orders some more because they are really cheap and its better to have a cracked covers than a broken phones
Love how the phones looks in it while it was in good conditions the cases started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it
The only complaints is that the cases open easily if its dropped or handled in a rough ways
Clear tapes on the seams can easily take cares of that
My toddlers has gotten a hold of my phones more than once and dropped it
The case still does not have a chips or crack on it
it covers all of it so you dont need those plastic screen covers
I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and they last about sixtwelve months
I bought this one and it is much more solid of construction shorter cord and a better angles to the power adapters
i bought two of these for less than the cost of one from Sprints
My wife carries hers in her purses while I just keep mine in my cars
This is the best cars charger for the Treo and I have had Treos for about 6 years
i like the catch that holds it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
I have had it for three months now and not a problems so far
The handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it
If you buy this phone it WILL last you a long time
with my phones I know that sounds absurd but its true
Originally I had suggested a friends to upgrade their handsets to getting this one seeing how I had already done so with the Motorola V3T
Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorolas V3T RAZR handsets both for having them freeze at startup I called customer service and told em I wanted this handset instead
With a minor contract extensionhandset upgrades I was glad I made the switches to NOKIA
Ive only had it for 24 hours and Im totally satisfied with it
Below is a list of pros and cons for you to consider
MP3ringtones enabled make sures to cut your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so
Pretty fast charges even while messing around with it
Bluetooth and infraredenabled making for quick files transfers
Date can be enabled on screen which the V3T lacks
Comes with headphone jacks adapters which enables use of any standard headphone that you may have
Vibrate functionality is disabled with handsets charges by defaults
Power button is somewhat small and difficult to execute
FM radios plays with static this may varies by areas
As you can see the pros outweight the cons with this one so give it at try
Also if you decide that its not for you return it to TMobile within 14 business days of your purchases and get a full refund
As for me I wont returning it because its definitely a keepers
I purchased this phone to replace my lands lines and have not been disappointed
I havent used all the functions yet downloading music but havents had any problems with anythings else
2Good Volumes ringer volumes is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine
1No shortcuts to get to main menu have to keep pressing back button
2Battery access its really hard to take the casing off to get to the batteries and SIM cardcould be a good things though
3OnOff Button its very smallbasically have to use my fingernails
I got a chance to play with one of these last weeks
The external speakers is very loud the controls are easy to use and best of all it comes with a 1GB card
My only gripes is the slide feels a little loose I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake
All in all a killer phones and the MP3 capabilitysoftware is a lot better than my KRZR
I purchased this Nokia 5300 Black at the TMobile store
It does come with 1 GB memory cards and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last nights with no problems
Phones comes with USB cables to connect to your computers
You will not be able to download songs bought from iTunes but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4s
I wasnt able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBooks but I was able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car
Apple has not approved the Nokia 5300 yet to sync
I am sure it is a matter of times since the phone is rather new
Overall I love the feel of this phone has wonderful 2 in screen colors is great camera is cool and it is very intuitive to use
I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia
However the speakerphones is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned
Once you load up your songs the speakers is impressive
This morning I had the phones playing musics in one part of the houses and I had to go get somethings at the other ends of the house and I could still hear the music perfectly
I was talking to my friends during busy traffics and lots of peoplebackgrounds noises and I was able to carry on a pleasant conversations with her unlike my Samsungs that was difficult to do this with
And I am happy to have a phones that not everyones has a Motorola Razor
This Nokia 5300 looks a bits chucky compared to that phones but I feel like I have a very unique phone that is more than a phones
Who needs an iPod mini when you can get this and your phones all in one
I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phones
There is very little to chose from at the TMobile store as far as accessories and Nokia
You can choose to wake up to your favorite songs that you have downloaded and you can programs it to slowly increase the volume of the songs for your alarm
You can make calls without even having to slide the phone to dial
As long as you have the numbers you want already stored in your phones book then all you have to do is look up and press the green button
When you are playing your music if an incomings call comes in it will stop playing the songs and then alert you with the normal ring tones that a call is coming in
Once you are done with the phone call you can resume playing your musics
As I said this phone is a gems in all areas speaker sturdy colorful I think it is contemporary and an acquired tastes for sure but nonetheless appealing call qualities is great even in loud areas and lots of little creatures comforts
Definitely consider this phones if you really like to have music and blueteeth and speakerphone
I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most parts
The first things youll notice is how crisp and clear the screens is
This is a sliders phones and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the numbers keys
The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the key is to dial a new numbers thats not in your contacts and to text messages
3MP cameras camcorder musics player 1GB microSD card bluetooth support and infrared port
Now the FM radio isnt satellite based so you can not pick up radio stations from across the U
Now I will go into the good and bad things about each features
3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras but can you show me a cameras that does what this phones does 55
While you are recording the quality seems perfect
However once you play it it turns a bit distorted
Plus it only allows for 20 seconds of recording times regardless of the size of your microSD cards
However I still could not find a ways to change the order of the songs without making a playlist
Theres play pause next songs previous song fast forward and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures
The buttons must be pressed fairly hard so your music wont starts playing spontaneously in your pockets
Also I was blown away on how the quality of the musics improves once you put on those stock earbuds
FM Radio I bet those that have this phones tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancements
Well the truths is you dont need to buy anything extra
Just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone and this will serve as an antenna and will allow you to hear stations
And since you need the earbudss to hear the radios yes the sound will go to the earbudss
However theres a loudspeakers options that allows the radio to be played through the external speakers but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in as it serves as the antenna
This means that if you want to hear the radios on your phones you NEED to have the earbuds with you
You may need to play around with the position of the phones and antennae or you may have to move in order to get clear reception
You cant delete the precreated profiles those that come with the phones
In orders to change the phone to vibrate you must make a vibratings profile
Then to use it it takes several steps which is not hard but inconvenient
The interface shows the months and dates but not the days of the weeks
Its much faster than the old one I used for an earlier Ericsson CF388
Good products the retractable chord features is great and keeps the car clutters free
This one is great the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and uses
It looks pretty fragile but so far its held up to pretty heavy use
Many of the other chargers Ive owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connections no such problems with this ones
Easy to snap on and it wont come off easy like others
This is the one you want if you dont like the bulky one
It slides around too much it needs a smaller fits it is too big
I have a babies pinks Razr and this skin looks so good over it
Also it really adds grips so its not as easy to drop and the silicone stays warm in cold weathers unlike the bares metals of the razr
I would reccomend a silicone skins cases for anyone with a razr they are awesome
This covers is great it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the traumata to the phones if dropped
It isnt soft leather so if you want to protect your RAZR you might want to consider a shields
I think it will do a good job of protecting my phones in case I drop it
Hard shells protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable
protections on hinges is not there but overall protections is the best for any cover Ive seen for this phones
keeps keys and screen open so no dust gets pushed up against them
5mm jacks and still insist buying this after looks at the images then what the h
this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky
thinking about buying a couples more in different color
I am very happy with the phone case there are alot of cases available this is by far the best in my opinions
Wow I have absolutely no problems with this headsets whatsoevers
Clear soundgreat rangeand most of all its gorgeous
Only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly
It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it
It is easy to operate and the charges last for many days
I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size
Crystal clear sounds along with being very comfortable and user friendly make this headset a great cell phones accessory to have Love it Amazons price couldnts be beat
fully compatible with Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR
not the best sound qualities I like Logitech betters
The sounds quality in both units are great but Im impressed by the weight of this LG units
It is like comparing stones to feathers a bits exagerated but you get the point
This LG units also has a protruding ear bud which sits snuggly in my ear
which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree rights before it falls
That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my head a bits to keep the units against my ear
With the new LG I no longer have to look like I have a stiff neck while Im driving
This items came with the other items I ordered at the same time
Its qualities is good but does not stay on the phones when opened as well as I would have liked
The title says it all Fits Great Great Price Real leather and fits like a gloves
This products is a good deal if you know how to use it
Unfortunately if you are purchasing this products to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider
The Verizon Vcast product would be better because it comes with Headphones
If you already have the headphones which cost anywhere from 20100 than this product will be good for you
It fits great but doesnt covers the corners of the phone
The seams at the tops of the ear pieces is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful
The bolts on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip youres stuck with it sticking out in your pocket
I am using this as a spares so havent actually put it in the phone yet
i bought this for my tungstens e2s since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync an idiots design if you ask me and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires
and to buy a cradles which used to come with the palms was an extra 3040 so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing
the reasons why it got only 4 stars is bc when i first tried it my computers said that it didnt recognize the usb devices
is searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why
it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2s more
so the connectors part could be a little sturdier thats all
Use it every days its a nice connector that does just what it says it does
As with all TreoPalm connectors you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection
Wiggling the connectors where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to work for me
Its not listed in the products descriptions but you can find the info on ziplinqss webs site
The product works very well but might prove a little flimsies if one is not careful connecting the phones
Overall I would recommend it if the user pays attentions when connecting
Eventually prices will be free like the motorola Razor V3
Receptions is crystal clear and it is also a mp3s player with the ablilities to add a memories cards
Video and voices recording capabilities and a 8x zoom cameras
I was expecting just to save the touchscreens from scratches but these screens make the touchscreens also feel better
Placing the screen was a bits tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough
Have been using just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all Ill need to replace it
The only problem might be that it is hard to pull it out of the holsters without flipping it open and thus answering the phones
It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did
For a holsters i give it 4 stars because its functions is to hold the cell phones in places on your belt
One problem is have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the straps should be so having a strap on it wouldnt works too well
and also because it holds it where the straps is it adds a little wears to that area
I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall which was highly over priced for my standards
Amazon seems like a great place to buy it but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories then you can find a sites with free shippings for it and its 7 bucks
Theres also another sites that has it for 3 bucks but with shipping
So if you want a functional holsters get this one
I have had this phone and Virgin Mobile pay as you go service for only a days or two but I wanted to write this review before I forget
Once you get over the industrial strength plastics clamshell monster it comes in its a good ride
Turn it on and things get a bit zanies with the animations on the colors screens but its a pleasant experiences
The sounds qualities is good on both ends of the conversations
It seems a real nobrainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service
You can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuffbut youll have to get used to the funny graphics
You interact with the menu on the screens and the few keys below it as if youve been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences
One things this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine thirties
While its a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing pay as you gofor me 18cmin theres a tons of stuffs to play with if your trains gets stuck in a tunnels
I have Lily Tomlins operator character answering my voicemails and found a wallpapers with my first names spelled out in diamonds and if I should ever receive a text messages among my canned response options that come standards with the phones are Hell no Cant talks and Leave me alone
My friend has had one for a few months and loves his
He makes a good bits more money than I and sports some fancy handheld devices so its not just that its so cheap and cool
Im a longrunning Virgin customer but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industries and so Ive had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carriers including nonUS
Previous Virgin phones Ive used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255
My 8610 still works but its a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade
This is probably the cheapest phones of its sizecapabilities available anywhere
It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet I sometimes forget its there
For the cost it is pretty decent in terms of features
128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support 10 MB for downloads 32 total speakerphones web capabilities comparable performances to most Nokia series 40 devices
For those that have had troubles with the batteries I suggest you try turning off the backlight
Ive found this to be very reliable in my area and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors
Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell which was also good my old Kyocera on the other hands was garbage
The phones graphics are a bits odd but not necessarily in a bad ways
Good libraries of games ringtones and graphics available
Now I actually have somethings to spend all that balance on
Its no good if you want video on demand 3G or whatnot
But for just making callstexting now and then you simply cant beats 203 months
No annual contract as well which is a huge plus as many whoves had one knows all too well
They are a bit stiff as well which is good and bad good because you wont accidentally press them as easily bad because typing is more of a pain
Their web service costs extra and it has problems viewing many page formats says networks gremlins when you try
You can browse basic html and thats about it good luck reading emails with it
No blueteeth builtin though this is to be expected
This can actually be a good thing since camera phones are offlimits in more areas than you might expect
There are flaws with it as with any phone but the pluses outweigh the minuses
Ive seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phones but in my professional opinions and it is an expert opinion these people need to realize that you get what you pay for
This isnt a 200 Samsung T519 and youre not paying 60 a months for services on a 2 year contracts
Considering the costs the Slice is an great handsets with excellent services and that is that
Ive been a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewerif you want a phonephones without all the extra hooplas this isnt a bad deals
I bought a red Slice a couple of weeks ago take note that Im not one of those people with a cells phones perpetually growing out of one ear and for my needs emergencies quick calls to family from the grocery stores its just right
I got mine for free with Reward Zone points at Best Buy
Nice looking someone mistook it for a Chocolate the other day
Clear reception long distances calls are just as crystal as local not sure if this is an areas things but apparently the service in and around Chicagos solid
Payasyougo options works well for someones who doesnt spend a lots of times on the phones
My Slice holds a charge just fine Ive noticed other reviewers have said this is a problems but so far so good and doesnts heat up as someone else mentioned maybe that reviewers got a defective phones or battery
Its so slim my husband has bet me Ill lose the phones within a couples of months could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desks
Someone else mentioned the odd graphics hot dogs dripping blue sauce some sorts of pipes looking cartoons with teeth
Seriously I have no ideas what those things might be but I say its workable if you have a senses of humors
I have small hands slender fingers and I still manage to bump the 3 whenever Im trying to shut off the phone
Sometimes its difficult to turn on the button doesnt always respond when I push it though could be Im a wimp but once its on its fine
Im thinking this will get broken in with more uses
I find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty phone confessions
And since I havent forked out hundreds of dollarsors any dollars reallyI wont feel too guilty whenif I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperworks
I got my Slicer past black Friday for 19 from Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency
The Virgin plan 18 cmin pays as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phones for what they were originally made to do
First 20 phone cards lasted me little bits over 2 months one has to recharge accounts once every three months to keep the account active despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30cmin to Eastern Europe
I used the phone on my business trip to call home
The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phones so far
They also have planties of ring tones and graphic options
for downloading mostly priced about 2 per download
The phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuffs except a camera
However the memories is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for 19
I am surprised to hear that other people complained about the battery lives
The only bad things I discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone for example during the flight I had to reconnect phones to charger in orders to activate it again
I would sincerely recommend the phone and the Virgin pays as you go plan to mature users
1 When a headset is attached the phones does not ring through the external speakers
So if you are not wearing the headsets when a call comes in
2 There is no option to use vibrates and rings at the same time
In Standby the phone runs out of power after about six hours
To reply to a text you have to start a new message and then search for the sender of the original message
5 The rings tones that come with the phone are horrible
Aside from those few problems I have been quite satisfied with the phone
I got this phones to use as a phone and am very happy with it
I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review
I have a nice canons camera and dont want to use my phones to take pictures
I dont want to use my phones to listen to music or surf the internet either I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a texts here and there
If you are one of those people that has a different agenda for your phone then this is probably not the phone for you
This phones is comparable to a Hershey bar in thicknesses and widths but shorter
It fits in my pants or shirts pockets without feeling bulkies
It makes a razr feels thicks but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvr
The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phones
Sprints network is not the best in my area but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connections even with 1 bar
When I was in the car the roads noises got too loud to hear but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine and keep my hands on the wheels
Virgins is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lots
I expect to spend between 150 and 200 this first years including the 50 up front for the phone
The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same periods with local taxes and fees included
Although I havent tried them it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level
Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it it also looks like a real piece of equipment
As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phones on the conference tables in a meeting with the VP
in vibrate mode of courses At the same time my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phones so he can have this one because it is so cool
The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu
What were they smoking when they decided to use a pigs for my account a dragons for messaging etc
Other than that the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive
Cant really comment on reliability on this phones after just two weeks but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine
Perhaps because they are affordable in other ways Virgin screws you on ringtones and backgrounds
The four ringtones included are unacceptable and you are blocked from up or down loading your own
They do have a pretty big collection on their websites you can get for 2
The included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too so you are likely to fork out 2
00 for a wallpaper from their webs sites for that as well
Most of the times I do fine but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small
Of courses once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I havent runs into that problem any more
Battery lives has not lived up to what I read but that might be because of how I use it
I ordered an extra chargers to keep in the offices and one for the car as well just in case
After two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someones looking for a phone to use for making phone calls
It is not big on extras like a cameras but what it does it does well
Virgin uses Sprints network see if you can find out about their networks in your area before you buy a Virgin phone
I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now
Ive used it for 3 years and really like its basic functionalities
The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and thats pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have lowbattery life
Im hoping itlls last for 2 more years before I get a new phones to catch up with the modern world
Saves times and updownloading pics tunes tofrom my phone
The Speck rubbers cases is the best case ive found for my Blackberry 7290
That being said its not ideal and id make a few changes
Pros protects case well no screen scratches minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag no need to use the belt clips most women prefer pursestotebags to belt clips and i love the facts that you can easily see whether you have new messages no needs to take it out of the cases in additions to taking it out of your purses or totebag
Cons clear cases collects dirts screens cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlights screen covers doesnts fit squarely into the rubber cases and screens cover gets scratches on it making the screens harders to read
I get a lot of compliments on this case its different enough to be noticed and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case
However because of the cons I suspect ill need to replace this cases more than once a year
But i like it enough that ill pay the 35 to do so
Maybe the next versions will have some improvements
In the meantime i feel like im getting my moneys worth out of it
Im not really a gadgets guy and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up
When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can stay in touches I needed to at least take cares of the thing
Im a minimalist and for that the Blackberry Skin is perfect A cool look not bulky
THIS COVER IS SO HOT I GET TONS OF COMPLEMENTS ON IT ITS A GREAT COLOR AND THE SCREEN PROTECTOR HELPS A LOT TOO
It attaches easily and I especially like the screen covers most cases dont have this if you drop the phones and crack the screen youre hosed
The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belts clip
I have had this for 2 months now and it has worked out well
I use it on my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercise I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone
When a calls comes the AudiblePlayer pauses and I can answer the phones with the builtins button
Voice quality is fine on my ends in both ears and I have received no complaints from the other ends unlike the other reviewers maybe he got a bad units or his stereo connector is dirty
I never have to stop my exercises or even slow down My only complaint is that the volume control doesnts work worth beans
When you rotate it at various positions you will hear from one ear or the other
There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears but that is not at the maximum volumes
This is a bits annoying but something I can live with
I just leave it at one position close to the maxes volumes but a little less and use the volumes controls on my cells phone to adjust volume
It is so flexible and high quality soundvolume control
Just plugs in a headsets of your choice and you can
It will automatically shut off the music when the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the calls with your headset still ON
Works with any headset and you can hear it in BOTH ears by the ways
I keep my headphones on while on treo cells phones calls because it has a BUILT in Mic which is perfect
I have a stressful jobs and listening to musics while I am working in my homes offices with headsets and the ability to pick up calls and leave my headsets on with microphone is REALLY GREAT
In Dec 06 it went through the washings machines in my pants I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what IT WORKS
I am still using it as it works perfectly even the cameras
I used my sisters Razr phone this weekends and I hated it
The redial features was slow and the phone not comfortable
I will be keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives
This Samsung is the most reliable phones Ive ever had
Ive had it for two years dropped it NUMEROUS times and it is still going strong with only a few scratches
The battery lives has declined during this period of time but it still lasts about two days before charging
While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now I am impressed with how many applications I use daily alarms clock schedulers memoes pads etc
In all honesty though the camera is not terribly great
Pictures tend to have a weird color tints when you transfer them to your computers and are often blurry
I still enjoy the camera if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options black and white brightness flashes etc
The videos option is rather lame though as the footage is choppy and you cant even transfer or send it to anythings
Recently when I was on a shuttle two girls both with Razors saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well
Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones
I am supposed to be getting a new phones too but I know I will be keeping this one as a backs up
If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phones this is a good one
Almost 2 years ago my fiance and I signed up for a 2year contract with Verizon
And two years later both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents
This is a great phones for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily
I have 38 pictures saved on my phones right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone
Sturdy Its not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultrathin phones
I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent conditions
Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phones the batteries doesnt detach easily
Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson the battery would also detach and Id have to restart my phones
Compact Though it is on the thicker side this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it
Good Buttons For those who text messages a lot the way the buttons feel can really make a difference
The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting
Menu short cuts On the side of the phones you can adjust your ringtones volumes by simply pressing the up or down arrow
If press the camera buttons on the right hand sides of the phone the cameras videos menu pop up
You can also choose which shortcuts youd like when you press up I have mine set on the calendar
Long battery lives Im not one to spend hours on my cell phone but for every days use this phone is great with respect to its batteries life
There have been times when I forget to charge my phones and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged
Cameras has flash other neats options You can also adjust the brightness levels have a self timer take multiple shots 10 different fun frames and 5 different colortones like sepia monochrome black white and negative
Phonebook Contacts are easy to accesses and its easy to search for entries
I like the facts that you can enter multiple numbers under one name
You can enter that persons home mobile faxes offices and pager numbers
You can assign a personalized ring tone and pictures and you can categorize your contacts in different groups
Voice commandsBy pressing holding the buttons a voice command menus appears
Its a nice feature but is not something I often use
Speed dailing One features that I do take advantages of is speed dailing
Its nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another people
Menu styles There are 2 different menus styles you can use
I like the nature options which has cutes animations for each subcategories you scroll through
My fiances uses the icon style which is a more simple design
Despite the generous 15 ring tones its hard finding a ringtones that doesnt make you want to pull your hair out
Out of the 15 rings tones there are only about 2 decent ring tones
Antenna I dont use the antenna very often but when I do it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy
If you intend on taking a lots of pictures I would recommend investing in a better pictures phones
Overall This cells phones is exactly that a cells phone to make calls
It has some additional features like pictures takings and video and organization tools like the phonebooks and planner but it is still a fairly basic phones
It was my first phones ever and when it came times to get a new one i just couldnt find a phones as great as this ones
So if your looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anything cause let me tell you mine went through worlds war 3 and its still working like new and not to mention the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in time if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect is was and still am real pleased with this phones and it is an excellent phones for anyones
If youre hard on your electronics like I am this phones is for you
I put mine through the washing cycle as in washing machine yes three times let it dry overnight and it still works perfectly
Ive also run it through the dryers twice dropped it countless times thrown it at a walls and rans over it on a mountains bikes
The cameras still works and I think the reception actually got BETTER after going through the washers
All it has is some scratches on the casings and a bent antenna
This is a perfect phone for a onthego klutzy people
The camera is pretty good and its small and cute in size and it has good receptions
This Similar Unit is 14th the Costs of the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300 and it is JUST AS GOOD
Bottom line it is just a Pieces of Plastic that gets the Job don
Ive had my snapons cases for about a month and I love it
The magenta color looks very much like the original pink razrs phone
The bottom cases could fit a little more snugly but its not a problems
Fits great My Wife likes the bright colors as it is easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone
The color and fits were great I was worried since it was a phone from Altell but it fit like a glove Thanks
You dont have to get a car charger but its a good ideas if you have a car
It fits well and even though it is made of plastics it has a textured leather feels to it
I found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fits
But sometimes it can slip and press the buttons on the sides of your phones
It can either make the phones not works or run down the batteries
First of all fast shipping and second of all what a great products it is I absolutely love it and so does everyones who sees it Thanks
I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover
I have actually dropped my phones and this has protected it
Only one complaint the clips is not tight enough on my belts would recommend a little tighter
This cases is well equiped the handles wearing it on belt at worls plays movies etc
easily access good looking It functions at any level
The cases fits like a glove Appears high qualities with the rich leathers looks and feels and detailed stitching
The covers and back were easy to attach and did not scratch my phones which I checked by removing the case
My only complaints was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt
No problem if you slide off the back covers and take off the small foam pieces on the insides you will see a tiny screw
There will be a holes in your cover if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece
Attach the back covers to the phone and then fill in the holes with a piece of felts
If you are a clip user the clip is clear plastics and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it
But maybe that is a good thing so that it wont fall off accidentally
I can not comment on how well the cases will wear since I have only had a few days
I chose the navy blue cases and am truly amazed at how well the cases fits the phones
This was a great prices for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard batteries
The only things I dont like is the lacks of a rubbers strips on the back of the battery doors to keep the phones from sliding around
Id give it 5 stars if not for the cheezies covers it falls off sometimes
I like the shape of the plug so that it doesnt cover up any other outlets
If anyones needs one for twentyfive plus shippings that has not been registered with Net10 still has bonus 300 minutes and no numbers is new and has all original accessories open packages or for ten extra you can get an OEM cars chargers leathers cases and earphones all unused pleases emails movieshopathotmaildotcoms
Ive had TracFone service for 2 days now and glad I switched
The C139 is small compact and fits in my shirt pockets
It lacks in ring tones and the addresses book could be better but for a simple phones its all I need
I dont need the internet accesses and all the other features I end paying for and not using
TracFones was quick to transfer my phone number which happened in 1 days and they said it would take 7 days
I wont go back to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in on a service agreements for 2 years
I have good services and will be saving 300 a years now
If you want a nice small lights and simple phone that all you want to do is make and receive phone calls this is the one
For the 50 bucks you pay here you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime
Thats not a bad deal considering if you bought the phones itself elsewhere it would be 20 bucks and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately 20 some odd bucks or so
Frankly I see no savings to buying this phones on this site versus elsewhere
Regarding the sim cards I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertions
A sim cards is a delicate silicons apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD electro static discharges just like computers RAM is
ESD is probably the primary reasons why so many reviewers phones here have failed
Id bets every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weathers is cold and snows
Before you handle the sim card you should ground yourself by touching somethings metals
Otherwise you run the risks of destroying the sim card with ESD
I just transferred my mobiles from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139s about the only edge the c139s has over the V120c is the color displays
Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interfaces as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper
IMO Motorola could have added a ports to accomodate a USB interfaces to this model
It was shortsighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c also in the same price ranges has such a port
Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this times
I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday 102806 and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phones
In Southern California the network this models TracFone uses is Cingular
Suffice it to say I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned messages that it doesnt recognize my number and to input my voicemail numbers
I anticipate nothings but problems with technical support when I contact them
They are very polite as customers services reps however they can barely speak or understand English
I am envisioning hours of BS with the calls I have to make because past experiences has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOevers
Notes to Tracfone Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT
Also I wasnt overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging
But the c139s does have one advantage in this regard text messages cost only 0
3 units versus on the V120c TracFone was deducting 0
5 units for each incoming and outgoing text messages
Im not sure why that is considering the deductions of units has zip to do with the model of the phones
It should be one uniform deductions across the board
Consumers should contact TracFone customer service and inquire about this phenomena
Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyones who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phones and wants an inexpensive phones with a much easier on the eyes color displays
Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for 20 bucks
But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper and a little more flexibility then get yourself a Nokia 2126
For the same money you spend here the Nokia is a better phone
It has a USB port a speakerphone plus other extras
And you probably wont have any trouble setting up the voicemail either
i like that it has free call waiting and free caller ids
if you havent activated your tracfones yet then the refer a friend programs will give each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an emails and is will send you a fast referral
Customer service is fine and the free voicemails was easy to set up and use
If you decide to get a tracfone pleases email me for a quick referrals before activating it we each will get 100 free minutes from the refer a friend program
Ill also send you the simple instructions to follow
Ive used Tracfone for quite a while so i should be able to answer any questions you might have
ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks is should be able to get us the free minutes
i like that it has free calls waiting and free callers ids
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer a friend programs will give each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an emails and is will send you a fast referral
I have had this phones for about 6 months now and all together is has been great
I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good
I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces
This phones is dont have that problem it is really made good
i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine
Are we all talking about the same phone here I havent had any problems with it and using it is a breazes
I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plans so I wouldnt get stuck with roaming charges while I was away far from my calling areas
My old phone also an LG wasnts compatibles with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old ATT services
I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one things that I was looking for
It does not have a camera and I was not looking for one
I already own three very good stands alone cameras why bothers with another I was although a little aggravated having to reenter all of my old phones book information because thats the only ways you can do it
The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic
After two nobrands aftermarket cables which were invisible to the phone and Nokia Phone Suite this cable and the included software drivers worked perfectly
Note Nokia Phone Suite must be separately downloaded but is free of charge
We have uploaded photographs from our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computers keyboards to the phone
Nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cable
I recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone
Some Motorola phones accept a universal miniUSBs cables which I believe is cheaper
Although I have not used the headset yet the cases and charger work perfectly
Be careful Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz
Read the Vital Statistics section in the full writes up and you will see no mentions of 850MHz
Check the Sony web pages and other people who sell this phone and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz
I dont own this phone but was researching it for a friends when I discovered this discrepancies
I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case I have no ideas if this phone is really good or not
Purchased this phones a little over a month ago and so far everythings works well and have no problems
Many nice features and the service in the states of GA is good
I bought this phone as part of the SprintNextel SERO plans
I used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didnt fit my needs for several reasons outlined below
Battery lives was sporadic I got maybe a day worth of power from it
For the price of the phone and the two years contract it carries this is a dealbreakers
The Nextel networks coverage has gone downhill in my area I was a former Nextel subscribers for 3 years so I have some experience with coverage around town
I was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals
An incoming calls would light up the displays but there would be no ringing
This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibrates and then turned it back to ring
For the same monthly service fee I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet abilities
Admittedly the high speeds access is not as useful on a tiny screen but if Im going to be locked into a 2 years contracts I would like to have some fast internet accesses on the phone
If I were then my opinions of this phones might be a little higher since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkies talkie networks
I could not justify being locked into a 2 years contract with equipment that seemed subpars on a network that did not and likely never will support the latest high speed technologies
Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phones
Thankfully Motorola designed the phones so the microSD cards is accessible from the outside no needs to pull the battery to update the cards
You CAN NOT use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the microsd cards as ringtones
You also can not readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download
Any message mms that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper
Battery lives on my phones is flaky Im getting maybe a day and onehalf with usages that approximates 60 minutes talk times and perhaps 6 to 10 pictures messages
There are some users who have modified the phones and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their microSD memories cards however the processes is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with
Notes Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same companies
Nextel there are only a couples reasons that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint
Second if you have a needs to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature
The Sprint side of the companies features phones with significantly enhanced web browsings and higher speeds data communications
The Nextel sides clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrialconstruction markets
For almost every consumers the Sprint side is a better deal
Sprint in my experience has better customers service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customers service representatives
Heres my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks
Nextel smsmms messages can now be autodownloaded I believe this is the first Nextel phones to sport this features
cant play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other nonNextels transfers Note Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjals to make transfers with a cable but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle
Nextel is in my opinions on their way out as a carriers soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things
While not entirely unexpected it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to nonconstruction users Nextels core group
If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versuss most Sprint plans which include them
Nextel doesnts have the super fasts data speeds or network web browsings of competing carriers
Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character based waps sites that both crawl along speedwises and present unexciting character based screens
the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to
while not phones related some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactities with a lots of busy signals
I am only getting about a day of batteries lives which is extremely low
I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboards first
how brilliant They shouldve provided some sorts of User Guide on how to put the case on
The sellers is awesome very Amazonlike shippings i
The leather is nice and what you cant see from the picture is that the items is held into the cases by a plastics covering over the keyboard
When closing the keyboards the plastics does catch a little but I think that will go away the more I use it
The phone fits snugly into the case and no parts of the screen is covered by the leather exterior
Each exterior buttons is given its own holes in the leather
The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leathers designating ok and ptts
The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick accesses to the touchscreens
On the flopsides of the faceplates is a convenient meshes pouch for memories cards or etc
Another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clips however there is no places to secure the belts clip onto the case
I was very happy to see that Amazon shipped me PalmOne brand Styluss and not some generic
This is a great deals and Im going to order some more
The hell with Palm that changes stylus with every new model
Great battery now the phones goes way longer without needing to be recharged
I ordered this headset in silver Webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really IS silver We argued about the color and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white silver red and black
It took almost a month to get resolved but I finally have the silver headsets that I ordered
There are 3 different sizes earpieces for a better fits
The headset gets 4 stars Webtreo only gets 1 star
This is by far the best blueteeth headsets in the markets it is small and very light as well just like wearing an earing
The sound is amazingly clear people on the other end thought I was actually using my phone
I have no problems with it falling off just make sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ears
Im so happy with this cutie that Im buying it for my sisters friends
Consumers Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as the best
I can hear my callers while driving and they can hear me
The Samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headsets so you wont look like a cheesies phones operators while driving in your cars
And if you want to be one of those people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places its small enough where people will really wonder if youre a crazy people talking to yourself
Gim me a break The Samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger
This is super handy since the headset is so small and would be easy to lose or damage if not for the sturdies but not at all bulky carrying case
The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headsets that I did not quickly return due to poor headsets volume
I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my cars
I simply could not hear the people to whom I was talking
The Samsung is the first to provide enough volume
Im still happy with it after two months of ownership
The Samsung was also approximately 35 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy or other retailers whether online or in people
The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars and not five is because of the short talks time and because it does not stay in your ears while running
I learned this one morning when I was late for work and rans from my car to my office
If the Samsungs short talk time is not a concerns for you then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performances in such an extremely small package
The button on the headsets string lets you automatically place a call and end the calls
Works much better and more reliably than ANY BlueTooth set Ive tried and Ive tried almost all of them
only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easil
This cases has good qualities construction and fits properly
It solves the problems of being able to plug in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the cases
I prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this cases uses
I also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working
The fixed belts clip design only allows vertical positioning
This is still the best optional cases if you want to use the MP3 player features and require the uses of earphones
I recently took a chance on this items and I am happy to report that its not bad
I was actually not looking forward to a swivel bad experience but the swivels is very solid
The only problem I have with it is that you have to take out the phone completely in orders to use it
My only complaint is that the cords is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the prices
The short cord is the only reasons it didnt get a 5 star rating
you can tell that the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store
but it does the job well and i have never had a problems with it
I have nothing but good things to say about this purchases and products
I only wish they could make a PDA phones that wasnt as big as a boats
However the silvers door that comes with the extended batteries falls off easily
The holster that Samsung supplies with their phones will not allow you to flip open the phone when phones is in the holster
How stupid is that Why would Samsung supply this types of holster to their customers
You can now flip open your phones when using this holster
I wasnt expecting a lots from this extremely inexpensive case but Im very impressed
I bought from accessories one the total cost was about 4
The case fits nearly perfectly every holes is the right sizes and in the right places not as exact as possible but everythings works just as well as without the case
Others have complained of chipping paint but in the weeks Ive been using this it hasnt chipped yet
If I remove the belt clips there is still an impediment where it use to be
For the quality and fits of this cover the price is a bargain
It fits very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grip
I found the razrs v3 to be akward or slipperies at times and this covers takes cares of that problems
If youre looking for a slim covers that wont add a lots of bulk to your RAZR this one is great
No it probably WONT provide much protections if you drop your phone
It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints and the rubberized materials is easy to grip and feels great in your hand
The cutouts for the outside displays camera I have a V3m and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well
I dont use the belt clip as the covers by itself adds hardly any bulks so I just keep my phones in my pockets
Without the belts clips there is a small snap that sticks out a bits from the backs of the cover but its really no big deals
Thought Id posts this info here since this subject still confuses people
I just talked to a custs care representative who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180day period will invalidate 250 Amazon phones rebates
Well I guess that is a major turns down for me for this phone and this offer since I dont really need a datas plans and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the times
I still would like to give it 5 stars since I believe it is a great product
Ill take one star off however due for its weak battery lives and lacks of standard audio connection 2
There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate
My intent is to document some of the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hopes that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future
I am a business user who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device
I use a Motorola H700 headsets with my old devices and the 8525
My overall assessments is Replacing my two 3 years old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I dont think are necessary in terms of functionalities and eases of use
All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flips phone
If readers find that there is a ways to perform any of the deficiencies I describe please let me know
Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting
To hear my voice commands repeated I have to turn on the annoying sounds of the PDA so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset I can hear my voice commands repeated back
I am referring to the standard voices dial that comes with the 8525
One quick solution would be to tie BT headsets to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA
Even nicer would be an upgrades that allows full audio with the VoiceCommand software this is documented in many other reviews
Another nice features of my Motorola cells phones was as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume changed from vibrates to audio if it was set to vibrate
It changed back to the original audios setting after turning off the BT headset
1a If I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screens should ALWAYS display the voices dial page
Instead the initial Owner Info pages stays up and you cant see the names on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screens
If you didnt set the PDA to its annoying noise levels you cant hear the name you requested either
2 Need to be able to control the PDA and phone volumes independently for Audio Vibrate or OFF
For examples need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volumes setting on OFF or vibrate
3 Needs to be able to programs how long the display stays on
I am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off when I need to see somethings
4 I would buy a non Bluetooth headsets if one was available for long drives when my BT headset batteries is dead
Only solutions I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeways
5 Provide a built in ways to make the PTT and Comm Manager and IE Quick key buttons programmable
I would use them for many other functions such as PTT bringing up the volumes control so I can change it from vibrates to audio to speaker needs to be able to select speakers here see below
6 Give me a ways to press an external button to toggle between speaker on and off
I cant easily push the speaker icons with my fingers
Add a radios button on the volumes controls that allows you to select speakers phone
Yes you can select the phone speakers soft button but often the display has gone blank and the keypads is showing
7 Provide options to save email attachments to storage card
That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memories
8 Remember the Filter settings I selected for Tasks
If I have filtered by a task category during that session remember the filter I selected
Currently I have so many tasks there is a 5 second delays to bring them all up
9 Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key or make this button programmable I am always having to close the browser because it gets hitselected
10 Let me EditPaste with one steps for notes words tasks notes etc
With 8525 OS you must select Menu then Edit then Copy
Question is there a key on the keypads to select CNTRL C for copies like what is done on a PCs the letters are underlined in the menus but I dont see a CNTRL keys on the keypad
11 Allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the tops and then use the nav buttons to move across the icons might be the ways to allow an external way to set audio volume
12 If I power off the device have it remember my input selection
I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do
However eventually i found out that the phone part of this pdas is not as great as my previous cameras phone
My friends complain that they hear a lots of outside noises while talking
The phone earvolumes is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places
Software The windows applications Word Excel Media players
Plus Ability to create office documents and play games
Hardware Micro sds slot Sandisk card costs me 20 bucks
Wireless Internet You could connect this devices to any wireless unsecure networks to get to the internet
I dont have a datas plans with Cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my WIFI homes networks
If iam at a coffee shop is could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free
The views finders is sloppy and can not capture images in low light
Battery needs to be charged every second day depends on usages but even with light uses is had to charge it every other days
To listen to musics need to purchase microsd card
Leather cases by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device
The only problem is that after you put this case on the phones volume needs to be set to the max even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well
But the boxwaver case could be opened half ways and folded over
If you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phones this is for you
Build qualities is typical of HTC meaning very good
The call quality is good provided youre in a decent service areas systems not overloaded with AMRHR kicking in
The scroll wheels is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed uses much more manageable
The slides out keyboards is easy to use and provides very good tactiles feedback
There is a huge users community and a very large knowledge bases to consult this is perhaps the ultimate geek phones
The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivities tools
There is a learning curves involved with Windows Mobile but IMHO its not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be
In general things work as they are supposed to with this phones
One drawbacks is that while the devices does support the Bluetooth A2DP profiles stereos bluetooth sound the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this devices is horrible
The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono which means youll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth
The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low qualities which also involves a series of registries tweaks to improve
And even after all of that there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audios
In other words dont waste your monies on a sets of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audios seriously
However the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular monoones ears BT headsets I recommend the Jawbone and the call and voices qualities experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable
Another audio related drawback of this device There is not even a 2
The only physical audios out is through HTCs proprietary jack which is also the powers and data jacks
The saving graces here is that the earbuds the units ships with are actually passable and also the availabilities of HTCto3
Even with a few shortcomings I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized markets
It packs an incredible amounts of power into a remarkably usable forms factor
If youre in needs of a Windows Mobile devices and a fan of the slides out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices this is your phone
Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skools Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed
I have been a PocketPC Phone users for several years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professionalbyday GadgetFreakbynight guy
If you dont read anythings else in my reviews please understand this
1 This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump
2 If you are NOT in the market for spending around 110 a months for a services plan voices and data you have no business with this phone
This is a productiviy enhancer it is not 100 perfect but as a datas centers managers who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 systems notifications a days this phone does the tricks
The battery life isnt that bad as I have this things in its cradles not included during the day
Active Sync is so easy to setup a noob could do it
The only reasons reasons I didnt give it 5 stars is the facts that it cant make me a cocktail
This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia its quites popular in Singapore and the HTC TyTN in Europe but in an unlocked models
and quite a bits more expensive than what Cingular sells it for here
If you are using this as your first PDA phones from another non Windows product you will think its a heavy over feature laden products that you will never fully use and its a problematic ones at that
Having said that this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available todays
are such that you would never need to bring a laptops with you
There were initial problems with this phone in the Asian markets that have now been since resolved and is now robust and reliable
But one caveat to keep in minds when using this product
Meaning if you are not familiar with Windows devices it may frustrate you
But if you can overlook that it will perform better than anythings available
Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a tries on this brandnew 3GWificamera equipped smartphones
It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer services
Email and internets works very well in both locations
Additions of 1GB microSD chips actually solve many of the bluetooth files transfer issues since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette and use a cards reader and USB cables for file transfers from PC or Mac like other memories chips
The color calibrations and default focus of the camera is very good and videos is very good qualities for the cameraphone
Again 1GB allow you to take a very long videos in Windows Media Player format
Installation of Good mails systems automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails contacts and calendar any times any places and automatically chime schedules notices
The only drawback are the batteries life which require frequent charges slow keypad for phone calls and I do not know how to silence the keypads and a little tough keyboard touch
Lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult especially shiftA
In additions Microsoft Word processings is slow and so as Excel which will require a faster chips
Overall a great allaround pockets PC in this generations
I bought my 8525 when they first came out like two months ago right after christmas
I upgraded to a 2gig memory cards and also have the GPS services
I love my phone though it might have problems times to times and some getting used to
Overall this was the best purchases for the price I ended up spendings almost 900
but I also had the bluetooth essential packs the GPS and some other features
I would like to see the iPhones operating systems though
Yes you do have to restart the devices it does get hung but i dont blame the phone after all it has windows mobile 5 in it
The restart has occurred twice to me in the past weeks So be careful
Other than the facts that it has windows The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have
If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plans as even thought it has wifi capabilities Cingular has programed it to first connects to their data connects feature
Once you buy the phones i suggest that you get this software Spb Pocket plus
It helps shutting down softwares running in the backgrounds and adds more features
The screens clarity is amazing and it has great features
Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too
I bought this cable knowing by reading the reviews that it might not work so for the price I gave it a shot
This USB cables was a replacements for my other cable that was used as a chews toys by my dog
Since I already had DataPilot susteen software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computers with the phone attached it saw it as a susteen USB cable and installed all the drivers on winXPs if you dont have susteen driverssoftware you can obtain the drivers for the USB cable for your phones from their website free downloads
I never used the installation CDs that came with this USB cables and I installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes it also works with the DataPilot software but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830s
is like that it has free call waitings and free callers id
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer a friends programs will give each of us 100 free minutes
please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral
Once i got the phone activated I havent had any problems
Tracfone has a refer a friends program that will give each of 100 free minutes
All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral
Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majorities of us who lose things
Just unscrew the tip of the styli and youve got a pen
You never know when youll need one so when you do there it is
It also blends in well with the designs of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactilely
The product came promptly and I am happy with the qualities
However fitment wasnts perfects as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo
Not a huge problems but somethings I would feel everytime I reach for the styli
But the pen works pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands
I would definately recomment this product to others
This is the original and at half the prices of the newer charger this is a really great buys
Fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the V188
Fried my original one when used it abroad with wrong voltage
Shippings was a little steep for such and inexpensive items
I definetly will continue to do business with Amazon and A1 Accessories
Kind of difficult to place without getting some kind of stuffs between the screens and the protector
I recently bought a Nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some musics to it and create my own ringtones
However the Nokia CA53 cable was around 50 dollars
So far everythings that I have used it for is working flawlessly
I would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternatives than the CA53
This product helps you copy anythings on your computers to your nokia phone
Eforcity really did a good jobs shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them
Comes with an unlabeled cd couldnt tell one side from the other that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones arent labeled in any helpful way
It also has links to any 1st party software you need though Im sure a Google search would be just as easy
I bought this cases for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect
The belt clips is very strong making accidental unclipping rares
The pouch is made of reinforced leathers and nylons which protect the phone from any impacts
The fronts flap is also reinforced leathers and is secured closed by two magnets
The bottoms of the case has a small hole for access to the Chocolates End button
This allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phones from the case
The only dislike I have is the names Cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really a big deals
I would recommend this cases to anyones who owns a Chocolates
Ive had this cases for under a month but its working great
When I first got the cases I thought I was going to have to send it back because I thought it was too small for my phoneI have an LG CU500 from Cingular
The cases has since seemed to stretch a little so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out
The computer recognizes my phones when I plug it in but the drivers on the provided CDs are pretty much worthlesses
I needed a Razr Car Charger and the Crystal Clear Hard Shell Case was included with the purchases
I did not think I would even use it but I love it It is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great jobs of protecting my Razr phones
There are stick on belt clips that work fine with this
a nice bonus hard shells case that doesnt ruin Razrs stylish look a single bits
The charger wasnt very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable
I wasnt interested in the cases but after I got it I found it to be very useful and the best parts of the deal
Eventually prices will be free like the motorolas Razor V3
Reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory cards
Video and voice recording capabilities and a 8x zooms cameras
Im using it with TMobile so your mileages may vary
In my opinions its a featurepacked phone at a reasonable price for an unlocked smart phones at least
The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well although I did experience some lags and software freezes with thirdparties apps
I think the menus organizations could be smarter but you can customize much of it
I do love that the defaults screen displays your days calendar agendas
Photos with the 3megapixel cameras are grainy it also has a VGA cameras
Since this is a phones first and not a camera there is also no stabilizations controls
Your friends families and colleagues will hear you clearly
On your end however it will sound like youre talking on a cells phones
Its not bad but Ive had conversations on better sounding phones
I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet WLAN accesses
The problem is that if you arent at that location regularly you will have to search for a new networks
One way around it is to pony up the cashes for a datas plan through your wireless providers
I agree however that some kind of onebutton autodetects would be ideal
The metal cover pops off fairly easily as I found out while trying to insert my SIM cards without reading the manual first
The phones slider form factors moves smoothly perhaps too much so
By default sliding the phones completely open something thats hard but not impossible to do accidentally unlocks the keypad
Its 5way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than youd probably expect
The upshot is that the predictive texts feature is solid and sensible
When enabled it works contextually on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs
Overall I give this phones high marks for features but a few annoyances mean its far from The Perfect Phone
I got this phones 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousins in Singapore quite sometime back
Just right off the box the phone is quite impressive
Many complain about the response time yes this phones is slow but doesnt bother me far better than my windows machines Overall very good phone for what it offers
This phone tops in ergonomics ease of uses presentations features Bluetooth speakerphones and call quality
Nokias connection managers is far superior than anyones else in the market
It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several accesses points and save lots of monies
I accidentally downloaded a big chunks of data and going to pay through my nose next month
All the apps that come with this phones are quite good
Also I transfer musicthemesringtones using data cables from my Wintels
The phones automatically toggles to Mass storage mode when it is connected to PC which is pretty neat
I havent faced any such problems as I charge my gadgets daily
I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 23 days good enough for my calls volumes
Having the wifi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while youres at homes and then use it wisely while you are away
Camera settings are similar to professional cameras very very impressive
Battery life as many claim seems short but I charge my gadgets daily so not a big issues
The headsets that comes with the phone is really good
Tonnes of themes apps etc available for this phones
My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed
It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I selected an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left
My second biggest problem with this phones is when the sliders is on the screen light does not come up
So you wont know even in the days which buttons to press to answer the questions Unlock phone you will get that by practices but it is truly a pains
The picture what you see on the screens when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get
There is a serious lags between the shutter clicks and the final image
I sincerely hope if there would be some sw patch for this
I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras with an exceptions of Sony Ericsson W810i
That is one far superior cameras quality I saw so far
I am putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing
So you would need a small app to do the lockings properly
At this point Nokia has better phones like N95 etcs of courses very expensive
I think this is going to be a very good phone but the advertized prices on this web sites says retails is some 800
well I called NokiaUSA direct and regular retails from them is 499
all days as many as you want so it should be considerably less on Amazon
I recieved good customer services and excellent help from these guys
Thanks for allowing me to keep this phones with my networks
I didnt want to give it up just yet and you allowed me to get another phones just like the one I had
My V180 is through Cingular I never have a dropped calls and receptions is excellent
Long Battery life very easy menuswayfindings and small size
No frills like MP3 player or camera however just a very good phones
Ive had this phone for a year and a halves with no problems
It is good for making calls which is really all I ask for from a phone
It is easy enough to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and theyves had no problems
My carriers is Cingular and Ive had excellent service in the NY tristate areas and because it is a quadbands phone Ive also been able to use it while roaming internationally
Battery life is just okay not as good as my old Nokia
I have to recharge every other day with normal uses
Overall its lasted me long enough that I would call it a good value
If youre the types of person that doesnt spend HOURS on the phones and want a good basic phones this phones is for you
I bought this phone in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great
I would say that the only gripes about this phones in the US is the prices I wouldnt pays over 40 bucks for it
The screens is a colored one and it has cool ringtones
It didnt seem possible that the stuffs would actually work for such a low price
Even though shipping was steep it was still worth the monies
The case fits great and it hasnt cracked at all
Both chargers work great I think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this walls charger than the one that came with it but I cant complain I would highly recommend this package
just for the cars chargers alone verizon wanted 24
the plastics covers for the phones is very good as the razrs phone scratches pretty easily
The chargers might feel a little light weights or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality
Helps reduce clutter and now I can actually close my cup holders tray Acura RDX
It is very compact when retracted and when the cords is extended it doesnt gets in the ways like the spiral cords do
I never measured the cord when extended but it is much longer than most
You go to your services providers stores and buy a car charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fractions of that prices and buy one of these and it works so much better
The retractable cord is an awesome features you can actually talk on the phone while your drivings because the cords is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular or sprints stores
Ive had it for about 2 months and I am still happy with it
It has a little blues led lights that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but I like it
I like the ways it doesnt take up space in the consoles when I am not using it and it seems to charge the L6 just fine No complaints with the devise or the services from Amazon
ive had this chargers for the last couples of months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it
It is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone
Car chargers serves it purpose it charges the cell phone in a cars or any cigarette lighters
You just need to make sure you plug the connectors in the right way
I would have liked some type of labels that would have identifed it as a motorolas compatible devices
The cord is a little short but have had no functionalities issues
It was exactly what I needed and works as well as one that would have cost me 20 or more in the stores
I purchased this batteries becuases my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of serviceso it was times
It does last longer and Im glad I bought this battery
I have no bad reviews about this so if you have an audiovoxes 8910 cell phones and you need an replacementthiss is the one
It is the standard Palm battery meaning it is probably underpowered relatives to the power consumption of the devices
Notes also that when using Bluetooth andor the Blackberry Rim email services batteries lives is notably reduced
The solutions would be lower device consumption or a bigger capacities battery neithers of which appear possible at the moments
It installed very easily with no bothers and has functioned perfectly since the first day
It has far out performed and put to shame the more expensive bulkiers units it replaced
This navigations system is truly a useful tools when traveling in areas you are not familiar with
I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell and opted to pay a little bit more for a products that appeared to be top notch
The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use
Cosemetically it looks great with professional attires or with casual clothing The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards This is an excellent product
I used to forget my wallets but I always had my blackberries so I bought this then since I take my phones every where but not my wallets This salved the problems
This is good for people who forget their wallets or phone but remember to bring the other
I love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one
It is just nice to have to keep up with one less things
I highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff
These are well worth the monies for your Nextel Phone Although it may not list it from Experience these batteries fit 95 of all the Nextel phones
Take a looks at your phones batteries to see if its the same shape
The colors will be different as these have a white cover
They are a good twenties dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular stores
Plus these were NEVER used before Unlike the celluars stores batteries these batteries come in a boxes with the batteries in shrink wrap so you know the batteries has not been used
When you buy then in the cellular stores they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed and youd never know it plus there is no shrinks wrap Ever buy a batteries from a cellular stores and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months Hmmm I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one Would you know
These batteries are well worth it Buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergencies or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days
This chargers works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
It is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone
This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional batteries
However it seems expensive for what you get not to mention the facts that what the text doesnts tell you is that you need an additional expensive serial cableadapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable
Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same times save money and just get the nifty travel chargers with the foldings plug for the bargain prices
and just place the phone down on your desks or tabletops while it charges
i couldnt believe how small it is compare to the pictures i saw online
however one bad thing about that is that i lost it already
i would recommand it to anyones who thinking about buying one
When I lost my Stylus I had a difficult time finding a replacements
Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phones models A630 A850 A950 A970 A930 A990 A645 and A870
The thin adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phones at home or office
I originally bought another Motorola chargers from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one
I returned the other ones because this one worked just as good if not better It actually fully charges my phone in less times and I can swear my batteries lives lasts even longer
Its a great product for a great prices Delivery was quick too
It fits like a glove and protects the phones while allowing you to view the screens unlike other cases
Made of interesting flexible materials that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymers
All buttons of the phones are accessible through the cases
The belts clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belts and easily remove and reinstall it on the belts clips without taking the belt clip off of your waists
You can not accesses the keyboard without removing the phone from the cases
The clear plastic screen that covers the phones screen is a little to far from the surfaces of the phones screens
This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screens with the styli near the corners of the screen
The clear plastics screen protector may stretch with uses and make this easier but Im not sure
On the positive side you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online
The screen is perfect for texts but not for pictures
Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots
I expected to use it like a typical pilots where you write on the screen
Good reception great sound qualities Speakerphone is great Neat features
The Treo600 has all the functions I needed phones calendar camera etc
1 the screens is not good for viewing pictures but thats what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo650
2 the phone failed to dial two times in two months
I had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problems
This is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen
It has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glares but the frostings is impossible to see when the screens is on
Ive washed ours it comes out clean as new and the sticky sides stays sticky
Just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place
It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bend it IT WILL NEVER GO BACK
Durable thick doesnt interfere in any ways with the touches screen
I havent had to wash it yet so I havent tried out that feature
But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low costs of one of these its been totally worth it to me hey after spending hundreds on your Treo whats a few dollars
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anythings youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screens protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screens hope against hope that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screens is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screens is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animals
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first times
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good
This is the states of the art for screens protectors
And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over times the screen will get dulled and scratched
Because of the thickness and qualities of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
I had it up and running in minutes with my LG VX8600 Verizon
I downloaded BitPM free software to use with the cables
I just followed the installation instructions that came on the CDs that comes with the cable
I clicked on discovers phone in BitPM to have it automatically find the phones
I didnt even need to go and look for the com port as the installations says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phones
When installing make sure you pick the right driver
if you have XP choose the XP driver not the NT or Win98 or other driver
My only complaints is in the descriptions they dont states the lengths of the cables
My tower for my computers is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly
I had to extend this cables by soldering on another 3 feet of wire as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my walls
I projected the cables to be about 6 feet and if you do yourself youres in for a surprise
This cables is only about 3 feet long otherwise everything is fine
The descriptions doesnts state this but the cables actually comes with the drivers for the phones models which really helped me
On a better notes shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated
I have a VX9900 enVs and this cable works great with it in conjunction with BitPIM
Not much to say about it really it does what it should
got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pms and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everythings awesome deals for 3 bucks
Driver installations is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install
No synchronizations software is included so you have to use a thirdparty tools like bitpim
I ordered this cables on December 1st got it on the 8th
It came with drivers but I didnt need it because I found drivers online
The cables fits perfectly with my LGVX9900 and to my surprise it charges too
I recently purchased the black metals cases for my 8525 and have had a few problems wit
First the belts clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt
Second the aluminums cases isnt the sturdiest so now its sort of bent referring to the hinge I guess Ive been really rough on my phones but I just bend it back to where its supposed to be referring to the hinges
my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it
When I informed the vendors that the belts clips broke I just wanted a new clips instead I recieved a full refund so that was a pleasant suprises
I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone
The K790a is currently the best Cybershot cameras phones in Sony Ericssons lineups but more are on the ways and also handsdown the best camera phones in the U
Its too bad that SE doesnt sell their 5MP and 6MP cameras phones stateside
But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera
Sure its only 3MP but like many professionals will tell you pixel counts is only one things
This 3MP camerainaphone takes betterlooking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar Aptech sp Samsung and other offbrands companies
My main phones is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phones but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaids SIM cards I was simply blown away by the qualities
Of course I bought the phone exactly because I had heards of great things about its pictures quality but the results still far exceeded my high expectations
I dont care for the MMS features because my prepaid service Speak Out Wireless doesnt supports them
I just download them to my PC using a USB cards readers
I wish there were optical zooms more and more cameras phones in Japan including models from Casio now have optical zoom but the truths is of courses that if you need serious picturetaking you still use a real digital camera
But this comes real close to replacing your workhorses digicams
Ill use this for a years and upgrades to SEs next gens next years hopefully by then theyll have released optical zoomequipped K phones
Receptions is pretty good on the TMobile Cingular networks used by Speak Out Wireless
Pictures are amazing for a phone MP3 player could use a little help
Screen is beautiful and as always menu interfaces is a treats
The phone is Java 2 compliant however many programs that run in the background will not notify be able to notify you unless the programs is open
Very other than the MP3 player and Java notifications issues the phone is a 5
purchased the phones about 3 months like the nice QVGA screens and impressed with excellent cams it works pretty well in macroes modes and outdoors
the phone has good reception at least on par with W810
voices call is OK but as other users stated the level is kinda low esps speakerphones firmwares upgrade R1KC001 will help
the operations is standard SE styles if you are familiar youll be OK without reading manual
the audio players can play streaming 3gp and realaudios still used by BBC and it works well with TMobile internets it can play local mp3s VBR supported wma asf audios rename the extension to
wma realaudios but I wish it supports oggs vorbis which is the audio format I use
bluetooth works pretty well it works with ALL bt equipment I have including wireless headphones
logitech headphones users please read in order to make the headphones works properly you need to go to bt menus and connects from there
web browsers can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html and wap sites
the phones is kinda bulkies and a bulges on cam covers but its pretty comfortable and firms to hold making messaging is a good pleasure
though the phone has lot of functionsfeatures are pretty appealing it lacks something its supposed to have
quadband this is not acceptable for this price even many lower models have quadband K550 W610 W580 W810 Z710 W710
music player should have more file formats support ogg vorbis streamimgs wmaasfs shoutcast
m2 memories card though the phone has possibilities to support up to 32GB PSP card is a lots cheaper
QVGA screen and it shows clocks when the phones is idle
low earpieces and speakerphone level though firmware upgrades will fix
conclusion if you want a phone with excellent screens and cam go for it however if you travel a lots settle with quadbands models theyre cheaper
Ive had 3 cell phones prior to this one all Motorola and I really thought they were all pretty good phones
However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water Its very compact and durable you can tell it was made with an incredible levels of qualities controls
This is why I bought the phones now I am never without a camera
The flashes is good and strong so it takes great pictures with good foci
I dont really use the mp3 features because I have an iPod
However I was VERY disappointed that it wouldnt allow me to use mp3ss as ringtones
I heard this was because my services provider is a jackasses and not the phones faults though
With a little bit of forum browsing I was able to hack my ways around this if you have this problems email me at skibum2801yahoos
now I have my very own customs ringtones that come out as clear as days with the nice speakers
I feel as if Im simply using my homes phones its so great
The buttons took a little bits to get used to because I was a Motorola girl for so long but I picked it up quickly and now I have no issues
Pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carriers
Super easies to upload pictures straight to Flickr via phones
This is a top sellings handsets in Europe but tricky to get holds of in the US which is still relatively in the darks ages when it comes to mobile technologies
Coming from a SonyEricsson T637 I was familiar with the SE UI so getting used to this phone was relatively easy for me
I love the camera it takes amazing pictures and the musics players serves my needs just fine
Supports for a memory card is a huge pluss I have a 1 GB Sandisk M2 Micro card and now I never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos
This phones also allows for extensive customizations in terms of shortcuts and themes ringtones and so forth which is another plus
As far as negatives for the phone I only have a few minor ones the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet and the cameras lens cover sometimes slides open in my pockets but neither of these would convince me not to get this amazing phones its quite possibly the single best phone Ive ever owned Definitely very happy with this purchases
Es el mejro celular q pude encontrar tars pasar 2 meses leyendo Reviews en mils paginas
mps un screens de colores hermosos radio video movies mp3 bluettoth memory card buenos acesesorios incluidos Es el mejor celular del mercads
EDGE device makes internets data fairly quick and usable as PCs modem via bluetooth
cameras lens cover needs a locks switch ours opens just walking around and takes pictures of the lints in my pockets very annoying
sleep timer is a bit quick and should be adjustable
I shouldnt expect it thinner since it is the size of a very small digital cameras but Id still like it slimmer
The xenon flashes really helps taking night pictures
I use to own the w800i and this one takes ways better pictures
It has autofocus and other several fucntion that i havent used yet
I love how u can just drag and drop mp3s files to the phones
It also very easy to navigate through the phones functions
My computer had no problems recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded
The only complains i have about this phone is the headphones
Walkman series have ways better headphones so when you get this makes sure to buy new headphones and adapter
Another complains is the expensive memories stick micros
and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phones I have ever owned
It has also replaced my camera and I am now never without a camera
I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited
They dont give the phones a second glance not realizing its got the 3
I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows
After throwing in a 1GB memories stick I think it was 79 it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300 pics right now
The movie function rocks too however you are going to want to be up very close to the subjects
The sound playbacks of the movies is fantastic though so at least concert videos make for good listening
If I throw it on the USB cables it pops up instantly as another drives just like the camera
If I dont care about viewing the files and just want to move stuffs on and off the phones I dont even take it out of my pocket
The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around
Also very cool was that it pops up on my computers as a Modem which I actually was able to use immediately in my PCs Anywhere program
The contacts list is easy to work with the call clarities is no issue at all good signals no dropped calls etc
It needs charging about every 3rd day charges very quickly
Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges
The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cables to charge it only wants to charge it to 89
If I want 100 I have to throw it on the real chargers for a few minutes
I paid 14 as much for this products and it works just as well as the names brands products
The products was delivered in a timely manners and functions properly
The photo of this Premiun Side case is not at the Photo
The side cases in the photos have a Treo Logo and the productoes dont have i
I tried one of the Seidio shields holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car
The clips just wouldnt grips my belt securely enough
I gave up after the 3rd times my Treo 650 hit the concrete
Most of the times I just slip the thing in my left pockets but that doesnt work so well with some pants especially jeans
I decided to try the Treo leather case and I like it quite a bits
The clips is strong and I find it easy to get the phone in and out of the cases
This is the third case I tried for my Treo 650 and its simplicities is its key to successes
My first case had a flapping pieces of leather that cost 35 and was totally useless
My second skins had a belts clips that whenever I bent over to tie my shoes for examples the phones would disengage from the clips and fall on the floors Simply bad designs
This well designed Premium Side Case is easy to use easy to wear and gives excellent protections
When the phone is in vibrate modes you are always aware when you get a call pages or email
Its small enough that its not a problems when worns with a suits and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt
Good designs is always fashionable and the case is well made
I used to carry my Treo 600 with the original case that came with the device
But soon I found out that the original case is kinds of loose and my Treo fell out from it once
Luckily it was on a carpet so no damage at least no visual damages
After that incidents I started looking for a better cases and this ones is what I found
What can I say you dont know how bulky Treo is until you wear one on your belts
The case does its job it provide a nice and secure protections for Treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway so you dont have to carry it around with your hand or in you pocket which barely fit
But Treo is quite heavy and its thick so you will definitely aware your Treo is hanging on your belt
And sometime I just feel like its too much a burden and I want to get it off me
But overall I still prefer to have this than the original case
And the heavinesses is not this cases faults should blame Handspring now PalmOne for not making it lighter
This cases is great for protecting my Treo but the downsides is that I have to remove it from the case to use it
I purchased it because I had actually dropped my Treos when walking with it balanced on my portfolio now I clip it to the portfolios and it is secure and safe and I dont run the risks of leaving it behind
Dont waste your time looking for another case this is the best
How come phone accessories dont qualify for prime shippings How are they different from other electronics
The only negative comment that I will make about the cases is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phones out of the case due to the snug fits
Amazon has the best price for the cases and it is well worth the prices
The fit is snug and secure enough not to fall off and get lost
The silicones protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this products for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thicknesses somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thicknesses gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phones on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the designs of this units as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skins but easy to press
The protective skins is a bit too thick for some applications GPS cars holders but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantages is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical docks
This was customs formed for every curve bump and buttons on the Treos
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attentions to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screens
The button layouts is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skins has images on the buttons covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a ways to remove these somehows
Driver install was easy and Bitpim accesses works just fine
The cable I received also charges the phones VX8300 from Verizon
I agree with previous reviewers Gely ZenCity regarding this cable
The price was right sets up was easy and with the Bitpim program you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently
I loaded my whole Outlook calendars and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones
Dont waste your monies buyings and downloading ringtones or music from Verizons sites VCast and such just hook this cable up between computers and phones and load your phone up with the musictones that you already own
You will likely need some types of additional software to actually DO anything with the phones
I ordered this cable two of them actually to use on the LG 8300
The drivers disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300
I used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phone
I was unable to locate a datas cables locally and was happy to find one on Amazon even though it was only available through a third parties
All in all I recommend the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300
For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 pleases be aware there appears to be no drivers included for your phones
However I already had a drivers that I knew worked so I did not use the disc
Products is excellent and does all it is supposed to do
I was very pleased when I got this cells phones case
I was really frustrated with my phone before purchasing this cases
I kept on getting the screens dirty every time I made a calls
It feels good it has kind of a rubber feels and the insides is cloth
It protects my phones I have two boys and while they are supposed to not touch dads phone it has an almost 100 chance of getting dropped sooner or later
Like the other guys mentioned the clear plastics covers the camera a little but not a big deals cameras is not so hot anyhow
I have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best
The rubber suits covers every bits of the phone so I am confident that I wont be getting any scratched
You can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched
There is a straps that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isnt going to fall out
3 minor qualms The sees through plastic has a little glares on it especially when there is oils between the LCD and the suits
Also it adds just enough weights that it flips open with a little knocks
noticed this most when having the phones horizontally mounted on my belt
Last the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the cameras
You already know the v710ss cameras is crap for its spec but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap
I just got this chargers yesterdays and it feels really nice
It feels solid and professionally made not some cheap imports special
I like the blues LED light instead of the typical red dot
Also the cords is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same times the coil keeps it out of the ways when you have the phone down just charging
The IC chip is important so that you dont overcharge your phone battery and shorten its life
The only problems is that it can only hold the standard batteries so your out of lucks if youres using the extended batteries for your A920 phone
Other than that its a very nice and stylish case for the Samsung A920 phones
top part of telephone gets loose very often elastic band apparently looses its elasticities easily
I have a 6255i phone and used the cable to connect to a windows XP homes systems
Installations was seemless and the drivers from XP worked just fine and recognized the cables immediately
Downloaded the Nokie suite software from the Nokia sites to work with the cables and phone and that also worked just fine
Cellphones companies wanted 50 bucks for the same cable
Use this one you will save monies and its the same cable
The cable came faster than expected I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow
The cables came with the software driver although I did not need it and worked great with my already installed Nokia Sync software
Electro Island had the best price by far and the service was excellent

It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier

Bluetooth can not be accessed when the phones is in the pouch
I was so easy and fast to order and the people I bought it from seemed to make it easier
I have had no problems with chargers and am very happy with my purchases
I dont need to buy stuff online when now I can download it straight to my PC
makes it easy to transfer Pictures videos ring tones contact numbers
My original charger broke that caome wit the cells phones
I was going to go buy a charger but they cost like 30 if you get the name brands
This one I purchased does the tricks and saved me lots of money
I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand chargers I got with the phone
While it does charge I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98
I am unsure however if this is because my batteries is less effective than when new
This holsters is by far better than the stocks holster that comes with the phones
It has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt
It is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holsters
The thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy inout
This items costs 1 penny of course the shippings was 4
84 but I thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores
Ive had it for two weeks and it hasnt broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally
Order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phones holsters
This belt clips was exactly what I was looking for and the prices was great
If I could change one thing the swivel action is just a little looser than I would like but definatly not a problems
Ive had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now and I just love it I am very new to all this fancy cells phone stuff the last one I had was bare bones basic
It is great having a phone that you can do so much with
The camera is so handy since I never remember to take my other cameras anywhere with me and the mp3s players and radios are also great to have
The musics aspects of this phones are really what sold me on it I had been looking at seperate mp3s players for awhile now and hadnt made up my mind until I saw this phone and what an awesome deal it was
You just cant beat a one cents phone with free shipping and 75
00 in rebates TMobile had my old Net10 phones number ported to the new phone in 2 days The customer service people have been so nice and the abilities to buy ringtones wall paper and myfaves icons right on the phone from TZones is awesome
I also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account plans info right on the phones
The only issues I have been having is finding accessories for itmy usual discounts accessories shops dont have much yetIm assumings because the phones is so new but Im sure that will get resolved soon
yes its a ties with the Sony Cybershot K790a for the best multimedia phone so far on the market at least until the iPhones will show up then the games is on again
is am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile contracts for 2 more years and get this phones for 100 or drop my previous one and get a new contracts
For less than the costs of an offical Verizon travel charger you get a travel charger homes charger and a USB cables with driver CD
The instructions for the USB cables are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use Windows Media Player to move music over to your phones using the Sync features and you can use a free programs such as BitPim to do other file transfers between your PCs and phone
Some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine but they were unable to get the data cable to work
However I found no such problems and successfully used the data cable to transfer files off of my phones
After installing the drivers just search the web for a programs called BitPim
Its not exactly the nicest looking software but gets the job done
I got the a datas transfer cables the house and cars charge cheaper than what I would have paid for the car charger alone
I have been using this piece for the last one years and its quites a decent one
It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed
An ample speakers phones and wonderful cams can come handy at times
I recently had a problems with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by T mobile
If you want a cell phone that is well made looks good feels good to use and is a really good phones as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the V360 is an excellent choices
It has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call qualities or battery lives to a bunches of useless features that I dont want
it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasures to use
I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlockedunbranded and it was of the quadbands varieties
Durability this things was built with the clumsy in minds like me
I must have dropped this things a dozens times and theres barely a scratch
MP3 players I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke but with the costs of TranshFlash memory coming down I bought my 512MB chips on eBay for 7
That being said the MP3 players is a feature you will actually USE and the sound qualities is good
Ive had no problem with playing my iTunes music as long as theyres mp3s format AND no greater that 192Kbps in qualities then it will play fine
Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats you need to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either programs to rip to mp3 format you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menus
Programmable smart keys I read where one user complained that the cameras button was not on the side it was the camera icon button on the fronts keypad
He must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the Personalize menu
Not only that but you can rearrange the menus buttons and programs most of the buttons on the faces for frequently used apps
You may not use these features outofthe box but theyres for the times when these technologies are more commonplaces
I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files mp3s pics etc to my phone with my laptops
This phones works on 850 900 1800 and 1900 GSM networks although that has not been personally tested
However I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and Ill know for certain by then
Theres a slight delays when you answer a calls I usually have to say helloes 23 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak
I dont know if this is a carrier problems or the phones
The light stays on while charging even when the phones is powered off
You really need to upgrade the memories if you want to do anythings extra with the phone
It has a monochrome outers display full colors inside
This doesnts bother me at all but its not as flashy as Razr or other phones
This is a great durable little phone with handy features I think people will actually use
Ive reads where people complain about the picture qualities but thats what a digital camera is for
If you want a good qualities cell phone thats well designed users friendly and doesnt looks like a trickedouts teenagers phone then this is the phone for you
As usual Motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all its more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal
Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the times to the read the manual
My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory
Despite having something like five Meg of memories on the phones and a Micro SD memories card thats it
The sizes of the text messages doesnt seem to matter
This is a great phones that Ive used for a years now
Id like to highlight the standouts features that make this phones unique especially at its prices
Just get an adapters for the usb port a few bucks on eBays and you can plug in your stereo headphones
Too bad they havent offered an updates to the Motorola Digital Audio Player
You can take a MicroSD card put it into the included adapter and plugs into an SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s you can take any mp3s and make it your ringtone cropping it will make it more effective 3GP videos animation looks great but the sounds was slightly out of sync search the webs for videos converters to convert your contents or pictures
I love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them
I got an Explorer 320 headset for 20 and it works great with it
Easily slide off the cover and pops in a fresh ones
The batteries lives isnt very long so its good to have a spare batteries theyres cheaps
Not high quality videos but its something the old RAZR couldnt do
You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the top of the keypad and the directional pads to go directly to most functions of the phones
It even has a shortcut lists to list all your favorite features
You can easily make any pictures including pics you take into your wallpaper
Also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phones unique
Good for using automated phone menu systems and when youres put on holds
The speakers is loud and great for ringtones and mp3ss
The plastic may resonate at certain sounds though
VIBE THEN RING Why doesnt every phone have this It should be the default standard for all phones
The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pockets
If you are one to show off your ringtone let it move onto ring otherwise be descreets and answer immediately

All the lettering on the outsides as well as some cases paints has rubbed off
I carry my phone in my pocket so the phones has aged a bit
I scraped off the remainders of the lettering so it wouldnt look half worn off

All the great features is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509s or other more expensive phones
This phones just has all the feefree features you could want
if the cell is in my back pocket jeans the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signals break up
I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headsets and find it more than adequates
The ability of using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect
Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmicks
So you throw your headsets and charger away and buy a new one
Depending on your ear structure the fits can be either formfitting or loose
From reading the other reviews here one can infer this
Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or device it pairs to would make a differences in performances
Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volumes or allowed some static
For me and others we experienced no such problem
Best bet is to check the return policy if you find that it doesnt meet your standards
But if it works for your device you have a headsets that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talks times on 1 AAA Alkaline battery
And you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea
If it also fits your ears comfortably then you have a winner
I can use it daily for an hour or so every days on a single AAA for at least two weeks
It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot
I use this headsets with both a Treo 650 phones and a Apple PowerBook G4
On the Apple I can use it as a generic outputs devices
The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away on the Treo 650 the signal is not nearly as good
like driving or in a hotels rooms with the airs conditioners fan blowing fullblast OR if the people on the other ends is not talking very loudly then its sometimes hard to hear
the call goes back to my cells phones when the battery is getting low
You can milk it a while longer but thats really your first clues about the batteries
The earpieces is OK its not as secures as Id hope
If youre outside in a gust you may want to hang on to it
Also people on the other ends sometimes can tell Im on a headset with this ones they mention that I sound a little staticky
This is my first bluetooth headset so perhaps my rating is higher just because its a nifty gadget
But the batteries lives on this is really the winners my workmates have rechargeable headsets and it seems like theyre always having to charge them
I use rechargeable NiMH AAAs and they just last a really long time with this unit
I bought this headsets for internets chats with my husbands when he travels for business
The sounds qualities is good volumes more than adequates and my husband does not hear any echo
I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a chargers
All you need is a spare batteries and no worries about the devices dying when the internal batteries dies
The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear
It would be nice if it bent for a custom fit but I am pretty happy with it
Easy to pair with my phone Motorola SLVR L7 European Version
Have not had a complaints about echoes as other reviews stated
Price affordable but acts like an expensive headsets
22 Hours of talks time before battery has to be replaced
I would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headsets
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best
There is no finers quality and the selections of products is well above the rest
Krusell products cost a little more but qualities and durabilities far surpass the price
It works beautifully with my Treo 700p smartphones
I love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the devices with the touches of a buttons making the whole units quick and easy to store
The only complaint Ive heard is that the large blue power lights is too bright at nights
It doesnt annoy me but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down so the blues glows doesnts shine up into her eyes
The retractable cords keeps it out of the ways and it extends out far enough to use the phone
My complaint with all Palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connectors and they break
But the prices on this ones is good enough that you should buy 2
This is an excellent product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hiding its styles
I chose Treo because of its unique looks and excellent features however the cases from Palm didnt work for me because I use the phone a lot and I dont have times to put the phone back in the case everytimes
So it gets thrown in my purses along with other items which then scratch it
I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phone while in it it hides the Treos real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag
I loved it and to prevent my hand slips from dry hands anyone who are crazy over that color
had a return and they replaced it no questions asked
Good battery life certainly much better than the old one it replaced
For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original
However it doesnt fit quite as snugly in the dockstyle charger that came with my phones not the kinds that plugs into the bottom of the phones but the kinds that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly
That is a little annoying that it tends to fall out if Im not paying attentions Ill wake up the next morning and my phones wonts actually have been charged but it still works
This batteries saved me from renewing the contractthus the battery was a contract killers
I thought I was going to get a new phones as this battery is 49
The products is probably a decent product but it doesnt works in my vehicles 04 Jetta
I think it has to do with the parts you plug into the cigarrettes lighter being to long
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised charges the phones in about 15 minutes of driving
I couldnt believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price
Everythings is still working well i am very happy with my purchase
The cable is exactly what I needed and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives
Drivers provided on the accompanying CDs worked but were not as complete as I would have liked
I am still very satisfied as it was only the cable that I was really after especially for the prices at which I bought it
The vehicles phone chargers I received was not the ones pictured as for sale
It does however appear to be equal in features
I have now used this products and find that it does not work to charge my V170 cells phones
I have since purchased the Motorola charger more expensive and it works perfectly
This cars chargers does what it is spposed to do and the price is right
You might have to pay a little bit more but the reliabilities offered by OEM products gives one much peace of minds
I am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if I know what I am getting is not just a counterfeit
After reading reviews here user forums I decided to purchase this
It can charge a secondary battery in the rear compartments AND can charge
the extended lives batteries as well while the Q is on the chargers
The three color LED indicators is added benefit wa simples guide
The chargers can not overcharge the batteries which is an added benefits
And you can easily accesses the Q while on the charger for SMS texts using any app
or even using the speakers phone while on the desktop charger
Motorola should include this with each Motorola Q phones as standard equipment
Great product works quickly when charging my Moto V555 in the car
I simply wanted a data cable to connect my Verizon cells phones to my Macintosh so I could transfer and synchronize data
Verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on Windows machines
This was a WHOLE lot cheaper than the Verizon dealers wanted for this product
My only disappointment was that it didnt have clear instructions which was LGs fault
covers fits great and for the price is could not find anything better was at the local malls and saw a cover that was the same for around 17
I just bought this case a few weeks ago and its holding up very well
Well I hope this things will last for many months down the tough road
I would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from wich colors are there this is because i would like to pay only one shippings fee
the cases looks great and it is very slim fitting so the phones doesnts looks bulks
This was delivered as an OEM product exactly as expected
I bought one of these extended batteries on ebays and was really sorry
I was reluctant to try again but I was glad I did
This times I got a good quality batteries and it holds a charges at least twice as long as my old batteries
I only have to charge the new battery every 2 3 days
I have tried a dozens screens guards some of them shine a lots some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hr to stick on the screens without any airs bubble
And yea the best part is its static not gum and its washable
The touch screen protectors for my 8525 is very nice
The onwly reasons is didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dusts or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backings and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen easier sad than done
If anythings does attach it doesnt seem to affect the functions of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible airs bubles trapped between the screens and the protective layer
I have had it for some time now I got it for my 11th birthday
I have reviewed the cingular version too even though mines verizon
Very short battery life I have to charge it almost every days
Cameras The pictures you take cant moves or it comes out all messed up
Recording videos Even though you get 15 seconds I still use that to make funny videos with my friends
Its styles I love the color and style My friends are all jealous
Personally I think if you are buying any sorts of Razr for its functionality you are buying the wrong phones
I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not be as small lights and attractive as Motorola phones LG phones are built to last
However if you are just looking for a cutes phones that is easy to carry in your pursepocket and to use just as a nice looking phone this is a great one to own
I previously had the LG VX9800 before I bought the pinks Motorola Razr V3c
I had the VX9800 because when I was in college I would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes
However now that I am in the working worlds and basically only use my phone to call people I wanted a phones that was easier to carry around and was cutes
I dont recommend this phone if your phones is your lifeit doesnt do much
However if you are just going to be using it to make calls and send the occasional text its wonderfuls
The pink colors that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeousits almost a purpleypinkish lavendars color
In my opinion this pink is prettier than the TMobile magentas and much much much nicers than the Cingular pinks I am not a fans of that one at all
In essence if youre looking for a highteches phones this is not it
If youres looking for a lightweight attractive phones just to use for calls and some textings this is a great buy
I just got my pink razrs phones and I love it so far
i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones
Even though it does not have an antenna on the outsides that you can see it still it works well
I was scared to buy this phones because I read some of the reviews and some of them werent saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it
When I first got my Motorola Q I was disappointed with the standard batteries and was having to charge the batteries every nights or be caught with a dying battery in mid days
With some setting changes and the 1700 mAh battery that is now far in the past
A little fatter than the regular batteries which means a very tight squeezes in my Qholder but the extra powers makes a big differences
I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protectors only but also a squeegeem cloth and cleaning instructions
This shield fits very nicely over my phones screen
My friend from HK just got this phones and ask me to buy her an Eforcity screen protector
Hes been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up
Its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 players but I digress
The screen protect works as describeds it comes with a polish cloths and a plastings squeegee aplicator
The film has some kinds of electrostatic polymers theres no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screens
Squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed
It definitely improves the grips on the Blackberry especially when Im using it as a phones
It also serves as an excellent protectors when I throw it in my purse
My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases
Come on guys Women use these items too Also the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that Ive had this case
Other than those two things this is a great not bulky case
it is small and compact easy for travels but also good for homes uses
I am very satisfied with the holsters for my motorolas phone
I would recommend this holsters to anyone who needs one for a work phones that is easy to carry and get to when needed
I use my belts holsters with all the phones ive owned my i530 is no
This belts holster feels really well made it has a strong belts clip which is good for how hard I use it
A big pluss is that I can use my phones while its in the holster
works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate and can be used to adapt your lg phone to what ever you wan
An extra Lithium battery is ideal for the new i860s cameras phones
The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare batteries readies for those last minute low batteries alerts
I have found the 750 mah Lithium Ion Battery to be dependable nomatters at what stage of the remainngs battery lives you begin recharging
It doesnt weakin as did my i1000s batteries when charging started at mids ranges
However the first times you charge or recharge your Lithium batteries is the most important charge of all
You must let the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the batteries
The deader the batteries on its first run the better the lives of the battery and standby time for charges to come
I am in northern Ohio and travel many places around the states
No matters where I have gone and I take my phone everywhere with me I have yet to find a places where my phone doesnts have Nextel services
I live on a farm here and we use the twoways often to communicate
My phone in particulars has been dropped several times once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below and once also driven over by four wheeler in muds
I am extremely happy with Nextels services and phones
I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also cant complains
I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon Alltel Cingular and Sprint
Its a shames that Sprint and Nextel merged from my experience with Sprint they are terrible with no service anywhere and their phones suck too
I have used the i530s for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit or with NEXTELs service
To simplify your readings here is a list of pros and cons
Cons A little chunky Lacks up to date features and tech such as colors screens external display etcs
Pros Durability been dropped off a roof still going strong Looks yellow model Call qualities is excellent Good speakerphones Digital 2way is a great feature
The only issues among the cons that is of any real concern is the batteries life but this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones perhaps due to the nature of the iDENs networks on which they operate
Even after two years my original batteries lasts more than a day with moderate use
A pains Slightly but given the advantages of NEXTEL its worth remembering to charge up more often
Please bewares of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below my experience with their coverages customers services etcs
Just make sure you do your homework with respects to coverages before you sign up with any wireless companies
Go with the one that gives the best coverages in the areas in which you live work or travel
Its always best to actually put the printed coverages maps to the test with a real phone
NEXTELs maps are pretty legit at least as far as I have discovered
For two years now I have not had any problems with my Motorola i530s cell phone which is serviced by TelusNextel
Over all I would rates the service as good not excellent
Rarely I will have troubles getting service in a area where I would normally get a strong signals
This problems will normally last for roughly under a minute before my phones is once again operational
Im a daily commuter between Canada and the United States
My phones doesnts miss a beat it will automatically switch from Telus a Canadian servers to Nextel an American server and still have the same great receptions
The cells phone itself is big bulky heavy and ugly
It does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or videos features
It does have a direct connect feature so you can use your phones like a walkytalky when talking to a friends with the same option on their phone
The receptions on the phones is clear and crisp it will seldom cut out of the conversation
Therefore I did not expect the qualities of the sound of down loaded music to be so poor
I have thrown my phones across a rooms to a friends who failed to catch it more then once
One of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces
On a road trips my phone had fallen off my laps out of the car and sat on the side of the roads for three days in the rain
I had recharged the phone and it worked as expected
My phones has never let me down I have always gotten service and the batteries has not died on me thus far
The battery when fully charged will last for about thirties hours in low to moderate usages
If you are looking for a quality phones built to with stand punishments and do not desire all of those new phone gimmicks this phones is for you
i have this nextels it works verry good ims verries happy with it
What can I say It works very well I keep this in my car so when I travel I dont have to worry about my Palm TXs batteries
This is the 5th Palm treo cases I have bought in the last few years and it is the best by far
It holds the treos snugly without the needs for a top magnets or velcro flap
The clips is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alots
I was just looking for a simple belts carrier that would protect my Treo 700p but would allow complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it
In other words I didnt want something that was attached to the Treo permanently
There is one complaints sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk
I have the i850s but the i560s is what my wife has been using for about 3 months
The phones is so good my 2 years old cant destroy it hes tried Theres only 3 things I dont like about it it doesnt have a very big screen the external screens isnt color and it has no cameras
Other than that its pretty much the same as the higher priced models like the i850
and holding them together I suspect that they in fact have the same electronics inside minus the 3 things I mentioned above
If you dont take pics this really is the phones for you You can even submerge this thing in water and it will still work without needing anythings special It has GPS built in and all the javas appss
Its everything the higher priced models have minus the cameras and a smaller screen
Even though the screens is smaller its colors and very legible
The Motorola i560 is nicely sized easy to use and indestructible
These features are what to look for when looking for a new cell phones
Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones such as the i710 but it is the unbreakable model with outside display
Sizes is important especially with Nextel because most of their early models are very big and awkward like the i710s
The i560s is perfectly in between massive and tiny
This is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas
It is equipped with grippings as well which helps when it comes to using the direct connects placing calls and receiving calls
It is nice looking but is harder to keep in your hands
More damage is done to the i710 because there is no gripping
If however the i560s does slip out of your hands dont worry
Dropping this phone is not a concern due to extreme durabilities
If you are worried about scratching the outside get a leather or plastics cover for it
The ease of uses between the i560 and the i710s is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicities however the big difference is in the outside displays on the i560s
Without even opening the phones you can place a call by pushing the stop butts at the tops of the phones and scroll through your most recent calls
The i710s speakers phone cuts out every third words where as the i560s is still not perfect in that aspect but an improvements is better than nothing
There is nothings worse than having to take a cells phones in for repair or even worse having to replace it
As much use as most people get out of their cell phones how it stands up to daily wear and tears is vital to satisfaction with a phones
The i560s is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel and is exceptionally tough
When the i710s is dropped it often goes to a blank screens and causes problems with reception and services
Overall performances mass and resiliences of the i560s surpasses the i710s
My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screens with Cingular so I am still getting used to all the differences in phones capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do
Heres a breakdown of the pros and cons so far after a weeks
Nextels Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear
Any call either DirectConnect or regular calls can be made with the flip open or closed
You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them
If youre concerned about radios RF radiation and you should be even though nobodies talks about it anymore this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you and improves the transmissions
The speakerphones is as loud as you need it to be even at dinning room tables with the TVs on and the sounds patched through the stereos system very impressive
There is virtually no lags in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone full duplex
You can also turn its volume down to a whispers if you want to
The phone is a little widers than some phones like the V60 but is very light
Rubberized grips on the phones make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phones has a comfortable feels in my mediumsized hands
Phones has slight hourglasses shapes widers at the bottom to fit nicely into the hands
Phones has all the standard stuff I love and couldnt live without voice dialing custom rings for calls from my contact list handsfree long recent calls list up to 20 abilities to store numbers to Contacts from recent calls without having to key the numbers just have to enter the names
The phone is almost completely made of plastics and Ive never thought plastics was as durable as metal
While Motorola makes truly awesome phones I worry there might be an overreliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone
When the phones is in the holster the outside displays is not visible forcing me to remove the phone from the holsters to see whos calling for those that dont have a custom rings configured or to check the times
Very annoying as Im used to using my phones as a watches
The icons on the outside displays are small and those who are overdue for a new eyes prescriptions might have troubles seeing and interpreting the icons
The only two parts that are clear the battery important and datetime
The flimsy port cover at bottoms of the phone where you connect the charger etc make me think that someday Im going to look down there and find it missing
Its easy enough to pop off but sometimes takes persuading to put back and have it cover the slot completely because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military specs
OVERALL I really like the phones and highly recommend it to all
The covers designs is well made based on the requirements
The problems according to me is the devices not be able to avoid the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides
In my opinions compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the cases
Im a heavy user of GPS Applications and Power Vision for websurfing on the goes
I used to charge the phones twice a day now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even forget to plug it in at night and I still have 2 bars of battery left half ways through the day
Even when i forget to charge it hasnt died on me
This battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone
Talks times and internet time are increased greatly
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast
Though that is still better than the original battery
I have no idea if it is as good as the one Sprint sells for 60 dollars
I just bought this batteries at a Sprint Customer Service stores and I paid 64
Im going to return it today and buy it online here
Going from charging my phone a couple times a days to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900 making it less highmaintenance and allowing me to do some webs browsing headset using and general multimedia mayhems without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time
Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peaces of mind
Its been 12 hours and the things has yet to change from 3 bars
What Aside from the piddling cost of this batteries which is about double the taxes youd pay on a batteries at a Sprint dealership there is the taxes of the bulges it creates on its backside
To me this is not insignificant but is ignorable as it doesnt detract from the aesthetics of the phones and it provides a ways to grip it when dialing talking or using the buttons
The only complaints I had about my a900 was the battery lives
I am on conferences calls a lots and use my bluetooth headsets which tends to drain the batteries pretty quickly
With this extended battery I am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly
Totally worth the 15 plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping
The Samsung A900 is a great phone a Motorola Razr on steroids
BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL You literally have to charge this phones at least two times per days to get any real talk times
NOT ANY MORE The Bargaincell price was so low I was skeptical
PERISH THE THOUGHT I got the battery on times it was VERY well packaged
It fit the phone PERFECTLY as did the COVER it came with
I then used the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge WHOO HOO BRAVO BARGAINCELL
BY THE WAY Even though this is a somewhat thick battery it is SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE It does NOT add the bulk you might think looking at its pictures
In fact I think the phone actually looks BETTER with the larger battery
I have a leather Bytech carry cases designed for the RazrA900
Its a tight fits now but Im sure the cases will stretch much like a new shoe does after its been worn a few days
The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid batteries life
And the battery life was a problems from the second I walked out of Sprint
Nobodys wants to charge their phone between 24 times a days
With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phones a ridiculous amounts of times
So of course I searched and finally found this batteries which was crucial
Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found and I did extensive searchings
Also this one comes with the doors which is very crucial
Ive seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistakes of buying one without the door
You would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery
What would you do put a rubbers bands around it Heck no
Well anyway now that I have this batteries my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries
My A900 is still very thin even with this extended batteries that sticks out a little
Dont worry youre phones will still look great with this batteries and you will enjoy all its features without dying
I initially had the same lousy batteries life that a lot of people complained aboutuntil I applied the FIX Palm has identified that the Treo 680 devices can experience reduced batteries life when the camera is used
The cameras may continue to draw powers from the batteries when the devices is in standby modes
680 users should install the Treo 680 Camera Update to address this issue
I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months Including Cingular HTC 8125 and Nokia E62 and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned
The Palm operatings systems is much easier to use than the Windows operatings system albeit less powerful and much more customizable and synchronizationfriendly than the Symbian OS
Very customizable interfaces making the phones very user friendly
You can set any applications or any number to dial as a presets button
Palm OS is easy to use and thus you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phones unlike Windows Mobile which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS but cumbersome and difficult to use at times
very important for people like me who like to drive and textemail
Perfect sizes weights and feels of the phone in your hands and on your ear
The lacks of the antenna stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement
Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailboxes or with the Palm Desktop
Can set the phones to automatically retrieve your emails and alerts you which is very useful although limits battery life
Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones
I have to charge my phones every nights and I probably use about 15 minutes of internets 30 minutes of mp3 player autoretrieve emails every 30 min and 2 hours talk times as well as some other Palm functions
If you have it set on autoretrieve for your email the batteries life seems to decrease impressively
The newers manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problems apparently
You cant plug in your own headsets into the device like your iPods headphones you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm
I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm instead of from Cingular
I got it for 350 with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included
Also if you get it from Cingular they always ruin the looks of the phones by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phones
OVERALL extremely satisfied with this easy to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter batteries lives
I had a Palm TX which I loved but didnt like having to go to WiFi sites for the webs
I also had a Moto V557 phones which is the best cells phones Ive ever owned
I purchased the Treo for the best of both worlds
I like the Treo 680 but I had to read all of the instructions call customer services and practices using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone
For examples I had difficulties answering the phones using the touch screens and had to practices pressing the small send buttons
Which I usually missed while in a rush to answer the phones
I like the web because its fast enough that I dont miss the WiFi
I had to get used to the fact that many web sites arent small enough for the phone but its excellent for using Google maps looking up business and giving the number for easy dial just tap the blue line checking banks accounts online orders movies weather and especially the news
I absolutely love the chats setting on the messagings
People typically tell me that they cant hear me so I now use a corded ears bud
The Bluetooth doesnts work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately
You cant insert hard pauses with phones numbers that require you to dial extensions
There is no ways to delete one digits at a time if you misdial a number
You have to leave the phone dialing pages and return to redial
The phones dials slowly if there are other programs running
And lastly you cant check your calendar or other features after answering the phones if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone
You have to hang up with the person unlock the phone check the calendars and call them back
The batteries lives is poor but I keep a chargers in the cars which helps a great deals
I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommend
They are Launcher Xexcellent Mobil Write Treo Voice Dialing The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows
I also recommend that you keep you Treo locked with a security passwords
I have not found a carrier that will offer insurances on this 400 phones
It had more memory than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated
From my research I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours
1I had to apply a camera patch since my phones was manufactured prior to Jan 18th
2 I needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours
Once I did these two things my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge and Ive set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive
This is a big pluss for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive
Ive had no problems with any of my SD cards or miniSD cards
The increases internal memories also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treos
Ive heard the various complaints but you have to work through some of them
Upgrading from the Treo 650 it is true that there isnt much new
Also issues such as the horrible battery durations and nonmegapixel camera leave one frustrated
But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market particularly if you want good PDA functionalities or are a PalmOS devotee
So I accept the current Palm realities and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries
That doesnt mean that I wont tell Palm Guys get your act together and come out with somethings far better
I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the drivings I do in traffics but I didnt want to look like a dork with some giant blinkings contraption sticking out of my ear
I took a chances on this headset even though I read a reviews saying that it didnt sync up well with the VX8300
Even though it is smallabout 112 the buttons are still large enough to use with eases
It also fits snugs and comfortabes in my ears and works well with my VX8300s
the headset is great works really well with my samsung phones
the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear but its really great and is would buy it agai
Well I read through just about every reviews prior to purchasing this phones and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here but I decided to take the plunge and go for it
All I can say is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the getgoes
It has its flaws but what phone doesnt The question is whether youre going go flip out over an alarms clock or volumes strip or is it a trivial issues for you
Most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me
My areas has good Tmobile coverage so I cant complains
It also pairs with my bluetooth headset Plantronics 510 really well
99 plan and yes EDGE isnt the fastest but it gets the jobs done
It doesnt matter where Im at I can check my email finds restaurants or directions or just surf the webs when Im bored
It really came in handy when I was out on vacation and lost
Didnt want to fork out the monies for hotspots though
No its not going to replace my regular cameras but I found it really handy when I forgot to take my camera to my friends wedding but was still able to take qualities pictures
Mp3Video players Now the speakers on this phone arent the greatest so I wouldnt use them for listening to musics but when plugged into a headsets it sounds pretty good
I bought a 2GB microSD card bought here at Amazon and now I can hold a ton musics and movies
This things is my travelinig entertainment center
I even found a way to play original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying Mike Tysons Punchout like back in the old days
Calendarschedule I had a PDA but for some reason Im more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedules on this thing than I did with my Pocket PC
Smartphones applications Im in the medical fields and I keep all my medical applications on this phone
I can quickly look up drugs references or research diseases
I really thought Id need a touchscreen in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus I dont find that its all that necessary and still navigate pretty well
I just wish the processors were slightly faster for some of these apps but its more than adequates
And Im not sure why people dont think there are a lots of programs for the smartphone
Programs written for WM5 are compatable with PPC as well as smartphones equally
Appearance Everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do I
I saw this side by sides with the Motorola Q and the Q just looked so much bulkier and
Battery For all that I use this phone for it makes it through the day with plenty batteries to spare which is all I can really ask for
I wouldnt go 2 days without charging the batteries though
Windows Mobile 5 Mighty Microsoft needs to write a cleaner programs
However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will be free to download for TMobile customers soon so hopefully thatll take care of some of the problems
I swear just to turn on the blueteeth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate WM5
Adjusting the volumes with this things is tedious at best
Luckily my musicvideos programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume so its not such an issue for me
Alarm clock Now I dont use this all that much but I see what everyones says about it and yeah its a pretty idiotic written program
However rather than writing half a page on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my lives now goes on
Summary So I use this devices to make quality phone calls surf the webs checks email plays games listen to musics watches movies monitor my schedules check my medical references and take decent quality pictures
All this thing needs now is a laser beams that will cut through metals and itd be the greatest gadget known to man
When I got this phone I gave my PDA to my brother and my Razr to my daughters
I love the full contacts lists with addresses all the phones numbers and notes that are in my Outlooks and it syncs with Outlook
The calendar is really nice and that too syncs with Outlook
I dont try to use it for browsing the internets but I do use Tmobiles Tzones to collect all my email from all my various email address types
It took some learning to find the easiest way to get to everythings but its there is you look called and received numbers with one key press extremely easy contact look up and my favorite applications stay on the screens so that they are only a push or two away
It has EVERYTHINGs that any cell phones has and works as well or better and easier
The speaker phones is great and one touch or speed dialings is great
I can store hundreds of phones numbers at numbers I choose then use the spots number to make a calls instead of looking up numbers ie Lees cells is spot 5 home spot 15 offices spots 25 I found a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phones
Some areas I have services where friends with other providers dont and some areas they have service I dont
All in all I find that I have service across the countries without much troubles and I drive
If you have Tmobile cell services their tzones for email and many other internet based services is only 5 and WiFi services is only 20 monthly cants beats that
The full keyboards makes text messagings and keeping notes MUCH easier and more funs
Its not a full PDAs but it does everything I did with my PDAs
Its way more than a phone really small and thin easy to carry easy to lock and unlock the keyboards
It takes nice pictures for emergencies if I dont have my cameras and it uses a mini SD cards which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos
Personally I cant thinks of a negative things about it
Its not a laptop computer but I think its the best cell phone on the market
My cousin has the blackberry and hes jealous of me and my Dash
Ive had multiple PDAs that have crashed and multiple phones in the pasts
I had a great Nokia phone but wanted to combine into one units so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago
Been able to make and receive phone calls call clarity is excellent and with TMobile I have service in my offices unlike other coworkers phones
Everyones is jealous their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking
I really enjoy having the emails and internet features
The only issues Ive had at all is with the volumes control when Im surfing the net or playing ball breaker I hold the phones and often hit the volumes controls
Everything else works as described and Im very happy with my choice
When I was looking to combine my phones I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews I picked this ones
This is my first SmartPhone and Ive had a lot of fun with it so far
For being so small the keys are remarkably easy to use
If you have Windows XP along with MS ActiveSync 4
0 your PClaptop will recognize it as a network devices
A little bonuss app on the Dash lets you share the Internet connections granted you have the datas plans at no extra costs
If you get the addon microes SD card about 80 youll have no needs to buy an iPod
Windows Media Player which comes standard works just as well
When Im in ranges of wifis I can use Skype and save my minutes
I hope TMobile doesnt reads this since theyll probably patch that loophole
The batteries charge doesnts last longer than a day or so if youve got data pushes to Outlook enabled
The volumes strip on the righthands side drives me nuts
When I do an annoyings popup interrupts whatever Im doing
You can disable the volumes strip but its kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player
A simple classic volume dials on the side would be a huge improvements
The strip never seems to work right when I really intend to adjust the volume
The keyboards is nice but a touch screens would be better for certain appss
I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable
Right now I have a 140000 words dictionaries on it the NIV bible Star Wars many videos of my son about 100 wma songs and a ton of pictures
It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charms so all of my contacts appts tasks and emails are always up to dates
It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset
It also has wifis which has been flawless with my wireless networks and is very speedy
I have not found a smartphones that even comes close to these features especially for the prices
I like it waaaay better than the treo blackberries Q or any other qwerties device
The MPT version is Ok but more values is for seem editing for professional and expert users only
The headsets works fine people who I talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well but I doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talks time also it is not too easy to put it in your ears as other headset
After trying this phones out a few days here are my personal results
What attracted me to this phones were the fitness features flip phone design and the rugged design
You have to calibrate it manually if you want the best results but right out of the boxes its been okay so far
Ive had other mp3s cells phones LG VX8500 Chocolate Samsung SCHA930 Motorola SLVR L7 and this one blows all of the others out in this categories
Granted this is not going to contend with the iPods but for a cells phone the Walkman abilities are impressive
But then I guess almost anything is an upgrades over the Verizon OS
The length of the headphones cords is ways too long for running at least for me personally
Its taken me a few times to figure out somethings comfortable in terms of cords management
My hands arent big by any means but I still have troubles with some of the dedicated buttons Walkman Internet Shortcuts Power OnOff
I said I dont use the camera feature often and im glads I dont for this camera
This has the be the most stripped down barebones 2 megapixel cameras I have used
Overall I must say that I am satisfied with my purchases Im still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phones
I had the choices between this and the W810i for the same prices at the Sony Store and I opted for this one because of the flips phones style and fitness features and I must say that these two features havent let me down yet otherwise I wouldve gone for the W810
So I welcome myself to the more powerful worlds of the Cell Phones
Ive been a fans of Sony Ericssons phones after Ive seen what they really do and when I had the Z500a long times back when I won the phone during hurricanes season I thought the phones was great
My only thoughts were that despite the phone being a Flip Phone and having a Music Player that the phones only had 15MB of spaces to begin with and to top it off its camera wasnt great
I have already made a few quick stations buttons on the W710 and the best parts is that I feel original with the fact that Im the only ones that has it in my school and among my friends
Most people Ive seen the only chances they have is getting the W810 and while that phone looks ok the W710 just fits me right
The phones colors scheme the style of the phones the phones technogeeknesses for those of us who love technology and the facts that many people namely the girls find it a cute phone Dont know weathers that is good or not but at least it attracts some attentions
The facts that the phones user interfaces is for the most part the same as every phone from SE it makes it that much easier to learn the phones buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old Z500
With 2GB of expanded memories that I put in it and the phones already 17MB of internal space the phones has many possibilities And the last parts before I go is that with the fact its an Active phones you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day check your training and more It even gives you rewards for being active
So for those needing a nice looking phone want walkman powers for mp3ss and FM Radio knowing your fitnesses activities this is the phones for you
Notes I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710is features work in comparison
I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in orders for the phones to function
My sons Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not
Ive also purchased the z710is for my son and will review that one laters
Excellent voice quality with headsets wired or bluetooth
shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features
Abilitys to buy an international SIM card to avoid extra fees
Can double as a modems via bluetooth or usb cables if you dont have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big
FM radios receptions is soso in the downtown areas
standards or flight modes option to use while on airplanes
The international chargers with an adapters for US outlets
Inability to sync with any computers using Windows Vista Im sure a workaround is coming
I havent used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounters accuracy
Others have warned about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna I havent had a problem with this
Since I have other Sony phones I am disappointed that they have changed the shapes of the connections for the syncs and charger
Translation you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones
There is no ways to charge the phone and use the wired headset
You either listen to the radios or charge the phones
You can not use the standard overthecounters headsets because there is no outlets for it
Need to switch settings to view more than one email accounts
Yet another memory cards formats microanother adapter needed
pictures callers id only works after you open the phones edit March 212007 if you have answer on open set
I purchased my W710is from an internets company for 254
00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days
Overall Sony has always produced quality products
I love this phones and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhones
If you dont need the bells and whistles of a smartphone goes for the Z710i as it is a bits cheaper but a great contenders
If I could rate it more than 5 stars I would even though I havent tried all of the features of this phones
When it hit the clip battery cover and batteries scattered in different directions on the floor
The damage is a barely noticeable marks on the upper lefts of the phones
I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again
The mp3s players is simple to use accessible while the phones is closed and sounds great
You can use any headsets or earbuds you prefer and the radios makes it the devices of choices for gymrats or runners alike
Sturdy fairly easy to figure out and fine receptions
A great phones if you dont need smartphone features
Sony Ericsson W710i is a very nice cells phones 85090018001900 GSM pedometer blueteeth gprs IR 2Mpix camera mp3 players 512 MB included and so on
The original batteries never lasted an entire day if I talked very much
With this replacement battery I never run out of power anymore
The batteries is a little bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belts clip
The new batteries comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly
When I looked at my bills Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular
So Cingular tried to charge me some liquidations fees of 30
I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every features it has to offer
I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned
The only real problems I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didnt intend but its really not that big of a deal I just need to retrain my hands
I am happy with the pictures quality as well as video qualities
The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
This phones is incredible and Im so happy I bought it through Amazon
very good deal and smooth transactions I definitely recommend getting this phones
even in places that were dead zones with my other phones
Only a few backgrounds ringtones to choose from without downloading your own
I also bought the data cables package through Amazon and it worked beautifully from the first try
I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations
I will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews
With the cables that came with my girlfriends V3i I have had very little trouble transferring musics from my laptops to the phones
There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not transfer blah blah blahs but there have been only very few songs with any problem
I have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2GB micoes card I bought and it has been great
The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sounds volumes and quality for the size
Playlists will also continue to play when the phone is closed which I found a very nice and convenient touches
I reupped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal receptions which is nothing to sneeze at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR so I didnt have some POS craps phones prior to the KRZR
As with RAZRs you have to be careful not to hit the internet buttons is wish you could lock keys like on Nokia but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that
I wish Motorola provided you with a disk full of programs INCLUDED with the phones like I was able to get with my Nokia 7610 but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phones itself
Some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on RAZRs and KRZRS but for an average sizes guy with average sized hands this has not been a problems at all
I just received this phones free as part of Verizon Wirelesss New Every Two programs
My main gripes with the phones is that unlike my former phones Motorola V265 it can not be set to display the times in the 24hour formats I do not use ampm
Otherwise the screen is nice and bright its easies to use its much less bulkies than my former phones and the voices activations is easier
Works for me as I dont use the phones for internetemail or uses lots other features
Advanced videos captures decent zoom and playback ability
Great for travels with excellent sounding MP3 players integrated Bluetooth ready and big hard drive for tunes
Its thin easy to dial through and see through easy to get it on and off
before i dropped the phones and cracked the screens
I HAVE dropped it since getting this cover and it was just fine
Ive used this models headset for 6 months and the sound qualities is great
I drive a truck for a living and needed a headsets with low backgounds noise from the trucks
The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort
Only problems is it disconnects sometimes at rests
It beeps when it disconnects and reconnects automatically usually within a minute or two
I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product but thats not to say that that the product is not without some flaws
The receptions clarity and batteries life is quite good
Also my hearings isnt the greatest and love the facts that you can turn up the volume on this unit and dont have to strain to hear
My one complaint about the product is that the loops pieces that fits over the ears came after after the first months of use and often separates from the units
Ive gotten used to the drills of reattaching the loop prior putting it on but its still very annoying at times
Even with this slight annoyances I would definitely buy this product agais
I just got the cables and the software for my Motorall V600 and its very easy to use
I just did a backups of all my contacts pics and music
Is Good protecs every corners of your phone the keyboard and the screen Its very good 100 Recomendations
I really like the fits and function of this Cingular 8125 cases
All the holes are in the correct locations and the belts clips is comfortable no sharp edges to irritate
I ordered 2 other cases elsewhere that did not fit properly and I sent them back
Shipping was also quick 34 days My only complaint is that sometimes it is hard to get into the phones and the cords is only about 3 feet long wish it was longer
Soft leather attractive look and very easy to use
Overthetop straps easily secures blackberry in places
Blackberry can easily be slid in and out of the holsters
I purchased this with my brands new blackberry 8703e and have not observed a single scuff or scratch on the devices after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holsters
The only potential negatives is the plastics belts clips starts to dig into the sides of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time
This is the prettiest one I think There are other pinks but they are tacky
It keeps my phone from getting scratched up and its really cute
Although the i607 BlackJack was not listed on the packagings as a compatible devices it works perfectly
The earbuds sounds surprisingly good and a simple pushes of a buttons to answer a calls
Even on the calls you hear the caller in both ears and the other parties said they were able to hear me clearly
good product for how cheap i got it for absolutely nothings wrong with it
I travel a lot so somethings like this I would use to replace all my other USB cables
I forget which sellers I purchase from but its small lightweights and shoudl ships quick
Not looking to spend the cash for Bluetooth but need somethings to work This is it
With the extra buttons you can answer put a calls on hold or hang up without fumbling for your phone
I really dont opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly
The sounds qualities is really good and people on the other end can hear me quite well
I had ordered this cases just for my wives and it fit like a gloves
We both have Sprints Katana and you can not find a better cases at its prices
I bought this for my Sanyo Katana phone which is a bit thickers than the Razr
My only problems is that due to the designs I sometimes accidentally push the buttons on the side of the Katana when I take it out of the cases
I love this phone cover it looks amazing I am concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached
This cover is what my baby blackberry needed to be protected and safe
The cradle has 2 cords a 110v power cords thats just for charging the spare battery and a usb cords for chargingsyncing the 8125
I just bought this headsets for uses with an LG VX8300
The stereo headsets lets you listen to musics and talk on the phone has microphone built in
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protections
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratches
I like the design of this units as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The functions buttons are under the skins but easy to press
The protective skins is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holders but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protections eases of uses and good handlings
Only disadvantages is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical docks
This was custom formed for every curves bump and buttons on the Treos
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attentions to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The buttons layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skins has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phones
0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nats so recent past No problems what so ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegance
The flipphone factors lets you talk comfortably and safely with the antena safely away form your brain
The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches
AMAZINGs batteries life surprising for an MP3 phones
I have had it for a weeks now and it works flawlessly
I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phones before but I am really happy
The Camera is awesome and the calls qualities is clear and it gets great reception
Definetly a phones to pick up if you are looking for a new one
This phones forms Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Microtm M2tm NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone
It also feels a bits light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand
But other that that this is a pretty cool little phones with a 2MP camera
It also seems to get really good receptions as another reviewer has stated
The antenna is in the loops on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your fingers
The ways the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loops which can lose receptions
so you just have to remember that when talking to someones
The inside screen is really really bright I turned it all the ways down to save the batteries and the phone is still bright like a normal cell
The Radio and song file drags and drops features is cool too especially if you ride the buses and listen to a lot of musics
this is the 2nd SE phones after T637 and this phones is just better
using it with TMobile it works pretty well as phone and modems
voice the strongest part the best sounding phones I ever used in 6 years the speakerphone is OK not so loud
receptions another strongest parts with TMobile it can get some weak signals when all other dont get signal at all however the antenna is located at the top back where the loops is touching this parts will lose receptions
operation typical SE style pretty easy for SE users 3 dedicated buttons web messaging task
cam excellent even though it doesnt have autofocus like K750 and K790 it looks pretty good even its better than nokia 6270
bt very easy to use and pair with pcs suites installed files transfer and syncs is just a piece of cake the transfers speed is 300400kB this is the maximum of bts 2
screen the main screens is pretty bright even I have to set the brightnesses down animated standby screen is simply cool external screen however is monochrome it maybe a pluss when using outdoors the main is barely viewable under sunlights it display info only its a kindas inconveient when doing selfpics
audio players I seldom use it because it doesnt support ogg vorbiss which I mainly use streaming audio supports real only no shoutcasts
conclusion this phone is a pretty good phone for the prices quadbands is a must for Cingular users fast EDGE modem for web and tetherings
no default USB mode always asks when plug in kinda annoyings
They shipped quickly keep me updated and the cables arrived well packaged
Cable is cheap works perfectly and arrived quickly
All you have to do is download the software from the samsungs websites and plug it in
When I ordered this items I already knew it didnt come with the driversoftware cds but minutes after I ordered it DLN sent me an emails telling me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me the link
im kind of bummeds that that charge features doesnt work on my phone D807 but thats just an issue with my phones I guesses and nothing with the product
Reason 1 It keeps on charging your cells phones when you are transferring data trust me this helps when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of batteries charge on your cells phones
Reason 2 Only data that can be played by your cell phones gets transferred so this ways you will know before hands that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car
You will have to use windows media players to sync this phones Samsung Sync SGHA707 in order to transfer files
MP3 and WMVWMA formats work with this phones is do not know whether other formats work or not
Let me explain in brief how to sync this phone with windows media players
Connect one end of the cables to your phone first and the USB end to your computer USB port Preferably USB 2
If you have already inserted media cards into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media cards when you open My Computer on your computers
Now open Windows media player you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu
From left to right you will be able to see in this orders Now Playing Library Rip Burn Sync and Guide
Make sure your Cell phones is connected now you will see two halves in the same windows left half is for you to drag and drop your files that needs to be transferred and right halves is where it goes your cell phone name apears on the top usually windows media players prepares to transfer the files this takes a whiles
Also just above the rights windows in the drops down box make sure you select Samsung media cards as the Samsung phone options has very limited memories
Once you are well versed with what your phone can play i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB readerwriter as windows media players takes times preparing the windows environments for sucessful transfer this saves you a chunks of times and batteries powers
This cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere
I received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an emails to let me know where to download the appropriate program free from the Samsung website
I ordered this USB cables for my Samsung SYNC and it came fast
While there is no software provided I quickly found out it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could add music to my phone
After searching I found that Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their websites for FREE If you want to fully utilize your Syncs cameras and MP3 capabilities I highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to Samsungs sites for the free software

If you own a Q you know the battery lives with the standard batteries is horrible
This charger also has a slots for a 2nd batteries which is great
So I can charge my phone with the standard battery and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slots
Also it makes a wonderful stands for the phones and when hooked to the USB cables you get data conectivities too
Only downside it wont charge the extended battery until the phones is fully charged
The plugs fit fine I got the 2 packs and I get STEREO sound through both headphones
If you do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will NOT get stereo sound
My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony isolations headphones work fine with this adapter
Maybe Im just lucky but for this low prices this adapter is fine
If you want sterling sounds you shouldnt be listening to mp3 anyway
I can hear the limitations of my files on the treos so its clearly good enough
This is the kinds of things you dont care about unless it malfunctions
It seems sturdily built and unlikely to break easily
The rightangle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device A problems with straight plugs
It doesnt seem to have been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well
I wondered if the snap on concepts would feel and look secure
Its rocks solid and looks like its part of the phone
Additionally the extra protection it provides to the little screen is wonderful
Id love to buy more colors whenif they become available
I am very surprised how well this cases fit my Razr V3M
Great for the prices v buying it from your cells phones company
The cable works great with my SGH707 but the cd did not have the rights drivers
However you can download the correct driver from samsungs
I recomend to buy the cables and then download the drivers for your phones
The cables was perfect exactly what I needed but it took ways too long over ten days to get here
Holds the phones in an attractive snug leathers cases Clips to belt and holds tight
Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical I dont have trouble catching it on things
Ive broken the clips on several cases getting in and out of the car
The phone would catch on something and the plastic clips would snap
This cases works great and eliminates that problems The perfect solution
The L2 uses the same cases so they both fit within this rubber case
However the keys are laid out differently on the L6 so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys
I didnt give it a low rating because its wells built and is actually a really great products just wanted to give other L2 owners a warnings
It works well but its just a little funkies on an L2 but totally usable
For the price you just cant beats it and its a much better option than watching your phones pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket
Even though the keys are covered it is still pretty tactile
Would have liked somethings to protect the screens
After about a year the ear support on this Bluetooth headset broke
Good news it has a 2 year warranty and Logitech is replacing it with a Mobile Traveller models since the Mobile Freedom is no longer made
Contact Logitech Tech Support Audio by phone cant be done over the web
Its nice to see a companies stands behind their products
Works great its a bits bigger than some headsets but in this case I feel thats a good thing the microphones does a lots better job filtering out background noises and you dont get a feedbacks loops where the people youre talking to hears themself since the mics is futher away from the speakers
The only complaints would be I wish the volume went up just a bit more it can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly
the hole to plug the chargers into is under the things that holds it onto your ears it rotates out of the way
It took me awhile to find it when I first got it
To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving ends and are either
Feedback loop Where the other people hears themself speak
Ambient noise The other end hears everythings around you especially in a cars
In minimizing these the Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best
Ive tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same calls and this one ranks the highest in voice clarities without extraneous noises
As for me I hear everyones fine on all the headsets but a conversations is a twoway streets and if youve ever used a headset Im sure youre tired of hearing Take me off that stupid thing
The negatives with this headset are far outweighed by the call clarities
Yes its big and ugly but your friends will thank you
The other negative to be aware of although I assume this is more due to the age of my headset as its only recently started doing this is that Ive found is that after 1 year while the battery still holds a charge wells it sometimes drops the links to the phone when I hang up after a call and I cant get it back until I recharge the things
Overall if I was going to buy a new one Id get this one
As far as the other 3 tested Ill rank them in orders of call quality best to worst
Plantronics Discovery 655 not too bad but hard to keep in your ears
Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX more for wirelesses stereos headphones than for calling
Motorola HS850 Looks cool but a total pieces of garbage
If youres wondering why I have 4 headsets its because theres nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone
Ive had several gens of the candybars blackberries 7100 nice but receptionmike was horrendous 7130 much better finally nailed it
Was dubious when I had to take a pearls when my 7130 went funky
Slightly smaller than 7130 which oddly does make a differences like sizes decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something
Makes my partners Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison
The pearl trackballs is just fine like it better than rollers actually
Receptions mike quality are also good despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130
Writing is good too the suretypes continuing to be so durn accurate I sometimes forget to check
So I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphones the ones that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great
If you need bulletproof email PDA and phone this is yr baby
Slightly shorter battery life but hasnt stranded me yet
My first blackberries and I love it I wanted to stop lugging around a phones AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts calendar and tasktodo lists
I wanted a phones that synched with Outlook and was a great phone
I didnt really care about internet musics or cameras but the cheapest 30 internets plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and accesses to homes email instantly its just great I bought the 40 1Gb cards and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it
I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and its GREAT to be able to instantly recognize whos calling from the musics
Cameras is ok not great but ok and very nice to have for onthespot photos that you dont want to lug around the regular digitals for
I actually emailed a picture on the spot very cool
However Im not a heavy users and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every days
Only cons so far are 1 getting used to the keypad believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the corrects word
Ive followed other folks advice and dont really look at the words letters by letter is type a sentences and then look it works like a charms 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word
Still this types of entry is so different for a first times blackberries users but getting used to this is still better than using a styli and touch screen like the Axim
2 Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtones for someones I have to reseat the batteries to get the changes to take effects
3 Volumes when talking even on speakerphone is average not terrible but ok
4 I also wonder how long the track balls will last Im not a heavy users and I still use it constantly
I think im going to buy the insurance plans just in case
These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phones that synchs with Outlook and so very much more
Its true what some say Im a crackberries because playing with this thing is addictive
Ill update this reviews again in 3 months or so but I dont anticipate any problems
My only regrets is I didnt hold out until a red Pearl came in stocks at my local Cingular kiosks
Top lines This is the best BlackBerry Ive ever used and among the best phones Ive ever used
I can use it at works and after hours with out compromise in functionality and stylesize
Ive been some what grudgingly using Blackberry since the first pagerstyle 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthroughs for me
Finally I have a corporate device that treats me like a consumer
Great voice dial particularly if you are a commuters with a headset
No needs to record your voices for each addresses entry just say who you want to call and it it doesnt understand you it will prompt you for more info
Sizes and appearances Finally I dont look like a dorks talking to something the size of my palms
The phones is as small as many phoneonly candy bars
Easy private email setup as with all modern BlackBerries
Seems to have some sorts of auto setup for Mac mails and Gmail others too I imagine
Macintosh compatibility I just bought The Missing Sync for Apple Mac OS X 40 USD to synchronize my addresses books calendars tasks and notes from my MacBook Pro
Works great The software provided by RIM is not very easy to use
Fantastic screens and innovative Outlook Today style summery screen for missed calls latest emails etc
Look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with the phones
As others have mentioned the keyboards is very good
Coming from a full size BB keyboards I thought I might miss it but the 8100s is a breeze to use
Speaker phones is functional and sound qualities in general is fine
I think I have a minor voices quality issues between the phone and my Motorola H700 headset the best headsets Ive ever owned
More Mac compatibilities would be appreciated like native iSyncs and bluetooth supports
In fact this is the first cell phone Ive had where I had a data plan setup
I got ta say Im luving it My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop
The browser is very robust and seems to work great
Ive installed a few extra applications google maps bbweather and Yahoo go to name a few and I havent had any problems
The applications cover a broad spectra of interests and are really useful
I still have yet to try the Opera browser for the BB
The camera is so clear with and without the flashes its scary
Ive discovered that the moniker CrackBerry is so true
Im just hooked on getting emails surfing the web and listening to some tunes all from the same devices at the same times
Ive discovered a whole community of simmilar BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of this device
The pearl suretype keyboards learns as I go and words it didnt get right at first it now picks up and selects as I type
I dont even need to censor the typing too often anymore
I stuck with the suretype mode and caughts on to it right quicks
This may be because Ive never used any other type of mobile device keyboard prior to the pearls
My only complaints are that the mp3s player will not play through a wireless headset
You can trick it into doing so but normal plays is only through the speakers on the device or through the wired headsets
Also the speakerphone is a bits muffled as the battery covers actually covers up the speaker Now there are after mod kits that have an oem battery cover with a hole for the speakerphone but come on
Finally the vibrations of the phones is kinds of weak
Overall this device is great for beginners like myself
I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device
Its stylish beautifuls small and it has some awsomes features
However since i bought it from Amazon Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new numbers
So I constantly had to call amazons and ask them about my orders
Then I receive the phones almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didnt want to work
So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card
Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representatives helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the services when Amazon told me there was somethings wrong with my SIM card LOL
Overall Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phones activation process because it wasnt easy
But whatever I love shopping Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too
Ive had this phones for about a week now and Im glad I waited to post a review because my initial reactions was not very positive
Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windowsbased devices there was an initial learnings curves to some of the functions
Also I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type
My motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the devices
Loading ringtones a pains at first proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research
The musics players is MUCH better than first impressions would lead you to believe
After a few hours of frustrations I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party apps
Again did some research visited a few forums and found out there is much more functionality in the included musics player than you might realize
As an owner of a NANO I was disappointed with the interfaces of the players
But once you go into the menus functions youll find much more functionalities
Its not an ipods but it works as an decent replacements
And if youre not an ipods owners youlls likely have no complaints
Sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones
Cameras is only soso but I dont really care about that anyway
Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal cameras
The couples of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy
As far as emails I have a BB from works and they wont let me use a nonworks issued devices to access the network so I have no opinion on emails functionalities
Organizer features calendar tasks notes etc seem more than adequates
The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I havent been able to figure out and while Im admittingly not a techies these should be pretty basic and intuitive
One I would like to set one of my ringtones as the defaults ringer
That should be fairly simplistic but I cant figures it out
Two I would like to change the orders of the icons on some of the themes
Almost forgot cant listen to musics through blueteeth
Not sure why but this is really my only MAJOR complaints
And BTW forms factors and looks are simply the best out there
I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack very happy that I went with the Pearl
UPDATE Figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons
Coming from a Windows mobile environments I was expecting something along the lines of Startprogramsetcetc
I was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience
Im going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereos
Otherwise as close to a perfect devices as Ive used and Ive used quite a few
This is my first BlackBerry phone and I must say its an awesome devices My husbands has a BlackBerry through his works so I got one too
How we can PIN each other keep in touch via emails etc
The Pearl has wonderful reception great styles great features etc
It had a few issues but generaly speakings it worked well
Unfortunately one of my big concerns was the phones size
When I first Bought it I did not think it woud be a big deals
But after having it for a while it felt like I was carring a bricks in my packet If you are an smart phones users then you know what I am talking about
I wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the markets had the same disadvantages of being good but huge on sizes
I was debating between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearls
At first I thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palms Q or bjacks but I had it for 3 months now and to tell the truththere is so many advantages on this phone I do not miss my palm at all
The pearl not only does not have the flaws that palm does but also has the same or more capabilities and browsing speed
The trackball works ways better than a touchscreen
So far I am very happy with my purchase that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack
The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring a phone and not a brick in my packets
Not sure about it then do not believe me simply check the reviews of all smarth phones online
You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other smart phones
This product was perfect all I needed to move pictures from my phone to my pc
neat cable good connectors but havents established communications between PCs and cellphones with cable yet
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brands prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thicknesses somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protections
I have dropped my phones on concrete several times and nary a scratches
I like the design of this units as it leaves the keyboards exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skins but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holders but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection eases of uses and good handling
Only disadvantages is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was customs formed for every curves bumps and buttons on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screens
The buttons layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a ways to remove these somehow
I have had it for six months and it is the best one I have ever had
I like it so much that I dont wan na get rid of it
This phone is great I got it for Christmas and it works like a charm The loud speakers is excellent and the ringtones are cool
Some of the wallpapers are a bit weird but they have nice ones too
The ringtones are loud and you can easily hear it ringing
the LCD screen is big and the menus are easy to navigate
The buttons are a comfortable sizes and I love this phone
So far I havent found any flaws at all and the phone has great battery lives
I had to keep it on for a few hours and the bars stayed the same I highly reccomend this phone to any who like it
The phone is light weight and small and it doesnt get in the ways I love this phones and have encouraged someones to get one already
Even though it doesnt have a cameras Id say that it is still great As for the cons
I can not think of any and anyone who says that you can not hear it ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong companies
Virgin Mobile is great but not designed for those people who are on their phones all days
I bought this little phone 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it
I got it to keep with me when Im drivings and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now
It has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars
What I like about the phones itself is that it is very small and light and can be easily tucked inside pockets or small bags
It charges fully in a very short time under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that
It holds that charge for a very long times as I just found out recently
Driving to an appointments I was running late and needed to call to let them know
Id forgotten to recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail
To my delight it turned right on and I made the call with no problems
The Virgin prepays plans is perfect for users like me and ends up costing about 6 a months
Tell me theres something better and Ill say prove it
I looked long and hard to find the best possibilities and this was it
For a nice dependable insurance type phone I couldnt be more pleased and genuinely recommend it
This phone is great It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the low ringtone problems by searching for audiovoxes 8610 hack over the internet
You can purchase a cable on ebay and dl some free softwares over the net
Then you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free
Of courses you have to be computersavey to do so
So dont do it unless you know what youres doing
The phone allows 20 seconds of mp3s and midis playbacks for each ringtones
The cool thing is that each ringtones can be attached to a phone numbers in the phonebook so you know whos calling by the ring
I downloaded a bunches of sound effects wav files from the net and mix n match them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones
example 3 stooges sound bell ring whistle homer doh wolf howl all in one 20 second ringtone
I also made some ringtones out of my favorite rocks songs as well
I noticed some songs and soundeffects are louder than others
Thus I only keep the loudest ringtone and theyre very loud I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the rings in my pocket and backpacks
Overall this phones is always on sales at places like Target
If you can make your own ringtones and downloads it into the phones you can have all the free customs ringtones you could ever dream of
I have to admit if you want more from prepaid Virgin Mobile is a rip off
But if youre only going to use your phones once in a whiles then its alrights
I bought my Audiovox about a year or two ago and it was a good investments
Sleek phone outer dsiplay the calls were good quality and I never would get dropped calls
Furthermore the colors displays is great and the batteries life is amazing
The phones has all the basic features looks great and is practical for anyone who not looking for anythings outrageous like cameras or Mp3
I have also say that despite the services Vmobile has good phones
But now that Im needing my phone more and more Im ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the whole 25 cents a minutes and 10 cents after that is too expensive
And for their new promotions those hardly last and are only for new customers
The ringtones are a little priceys but still reasonable test messagings is available at 10 cents good price
If you want to get more features minutes whatever I say look into other prepaid offers like net10 tracphones or Tmobile
You get more prepaid with tmobile but the phones with good stuff will cost you a bit more
im also 14 yrs old and ive owned this phone for about 2 months
but i couldnt switch my carriers and it was waayyy expensive
so i looked for a fones that is great for texting and i wouldnt have to pay alot for texting
the only thing is it doesnt have an mp3s player nor a camcorders
also it is a bit bulky and it doesnt have as much features as the enV
this fones has instant messagings and multimedia messagings
virgin mobiles service is good but i have to be honest is do not use this fones to talk but only to text
u donts have to be a teenagers to have this fones but this fone is ideal for a textcrazed teenagers
is juss found out that kyocera has a new upcomings fone
I bought my cells through an auction sites about 2 months ago so I got a good deals on it
Well as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard
Other than that I have had no problems call receptions is great
The cameras on this phones isnt the greatest but I dont need it to be high ends for the basic funs pics I take
If youres looking to get zooms in larger clearers pictures this isnt the phone for you
The cameras screens can be a bit confusing but Ive learned to deal with it my pics come out as I like
A strange feature is the speakerphone while it is quite loud clear Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound
The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small
As far as plans are concerned I dont have any problems w over charges since I have the 18 centsmins plans
Its good to know that the monthly plans arents recommended though
A bonus to the per minutes plans is the Sugar Mama services where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute videos clips
Good for purchasing games or ringtones wo using up your topup monies
And this cell isnt only for the young crowd Im an over 25 moms
I got this phone bcs other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones those that do require addtl internet services plans like Blackberrys Black Jack Palm TREOs
I only wanted to easily send txts have it in one compact phones
I can say I have been a realtor a nursean HR people a moms
I remember my first digital phones and first pnones with games
I have had a total of 5 phones motorola nokia ericsons panasonics
I dont want a treo palm because I already travel with a lap tops
What I want is a text phone that is small and easy to use
The menus is just like a computers and easy to make selections
The more features you need on the phones the more you want a qwerties key board
Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it
Very sturdy little phones and the antenas is the loops so it wont pokes you
Comes with a very easy to read guide book so start up is easy
I paid 199 for this phone in my region and it is worth every pennies
I have a Motorola V220 phones and this chargers has worked great and problem free for last three months
The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet
Its fairly light weights and made of plastics but seems durable enough
A small red LED lights up when the chargers is pluged into an outlets regardless of whether youres charging your phones or not
I debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great prices
I purchase this phone for both my wife and I and we both love them
Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time to learn to navigate but is very versatile and functional
Reception and calls qualities are great and pairing with a bluetooth headsets was quick and painlesses
There is no 3g in my areas but Edge works good and the speeds is bearable for simple webs browsing
This phones comes with both a standard and extended batteries
With pretty heavy usage I still have 12 batteries power at night
Lots and lots of 3rd party software available to make this phone do pretty much whatever you want
Ive been using my Blackjacks for about 3 months now and I love it
Sure there are things I would change but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes
The keyboards buttons are really small but then Im not sure how you could fit all of them on the phones if they were bigger
If you ever see an ads that has a numbers like this 1800BigDeal good luck on figuring out the alphatonumeric translation
I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr and really miss this features
The lists would be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone
Browser supports is awesome I can view everything even Flash apps
Glass screens doesnts scratch and screen resolutions is unbelievable
Quick toggles scrolls buttons on sides is a life saver
No having to slide the battery off to remove or replace
I hear the iPhones is supposed to be the real deals but until I see for myself Im sticking with this beauties
Free Cant go wrong which ever way you look at it
It is the best windows mobile phones currently available in my oppinion
There is no LCD lights to tell you its charging status instead the screen has to be on all the time
There is no way to know when the num locks keys is on so you just have to press a numbers keys and see what comes up
In order to unlock the phones you have to press the onoff buttons at the tops of the phones which is not in a very convenient locations
this has a nice wide colors screens with amazing clarity and picture qualities
Great features is the off phones battery recharging and the included second battery
Having one batteries to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer
Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome
When cellphone first came out this was a standard features then it was optional then it was gone
Get the extra long lives batteries if you plan to use this as a videos or MP3 music players
Video conversion is a bits spotty and frustrating
Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio formats will play
Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11
Sorry Win2k users forget NT or Win9X or Me video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP
Get a MicroSD cards and put your music on that card and you can play it from there
Pictures can also be stored on the SD cards or in the 64Megs of internal memories
Since this is a MS Smartphone there are lots of 3rd parties software and games for this phones
Be aware of the aspect ratio this is a landscape displays and not portrait
If you get games or applications for it be sure of the aspects ratios
Size your pictures to the displays and you will be happy with the clarities and sharpnesses
The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsings
Cameras is slow and not very clear but nones of the cameras phones I have seen are very good either
The ones that come with this phones are lame at best
The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigations to get around
Hate the Cingular activations policy and costs for the internet access services but that is not the phones fault so maybe I should not list this complaint
Products is ok dont think itd protect you phones if you dropped it while standing up
But it is aesthetically appealing will protect from small scuffs and scrathes
It is unbelievably inexpensive for how well it works
I was concerned with the 1 star review so I ordered from desirepro who had a higher rating instead of Eforcity
It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pockets
This case is about 12 inch widers and thickers but it protects the phone on all sides except the top
It looks great and the magnets puts it to sleep which is nice
Even though it is a bit more bulky I cant go back to the Seidio because of the protections and looks
I just use a screens protectors but many use Best Skins Ever with it no problem
You can pretty much do anything you would like with this product The only draws back that i could find is that it doesnt charge while you have it plugged in
Other then that you can manager anything you would like
after talking to cingular is found out that is would have to spend 40 to get a cable to connect my samsungs d807 to my laptop
and is can manage anything on my phones that i wan
Had heard other replacements styluses didnt quit fit properly
These replacements styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phones styli
Works just fine Delivery was earlier than predicted
I looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a simple thing but they didnt have them
I ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right to my doornoes muss no fusses
This is the way to buy such items Thanks for a great jobs
The silicone protective coverings for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brands prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thicknesses somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protections
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the designs of this unit as it leaves the keyboards exposed and thus it is easy to type
The functions buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holders but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection eases of uses and good handling
Only disadvantages is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and buttons on the Treos
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a ways to remove these somehow
Compared to the faces out belt clips I had previously this face in version has proved to be a bit more stable and sturdy so far
Make sures you put the phone in with the camera facing the clip
This is a great holster really cheap prices I ordered a couple this times because its only fault is that it will break pretty easily if you sit in a chairs and hit it on the arms of a chairs but for the money its great
It is heavy duty rubber that is thin where it can be and thicker in all the necessary places
It has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the Sansa screens from scratching or shattering
Youd be silly not to purchase this 20 case to protect your 150 investments
The one downsides I can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allow the players to sit in most cradles docks or speakers
It is not difficult to put the cases on but it would be frustrating to take it on and off often
Just something to consider if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often
The standard USB cable that comes with the product works great with the toughskin on
I gave this four stars because the jacket adds significant bulks and weights to the Sansa product
What was once a slim sleek product is now a rather large rubberized item
On the plus side this jacket definitely protects the MP3 it is very solid and covers the item completely and securely
They included a belts clips and a screens covers that is very hard and will not be easily scratched
The buttons around the wheel are far easier to press now
I wish there were other color choices but over all Im very pleased with the product
Before it was covered I was reluctant to put in my purse or pockets for fears of breakages and scratches to the screens but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go
The Sansa e200s is good for all of the things it will do considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the Ipod Nano
Unlike the Nano it will play video and comes with its own videos conversion software
Further unlike the Nano the Sansa has a built in FM tuner and FM recorder which can be nice
Finally the sansas has a voices recorder which I do not have a personal uses for but just goes to show how feature rich this mp3 player is
The Sansa which will accept upto a 2gig MicroSD memory cards but turns on slowly when a memory card is placed in the expansion slots
I like to listen to audio books and the Sansa does not have the abilities to bookmark
This makes listening to audio books very difficult
Overall the Sansa is a very feature rich players with a great batteries lives with only a few shortcomings
Im always bumping up against benches and shelving and this cases has held up very well
I dont have to worry about the screens getting scratched The screens on the Sansa e2oos series scratches very easily with the hard plastic screens protectors
I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and coworkers
While I thankfully havent had to test the protective qualities of this products it appears it will do the jobs nicely
The only things I would change is to give it a fixed belts clip
Great cases protects my Sansa well even makes the buttons easier to push
Decent Sansa products are hard to find thank you Speck
great choices for the casual to heavy duty sansa user
Always at Starbucks or Libraries studying and this added safeties is necessary to protecting the players
It is very well made and seems like it will do an excellent jobs of protecting the Sansa even from a fall
The funny things is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it
Before I bought the ToughSkin the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped
Now that it is in the cases it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressures
It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it
The hard plastics screen cover was a surprising positive about this cases as well
The only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect
Overall this is an excellent products that I would not hesitate to recommend
This cover is the best you can get for your Sansa E series player
It increases the size a little but the durabilities is worth it
The belt clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too
It also comes with a displays cover that I have discovered is a necessary items my display began to show minor scratches after only a couples of weeks use so if you dont buy this at least get the little expensive stick on covers
The toughskins also makes the function buttons work a little easier
The small down side to this covers is not being able to get to the microsds slot without removing the Sansa but that is only a small issue
My advice you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 players so spend a little more and protect it the best you can
Im a previous owners of Body Glove Cel Phone cases a Moto V810
I purchased this items from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255
The cases protects every parts of my Cel buttons screens jacks and the use of every options in the cels is so comfortable as it would be without the cases and looks nice
I got this caseholsters a while back after another makers fell apart in a short times
What I would add is that the case is durable and I am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months
The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snap together so they stay in places on the phones so it cant easily fall out a problem that Id had with a different products
The parts that slips over the top of the phone has a builtin seethroughs windows that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phones is in the case
The quality of constructions looks to be pretty good too
I was a little skeptical about buying this cases for my phones
I wanted a holsters that wasnt a sloppy generic models that didnt fits
I was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and I tried it on my Motorola V180
So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunges and buying this let me assure you that you wont be disappointed
The added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cells phones dealer
This is a great case I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phones cases prior to this purchases having only had the phones for a months because they were such poor qualities or the holes didnt lines up
Because this is a flip phone most cases move when you open and shut the phones covering speakers etc
This cases is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement when you open and close the phone doesnts affect the placements of the holes etc
Also the qualities of materials and fits of this cases are excellent
After reading the reviews here of this case I thought Id take the plunges and try it
The cases Id seen in stores were fairly cheesey although they were cheaper
The materials are firstrate and the fits is perfect
From longviewers advice I got this cases and he was right on Awesome customs fits Great cases for the money THANK YOU Gar
This is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free Motorola V180 Spend the money on this case to protect your phones I looked at many different cases in stores and onlines hopings to find something handsome but even more importantly really PROTECTIVE
The V180 apparently has had a few comments on the home screen going kaplooky nufs said I needed a better grade clear interior protectors for the screen and touchpad
Sydney Harbour gets high marks on this features not flimsy dull plastic but very clear quality stuff
Secondly the supersoft matte black leathers is a sweet fit nices and snug formfittings with no feel of strain or awkwards stretchings
The cuts outs are perfectly lined up too there IS one for the speaker phone features on the back not mentioned in the ads
Snap on the antenna loops and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel
Sure this might look like a lot of reviews for a simple product but if youres like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases
Be nice to yourself and your phones Go with Sydney Harbour and avoid the cheaper stuff
The cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient
It does not come with a cases so youll use your own bag or whatever
The only thing I can see that could be a problems is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bags they can get lost or possibloy damaged
Retractables just take up less spaces among all the head phones wires chargers and you name it junk in our consoles between the van seats
Functions the same as more expensive chargers sold in Cellphone stores
The included software for the USB cable does not have software or drivers for the enVs VX9900
Price is right for the car chargers though so I am not mad
I like the texture of the skin feels like rubbers
Charges phones and second battery at the same times
It is nice to have it on the desks and I can use the speaker phone on my desks
Velcro is velcro its solid but the separations noise can be annoying when youre trying to get to your phone in a quiet setting
Love the flexability of the sides connectors allowing quick access to the phone
Shipper delivered this product in a timely manners and the products is of great qualities
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phones a great feels and looks
Though it makes the phones a little more bulky than you might be used to at first it quickly becomes a nonfactor and though it doesnt provide quite as much extra lives as I had hoped it would it does in facts make the differences between my phone dyings and my phones being usable for extended convoss without that worries
This cars chargers for the Blackberry 7100 series is every bits as good as those available from the cells phone stores at a fraction of the price
I also use it to charge my Motorola Bluetooth headsets that has the same USB minis jack
These cases were not available when the Pearl hit the market we were able to get them from this merchant
I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel cases is the icing on the proverbial cake
Good qualities swivels mechanism that appears to have the potentials to last a long times something that prior holsters have failed to do
I also like the magnetic closure which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the cases without the needs for finding a snaps fitting
My older Blackberries have had cases which after uses had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the twohanded method for nesting my phones one hands to move the flaps out of the ways and the other to insert the phone into the case
This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the morepreferred onehanded approach
Although still relatively new my new cases appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired therebies causing an obstruction
Before I purchased my Leather Swivel case I looked at 3rd party generic cases
Each of these were unable to notify my Blackberry that it was in its holsters
With my new swivel cases as soon as I insert my Pearl the displays shuts off therebies extending battery lives
In additions this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or not
Also since this is an OEM case it was made especially for my Pearl
When holsetered both the USB connectorthes earphones outlets and the volume controls buttons are all accessible
With nonOEM cases in orders to use a hands free devices or to charge my phones I might have to remove the phone from its cases
I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no cases at all
This is probably due to its small sizes and your abilities to just slip the phone into your shirts pockets unlike prior Blackberry devices
Of course that still exposes the vulnerable displays to significant scratchpotential
They should have at least provided a simple pouches which would provide some protections
This of courses is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel case which is the subjects of THIS reviews
Allinall I highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on your belts
You need to hunt down all the drivers and software for it on your own if you want it to work well with the e815s
but that was long enough for me to do a seem edit and so now Ill uses bluetoothobexes to sync and transfer
The chargers also connecteddisconnected constantly
making my phone beep every 10 seconds as it started to chargenot charge repeatedly
If you plan to use it for this purpose I recommend hunting down Moto phone tools 3
11 SDmodified p2ks seem and the e815s usb drivers usbmot2000
Besides all the functions described above the cables has one more functionit can be used as a charger tooThis is really cool
For every order I put I received the products within 34 days at the prices of grounds shippings fees
This battery has much better life than the batteries that come with the Q
I would say you can do twice as much talking surfing texting etcs
There are higher Mah batteries available for the Q but they cost 4959 so for 13 or so this is a pretty good deal
The only downsides and maybe I just didnt read description well enough is that the batteries doors is silver which looks dorky on my black Q
Though still not quite enough batteries for the juicesuckings Q it is worlds better than the included batteries
I would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original batteries as well to swap when the extended one dies
The battery Was ships within a days or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly
The Battery Makes the Phone Last 2 days even with continued use
Great buy if you use your Q like I do I watch movies play NES games listen to music ohs yeah make call send text messages etc
If you are like me and drop your phones constantly then this is a great products for you
I really like this case It is easy to put on and take off
It does not have that stupid plastics cover over the screen
It does not add a lot of bulk to my phones and I think it makes my phones easier to hold
I would really like for somethings to glow in the darks so that I could find it easier in the black holes that is my purse
Hey what kinds of phones is that Im getting the red one too and the pink one for my sweetie
I have tried 45 of theses phones over the last 4 years
The latest was the Cingular 8525 HTC makes it and it dropped 80 of incoming calls on pickups and 20 of outgoing calls
I thinks Windows was loading a DLL lt The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based SPs
I wasnt 100 sure Id want the 680 when it was first announced but a big nasty scratch on my 650s screen helped me decide to take the plunges
The lack of a protruding antennae makes it fit in my pocket much better the internal slots for the SIM card eliminates my worries that it might get lost and the covered SD card slots is very welcome because the darned thing always popped out in my 650
The only things lost from the 650 is the reset buttons
To reset the 680 you have to take out the battery
Thats not a big deal since even on the 650 you have to remove the batteries cover to get to the resets switches
Whats better on the 650 The main thing for me is that the cell phones radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards SDHC
I use this phone for everything since its also a great Palm organizer
In additions to that Ive installed a registered version of Pocket Tunes so its a very good MP3 players
Its even compatible with PlaysForSure if youres into that
I also use the phones to play games like Monopoly and Scrabble when Im waiting on line or in a boring meeting
I have absolutely zero complaints about this phones
Believe it or not i consider going from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrades
i guess the whole battery problems depends on the usage and the people
My batteries problems is that i cant kill the darn things
I am one of those people that depletes a batteries completely before recharging it
I do it to my laptops and my iPod and the PDA is had before the BlackJack the Tungsten 2E
Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks
Mainly because you CAN NOT create and edit word excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook
Even the contacts wouldnt backups Needless to say the Treo 680 saved me
If you do go the ways of the blackjacks without Outlook look into SBSHs programs Facade and Papyrus
However if you go with the lovely Treo checks out DialByPhoto i think the coolest parts is how you can set up a Favorite 5 like TMobile offers but still have all the reliabilities of Cingular
I just go the phones about 3 days ago and i love it
Some people ask me What can that things do and i responds to that what cant it do
I can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do
The last thing is that the price for everythings it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chances
The Pros PDA good mobiles phone that really gets out a cameras for all those Kodak Moments all packed in one for a good price
The Cons Youll need to get a replacement longer lives batteries Seidio makes one and the browsers Blazer has MANY problems
Im very happy with the purchases of this smartphones
Ive wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one
You can work around the problems with the unit with new batteries and browser software its a nice little phones
I havent bought a memories cards for it so I cant reports on the mp3s capabilities but I am going in that directions
Somehow I dont think it will replace my iPods but you never know
Ive had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications I especially love having the Goodlink emails applications my families videos mp3s pics and all my offices documents at a touches of a fingers
Yes the batteries lives goes quickly but I dont mind charging my treo every night
The slick and slim design is a real eyes catcher and feel great in the hands
in the one month of usage my Treos has hung one time a simple resets fixed it and hasnt hungs since
I bought this even though I saw a lots of negative reviews some about batteries life some about dropped signals
I have owned many Palm devices over the years and I will be the first one to say that Palm can make lemons and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later if they ever do
Not the most customeroriented qualityoriented companies out there
But their OS is still the easiest to use in my minds and with the myriad of appss out there you can make it do whatever you want pretty much
The screens is on the smallish sides compared to the TX but its not that bad especially for a phones
Its pretty reliable and I have put a lot of my old software on it
The battery is what surprised me the most I was expecting something really bad but so far I have never been under 50 and I am a heavy Palm user
I dont use the phones part of it much just a call here and there and I turn the phone function off at nights
I also bought KBLightsOff which turns off the keyboards lights unless you are using it which probably helps a lots
So with these two settings battery lives is close to the TX in my opinions
I have one dead pixel but that can happen to any electronics manufacturers
5mm jacks at the bottoms of the devices thats a terrible place to put it
But with an adapter I can use my good headphones and sound is good
Get pTunes Deluxe so you can use subsription music like Napster or Yahoo Music
I should receive my 8GB SDHC cards tomorrow which will turn my Treo into an iPhones killer IMHO
Sound levels is OK and you can get software that boosts it up if youre deaf
Speaker level is LOUD The SMS program is great the phone app is great and fast
I wish Palm wouldnt charges an arm and a legs for accessories but you dont have to buy from them
Overall I am very happy with this products it protects the phones without taking away from its beauty nor does it make the phones bulkier
My only compliants are that it does not come with a screen covers and it makes the phone slightly harder to slide open
I think this would work better with a monies type clip
However since Verizon doesnt carry anythings like this in clear this works
My chocolates phones is obviously valuable to me so I want to keep it in tips top conditions this skins is incredibely sexy and allows me to use my phones with eases
Promptly received two replacement batteries for our phones for the prices of one from the original vendor
They work great They hold a charges with normal use for about twothree days as did our original ones when we first purchased them
Bought this to replace my threeyearold cell phones and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc
Ive had a couple of questions that I asked Cingular only to be forwarded to Palm only to be forwarded to Microsoft then back to Cingular
It seems no Customer Service department has really mastered this units
The units turns off the sounds by itself and the only ways Ive found to fix it is to do a soft reset
Im not crazy about Microsoft Outlooks calendars compared to Palms
I miss several Palm features like the Go to and the Today buttons
Outlooks calendar just isnt as easy to manuever as Palms
Phone listening volume is low especially when the unit is in a protective case which puts it a little further from your ear
Love being able to press a picture to make a call
We have five kids I have each kids picture linked to their phones number
Even my technologychallenged husbands can call them by simply pressing their pictures
This phones talks A female voice announces who is calling and when your next appointment is
The first times she spoke it about scared me to deaths
The voice reminds me of the computers on Star Trekbut not as clear
However after getting used to her accents she is intelligible which means the computer is translating my written inputs into spoken wordsamazings
I dont need emails on the runs and I could live without this and the extra monthly costs
Most traditional Internet webs sites take much too long to load and display too small a portions of the pages to be useful
It is nice to check the weather or get directions on the goes
Cant imagines watching a movies or any complex video on this tiny screen
Splurged on a sweet little Vaja leathers cases that is wonderful
Amazons prices were the best BY FAR on this product Saved over 300 off my local retail Cingular dealers
Best parts I no longer have to carry a PDA and a cell phones They are one and the same
Conclusion this phone is very smart and funs to use although it comes with a big learning curves
The low volume issues could be a problems for someones with bad hearing
The whole process took only 5 minites on the phones with Cingular Wireless Customer Service to port over my numbers from Verizon
The Treo 750 was a snap to figure out setting up my emails took only a few minutes
Ive owned it for three weeks now and I am still discovering great phonePDA features
I bought a 4gb mini SD cards samsungs memory from ebay for 39
Combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs
Theyre about the best sounding earbudss you can get with a 2
Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750 but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it wont arrive for about a months and a half I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser prices and had it in my hands immediately
Because of Windows OS it is very easy to use and understand functions
I ordered this phones on Sunday evening and got it on Wednesday Amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones
Also I ordered two phones Family plan there was some problem in other phones I requested the replacement and Amazon FIRST sent me the replacements of that phones through FREE 1 days shippings and they gave me 30 days to return problems phone
I work for an University and my contracts was due 2 months ago
I decided to get this phone because my PDA was already old and I needed something that would be efficient
I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good things to say about it
First it is not as heavy as the last model 650 and also looks really cool
Second the interface is pretty easy to use and figure it out
The phones is Microsoft OS based I used a palm device before so getting use to it took me a couples of days but not really a big issue
The battery works really well and in spites of other reviews the lives have been pretty great even when compared with my last phones a motorola
In general I thinks is a pretty good buys and you can not beat the prices when Cingular sells it for ways more monies than Amazon
Ill definetively will buy from this websites again
I got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported like short time lived bateries
The only problems I am facing is with setting my voice mail
The icons shown in the todays pages does not accept any number I will to attach to it
As a results I was forced to create a new speed dial icons with my voices mail numbers
I really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by Palm with a downloadable files because except for this problem Treo 750 is really great
Fits my Treo 680 even in the case which is a big plus
hiim a satisfied costumer for the motorola i760 phones
Before all is had was a phone boothbut now that i got this phone no booth for me and evryone is sayen they want one too so im helpen
my husband uses this phones for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones ive ever heards
i dont know what its called but it has an upbeat technoes rhythm to it
the walkies talkies feature is very useful as everyones in his businesses network uses it all the times including him
its great for a businesses that has many locations
i only give this product four stars because i havents tried it myself so i donts know all the features
I came over from Cingular after trying there PTT just not happening for me and I will leave it at that
I choose this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall Love Blue I bought this for 110
00 at a corporate stores I get a discounts for the companies I work for
We had a problems with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the boxes phone
The clarities and eases of functionality is Fantastic you dont have to be a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the GPS along with Telenav is fantastic we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell towers I can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkies hey if your going to spend the money do it right the first times
I put the extended battery on mine and I get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge which too me is great
Dont change the default times for backlighting thats whats eating the battery time up also dont leave a javas applications in suspensions that will eat the battery up also
Buy the datas cables and add your own ringtones and backgrounds Moto has a phonebook managers package on there site which is FREE and is SO easy to use
For Ringtones and wallpapers u can use WebJal once again EASY to use
I looked at other phones and I DONT NEED CAMERAS in a phone the primary sellings features was the fact of large numbers and eases of uses
My husband and I just recently upgraded to this phone
We were going to got to the i560 but got a great deal on these
the other always came unclipped when I stood up falling to the grounds
The front screen for callers ID seems a little darks and the area to charge it is a little harders to get tothat plastics still gets in the ways Those are the only negatives so far
Since my husband is switching from an old i90 he loves it Hope this helps with purchasing
Also if you have no services you can use these as walkies talkies
I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving so I decided to upgrade my phones
the first 730s speakers grills came off and i tried to glue it back on ourselves
So I went to Nextel to get my new i760s after researching it on the internets
I didnt need a camera phones since I have a digital cameras that takes awesome pictures
One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April I couldnt sign back up for two years and get the 150
I could only sign up for a year and I had to pay 275
super short battery life especially if you have the webs
instead of having a separate button for each numbers keys it has three big keys with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys
unfortunately you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center otherwise youll dial the number above or beneath it
the juries is still out on this one but ill list it under cons
the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metals
it also shows the photo when you call that people
if you dont use the phone for a couple of minutes the phone will powers down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up
The only things I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the fronts especially since there were several colors
This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blues
I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo its well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable
The materials is soft to the touch but strong on protection
I dont like the lanyard they send with the product its about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces
I prefer a smaller more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist
I tripped and basically THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk
This is the second skins Ive owned the first from JAVOSkin and I like this one better than the first
The skin is thickers but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use
I didnt like the cords attaching bumps on the side at first but I did attach the cords and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag
I highly recommend this product whether or not you use the cords
I love the fact that I can now drop without it ending up in 3 pieces on the floor The only things I dont like is that its not exactly grey but not quite clear
but who cares its a great product for a great price
Idropped my new phone at the banks without this case and the phones went everywhere in 3 places
This items works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesnt easily clip into the phones you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it
This holsters provides good protections for the devices and has the sturdy swivel clips for your belt
The flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device
This is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt
My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks
I would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls
I have bought and returned three of these units now
Each one has been defective and finally I just gave up on returning the system
The DVD player constantly gives Bad Disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a discs
The sounds qualities is very nice for the prices but since the player doesnts work its essentially useless
I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups and the last 5 or so failed
I thought it was my software so I got new software
Guess what My first disc out of the new packages of 25 that I bought failed too
Its not my burner as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read as its brands new and doesnt require the firmware upgrade they mention
So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best
Im buying some now and save myself the frustration
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 disc I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever the case I wont buy them ever again
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent qualities
The only problems is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one
Im using the Plextor DVD burner love it but Im going to try my luck with a different DVD brands
Its less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burnings coasters
Please donts expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised To date Ive been denied twice
The second time they said the U P C number was invalid
Only its the original U P C barcodes I was meticulous filing the paperworks yet they state All required products were not submitted
Meanwhile I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaints
That said its definitely not worth the full askings prices
Well the poor rating given by those who have purchased this products has discouraged me from buying it
I need disc binders and the Case Logic brands while being the original is pricey
Low cost alternatives are needed but not at the expense of qualities and TCO total costs of ownerships
But the flap about poor customer services rebates and poor quality zippers and sleeve binding is enough to give me pause
So if someones from Xtremes managements is paying attentions
Price isnt everythings to everyones in the markts for your products
I use it for my digital cameras mp3s player and ipaq
It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a months ago for uses with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital cameras
After that everytime I on the cameras it wanted me to reformat the cardWTHs is that
Im always so confidences with my previous purchases from Amazon
One mistakes I madeI threw away the shippings and product packages once I tested out the card thought It worked and It would be OK
Needless to sayIm too over confident with LEXARs products
As the other reviewer found out these cards cant be formatted to work with SD Audio
did not fly either my machines is a media type and it far exceeds the systems requirements advertised by ADS
I exchanged the items and it was supposedly checked out before I got it
Tech support told me I was the only people having trouble with this products
They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones
My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and monies
ADS also told me it would not work with Uleads Movie Factory 3 some of the software it came bundled with but that was Uleads problem
I should use Cap Wiz Their programs DUH Guess what it did not work with their program either
Ulead said they had several complaints with ADSs products
Their final solutions hold on to the products and maybe they will have a new version of cap wizs and that might work
Save yourself times monies and aggravations buy another product P
Since ADS doesnts consider the product defective they will not refund your monies or allow you trade it in for an upgrade
I dont think they want a products like that either
When I purchased these batteries I was very pleased but that wore off after a couples of months
I dont use my cameras all that often but when I do I expect thers batteries to have some charge
I recharge them per instructions and they do not hold a charges any longer
I know Monster makes good products but I am a little disappointed in this ones
You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9
Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks
If you put a textbook on it and turn the pages it collapses and or tears the page
We bought this clock radio got it home sets it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that features on their alarms clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representatives at the customers service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okays not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in having an alarms clock if you cant trust that it will indeed wake you up
CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 monthsnow nap functions and radio are all that worksif only I could find the damns receipts
In the tens minutes since Ive had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off
More importantly It cant handle large manuals as advertised
The reasons I purchased this particular book holders My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter
Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages
If you dont anticipate needings it for a book that big then just glue the rubbers feet on keep an eye on the pages retainers these are the parts that fell off and you should be ok
As for me Im off to read Amazons return policies and see if I can get rid of this useless hunks of plastics
This is the worst thing I have ever owned It broke said there were no cds inside after about a weeks Do yourself a favors donts get this product dont buy this brand and dont buy from sears they sucked about the whole things too
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory sticks
But I could not insert My GIG cards into this reader
I tried hard trying not to break the card no success
May be because my cards was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanations of this problems
Any ways I had to send it back and buy 12in1 SanDisk Reader
Cons famous poppingcrackling noises makes it useless for gaming especially in BF2 which use OpenAL by Creative
This card has the most advanced sounds processor which does not work on at least 20 of high ends systems not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards see Google for XFi poppingcracklings
Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configurations change
For long time Creative denied existences of this problems
Eventually it was recognized see official CL forums and a new driver since November 2005 was promised at the ends of May 2006 but beta versions published 053006 did not solve my problems
In the cases of old audigy 2 z the problems was solved with unofficial hacked drivers
I suspect that XFi crackling is an architectures designs flow which can not be completely solved at software level because PCI buses can not provide sufficient memories accesses for the the fastest sound processor simultaneously with high ends graphic card HD controller and other devices
Bottom end I have to stop playing games or go back to low qualities integrated sounds
Do not take risk waits for working drivers or buy a working cards from different manufacturers
With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars
I found that many desktop motherboards MB have really slow south bridge south bridge is connecting PCI USB Firewire and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge especially MBs with NVidia chipsets and even with some Intel MBs
New betas XFi drivers and MB BIOS updates solved the problems in many cases but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4GSATA2 nVidia 6100 410 MCP chipsets but situation is still marginal and XFis might go unstable again
I contact CL customers services they did not solved the problem but pointed out that ATI chipsets Athlon 64 ATI 200 or 3200 have no problems with XFis
I decided not to return SB to seller but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB
I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale souths bridge and PCIX even NVidia based also should be fine with XFi
The troubles is that majorities of XFi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me
So I can give XFi two stars instead of 1 but I can not change the ratings and even more stars if it will work well in my new computers of after new driver release if it will work
About three years ago maybe four I bought two Lexar CFII cards
One never worked the other worked but lost all data
I wrote to Lexar that I had two bad cards they sent me one new card of the same size
I gave that to my girlfriends told her to only use it on pixes she didnt cares about losing
Nones of the file removal programs will get the images off Ive used all of them had their files removal tech helps give up
In this days age of just make the items I am upset
Do you want the only picture of your great grandmothers lost because you used a Lexar I wouldnt I use an actual sandisks card myself
If they ever Lexar made it right I may have written a better reviews but they havent
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself is not very accurate
Just in looking at the areas of a few blocks surronding my homes I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS sides sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplish much
Real irritating out on the roads as it is when you find one of their printed atlantes has been misbound and lacks several pages
The card worked fine for my sons graduations and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brothers wedding and I lost all the photos from that event
If you have an iPods or other remember to backup your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
Before the repair process there was one bad tracks on my CDs
After the repair process the entire disk was unplayable
With billions of CDs in the world is this the best that the 21st century has to offer
This SD would not work in my Nikon Coolpix S6 cameras but the Fuji and Sandisk products did
I bought this cards for my TJ25 supposedly a supported device
But the problems with this card make it nearly useless
Even if the browsers DID work it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full versions
The only downloadable browsers that works with the cards is Eudora which doesnt do anything except display texts you cant even fill in web forms with it so webmail searches etc
The cards is designed to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail software that comes with Internetenabled CLIE devices
obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card
The cards wouldnt connects to either my wirelesses networks or the neighbors even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either no additional configurations required
While attempting to connect the cards would often stop responding and then lock up the handheld
Bottom lines if you want a webenabled PDA buy a webenabled PDAs
ive given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after is used this CDs the sounds from my system did seem to be a little better the CDs were not skipping as much
but the bottom line is it didnt fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before
not sure if this has anything to do with the facts that my set has a 6disk CDs changers
I use this in conjunctions with the SanDisk Ultra II 2
I like it but the flash cards doesnts slides in easily
Sometimes it get stuck halfways as if the units has not been designed properly and the sliders for the cards offer enough gives to slide the card to the lefts or right of the pins
To add insults to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk
Therefore they SHOULD work seamlessly together but pathetically they dont
Id much rather pay more for a readers that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the things
For comparisons my camera accepts the card perfectly
There is no give at all but instead is an effortless process
Surprisingly the readers doesnt topples over as easily as I thought it would
It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in
Sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in
Eject the card from the PCs drive and then remove it
Overall Im glad to have it but its an annoyance to use it
I hate the cards getting stuck halfway in the reader
I wouldnt waste my money on any more of these POS disc
I wish I could return them to amazon but for what I paid it was pretty cheap its not worth the effort
2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008
Myself and other LCD owners have called for in homes services
00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranties and can not guarantee a fixes
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequencies
You may have to experiment a good deals to find a position where the signal reaches the cars radio adequately like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas
Even then if you are in an are with good FM radios coverage its going to be hard to find a frequencies where this will work
Mostly you cant use this with a covers on and youll need a car charger if you want to use it for long
The allinone modulator and charger that clips to the dockings connector is a better solution
I had two of them and they both broke within the first months
The company does have a 3 months warranties but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a months for my replacements
It is incredibly slow by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozens or so that Ive used
It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantities of small files
I attempted to copy 50MB 1500 files 800 directories to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy Thats roughly 27Ksecond
Deleting the files was painful as well taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything
For kicks I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drives and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds
Bottom lines is dont be fooled by the drives small physical sizes large capacities and price point it simply doesnt perform
I wanted to replace a Lexar 1GB with this but Ill keep looking
I used it to transfer a 700MB 2300 files My Documents folder to a new PC
The transfers seemed pretty slow but deleting those files from the Sandisk took 61 minutes Back it goes
Product MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
11132006 0751 am When will I get my repaired or replaced items
You have had this for 1 weeks without notifying me of the status
Please responds by the ways Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAYs
1113 Still waiting for an update on the M240 you received on 113
I bought this stereo because of its relatively small sizes and stylish appearances and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 players to it
The first unit I received would not turn on at all
I contacted Philips tech supports and their solutions was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense
Fortunately Amazon has a very nice return policy and I sent it back to them instead
Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacements right away without waiting until they received the defective unit
The replacements stereo arrived in short orders and I was immediately disappointed in the sound qualities which didnt seem as good as the 15 years old cassettes player boombox that I was replacing
After listening to the stereos for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMTNE3 bookshelf stereo that I own here are my thoughts
Both units have a thin wire types of antenna and both wires are about the same lengths
The Philips stereos however would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room my body interfered with the receptions
Playing the same song sidebyside on the two stereos I found that the Philips stereo had a flat tinnies sound when compared to the CMTNE3
The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality
Also there seemed to be significant distortion in the highfrequencies on the Philips stereos making S sounds sound more like H sounds
I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connectors on the aux input
The ergonomics of the Philips stereos are not so good
For one things the stereos will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped
If that happens the CDs can get wedged in the CDs tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove
The electronically actuated CD doors is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the toploading CMTNE3
The volumes goes up to 31 or so but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening
This means that there are only 4 quieters volume levels which is rather limiting
Finally the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buyings it
I am in the processes of returning this stereos and I will try to find a Sony system instead
Unfortunately Amazon no longer sells the CMTNE3 which I bought just about a years ago
I dont understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their products lines so rapidly
Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos The only differences between the Sony I bought last years and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs
I have to rate this products and this company as horrible
Less than 300 hours on it I called the company
It just blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should be
Additionally the fans diedwhiches may be why the lamps blew
Maybe there was a problems with the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldnt look at it No
The projectors was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in places
The company keeps sayingIts is out of warranties sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective products
I will get a new projectorI can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one
My new projector WILL NOTWILL NEVER be an Infocus products
Their services is overpriced and their technical support and customers services is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
I emailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector
my projector stopped working I have given up on it being repaired it was under warranty and am now
struggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pockets
the Better Business Bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
I was hoping for a great deals on these batteries but like other reviewers Ive found that they run out of juices incredibly fast
Im amazed that other reviewers have had such good lucks because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AAs ran out of juice in a couple days of normal uses while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AAs lasted only a weeks
Be warned that these arent quite the bargains they may initially seem
The worst customer services I have ever experienced
The lady who alledged to be the customer services supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect Viking cheats
This was a great mice for about the first year I owned
After one year is when all of the problems started
The mice now loses connections sproadically and sometimes it doesnt want to connect at all
I have changed the batteries quite a few times and that doesnt seem to help
It is very tempremental and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement
So a word to the wise in my experiences the mouse will work great for a whiles just be prepared to replace it in a years or so
It always freezes up half ways though the downloads when transfering photos to my computer
0 but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
The Xpress functions dont work properly and when used switches to different inputs each times
Most of the interaction with the remotes is done on the touch screens so you have to look for the buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no lives to them my disc started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the discs in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the discs about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
I did the research on this products and it was one of the best
I dont know that to be true due to the facts that the software that they sent me was a demo versions that was outdated for use
I have to buy another software packages to opperate the products that had stated in the description that the software was included
If your going to sell somethings false advertisements is not the way
You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that costs about the same
This is my main problem the sounds quality sucks compared to the competition out there
1 The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built
They sound muddy and the deep basses from them is nothing to write homes about
They are fairly light weights meaning very small magnets in them
These are 3 ways speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to be 2 way
2 The sound inputs consists of a headphones types jacks in FRONT
3 Its advertised as 320 watt which is meaningless since the speakers suck
What good is a high powers amp with crappy speakers
And in case you know some audio 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts logs relationship
For some reason this is not even halves as loud as my 100 W receivers
4 No user adjustable equalizer only presets possible
5 Can not connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping types of connections
6 The receiver sucks even my Sandisk flashes players seems to have a better receivers
I concur with the other reviewer Death to Sony Shame on them for taking consumers for a rides
This companies nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it Competively with the others meaning fat profit margins
Im so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases
They were great a HARD covers with rubberized coatings and actual cds case styles holders inside that you pop out with your fingers by pressing the centers
Somebodys could have sat on it and it wouldve been fine
I mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card
For your psp if the games is really important to you and you cant save it
Just presses up on the power switches real quick the screens will go off
it will go on hold and next time you wan na plays it again
and hopefully if you did it right youll have the game right back in the place you left it
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in
The major problems is that the units only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connections to the wireless networks
Once you unplug and plug back the power cords it will work fine for another twelves to 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every times it hangs but I dont accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang
I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering it down and back up it never did work again If you buy one go through the setups and if it doesnt works immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON Dont waste your precious time trying to get a 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your times
Finally Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the tops of the lists to keep the potential customer from being discouraged
However YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES
If the product is in facts good it wont have many bad reviews or even possibly nones at all if it is exceptional
However look up all the bad reviews for this product
They should tell you that somethings is seriously wrong with this products
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individuals tankswhiches is why I bought the things but now the prints heads isnt working rights
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problems is still there
The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canon websites they dont even acknowledge this printers ever existed
Consumers reports rates it a best buys but I disagree
Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthlesses to have a 2 megapixels or higher cameras because the quality will not be seen with this printer
I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture qualities was superior to the Cannon
five stars ratings are from people that JUST bought this MP3
I bought the white 512 for my sons at the same times
Whith in 3 weeks my sons was no longer working at all he had it in his back packs and some how it got crunched enough to never work again I was not happy
Also in a few months mine started to have issues
And the main toggles was a complete failure for Sony
I accually removed the covers to the toggles and just moved the joy sticks under it to change songs or volume
I have done a lots of research this times and I will not buy another Sony
The hold buttons that is part of this sliding doors never works I find the player deads in my gym bags all the times Apparently the door slides over a bit and the players will turn on FOR HOURS and than you have a dead players
Maybe Sony should have given us a onoff button than this would not happen Dont do it folks look into other options even my moms iPod Nano is better designed than this jokes of an MP3 player
First off let me states for the record that I only buy Sony but I have to
advises you against the purchases of the bean walkman
I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006 as I had purchased replacement
insurances and was able to return it because it broke
It is hard to turn off and the usb port covers always pops open not to mention the headphones
The FM receivers is hard tune in the daylights as the screens is invisiable
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisks has a disk errors that doesnt allow for more photos after only using 40mb
I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP
Bad investment Would not recommend the product unless there is a ways I can get a refund or an exchange
I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
get about 50 rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasions
multiple CD RWs with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers
You have to be very careful taking the cd out or it would fall apart
I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problems
In October 2004 I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon
After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed I immediately found a few images corrupted
format the CF before use there were alway corrupted images
I wonder if I can return the defects CF card and get a replacements from Amazon or from manufacturer
I have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computers Imac w Intel chiphardly outdated simply doesnt recognize themlike I never put in a disc at all
The kickers is that this spring I also ordered two spindles of these discs exactly the same as far as I can tell from which I burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one for a freind overseas
I have no idea what the deals is but have a feeling that the issues is not the qualities of the discs
The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not send in MailinRebate
Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode SanDisk sent me a post cards stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcodes
How can I resubmit when they already have the barcode
In my experience with SanDisk I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted so you get mailin rebate 50 of the time with SanDisk
I think mailinrebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
I really expected a better product and durabilities from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
This was the worst purchase of any type of computers hardware that I have ever made
It felt very light and flimsy the definitions of cheap plastics
Not just the construction but the performance was terrible
It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHINGs for about 10 minutes
Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one but I wouldnt take that chances again
I wish I could give this devices a worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x
Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burners
So if you are looking for 16x do not buy this one
Its been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was shipped from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my orders
When I contacted EMARTCRAP all they could tell me was that it had been shipped
I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete
Your are better off paying a higher prices for better service
Cosmetically pleasings is about the only good thing you can say about this unit
The included software is a reminates of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second editions it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the units back in to get it to respond again
This units would be great if it came out 7 years ago
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that nones of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dyes available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no lives to them my disc started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the discs about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cdsdvds
I cant give a complete reviews of the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvds
How do I assign a rating As several other people have experienced my unit is also DOA
I received it plugged it in pressed cleans and the motor started up
I popped open the cover put in the disc I wanted cleaned and pressed cleans again
Whats worse is the units cases is glued together no ways to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
I ordered this on the recommendations of another Amazon customer
I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make much differences with any of my discs
I dont think this is a good repairers of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged disc by buying another copy of your CDs or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
I purchased this flash card in June for my GPS memory
Card lost all its memory and was unable to take a new loads
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuses in my cars for the cigarette lighter
I bought a Vector brands inverter at WalMart and it is much better
This items worked for a whiles but required fiddlings unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time I restarted my cars
Eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighters sockets
The products not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car
The mechanics who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it
I have written to your customer services department and asked for monies back but to no avail
I will not purchase another things from Amazon until my money is refunded
About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling
It has an alarms that sounds when your battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately
I figured that my cars batteries was not fully charged or on its last leg
Now that Im taking another trip I thought Id try it out in other cars
The thing is dead doesnt do a things when I plug it in
Each times you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data
When this adapter first arrived I thought it was great
The sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortion and interferences I get from using an FM transmitterstyles adapter there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area
The first days I used it for about 20 minutes total didnt have far to drive and it worked great
I didnt expect it to last forever but less than an hour
Yes it has a 1 years warranty just send the units back with a monies orders 6 to cover the return postage
Of courses then youre spending more in postages than you originally spent for the unit
I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it
I had purchased the FM transmitters for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my cars had a tape deck I would give this a tries
I was excited that I had all my ipod musics with me BUT after less than a weeks it the sounds started going down hill to a point where I couldnt listen anymore with it
My guess is I will need a radios in the cars that is ipod compatiable cables
No kidding The shipping charge on these batteries was over 6
Amazon doesnts itemize the shippings charges on your orders so if you orders multiple items you wont know that youre being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receivers does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself is not very accurate
Just in looking at the areas of a few blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facilities was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with the receivers I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
I suspect that is because the cables on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplish much
Real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
These Xtreme cd cases STINKsliterally I dont know what kinds of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic but the smells is absolutely nauseous
I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away
In theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these 2 for me 1 for a friend I cant say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractivenesses and compactnesses
Ive only got this things to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row
Ive spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks
After MONTHS of emails and phones calls customers services responded
What a jokes They told me the plugs in the units and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in
Gim me a break I shouldnt have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work
I was impressed with this controller at first and found it to feel comfortable and works well
It was played with once and a while for about a months total 10 hours maxes
Some times after that the next times I went to use it it would only go left in a game that used the left joysticks
I could not get it to center or even stay still it would just keep either steering the cars like Burnout3 or whatever the left joysticks would do for the game no matters what
I tried it several times and it has never worked since
I fire it up once and a whiles to see if its still doing it and it does
I am very dissapointed in this and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller
I think I paid about 45 locally for it and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shacks on clearances for 19
99 that works and feels as good but is less than half the costs
I dont really feel like going thru a warranties claims if its even covered but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox drawer of extra stuff
I was going to go totally wireless 4 units and luckily didnt run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers
I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there
If the Pelican holds up model PL2050 version 2
0 I might go get some more if I can find them locally
I am a gamer and i know a good controllers when is feel it
I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two in that times you love it
but after a months its breaks down and turns into a heaps of craps thats a dreads to play with
The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyments
Im just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isnt on the grenades trigger and i just threw a grenade
Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receivers
After the contollers started breaking down is had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breaths of fresh air
I bought this items not to cool my laptops but to provide some insulations from the heats when its on my laps sitting in a chair
Im very satisfied with its being able to accomplish that
HOWEVER the cords ended up breakings after a few months
Targus replaced it at no charges which is good but still a hassle
Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on
After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first
The is perhaps the leases durable items I have purchased in 40 years
It lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led golds but it refuses to do anythings with my xd card
It worked just fine for 34 days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable
The DVDs are a ripoff although Im counting on the REBATE to at least break even not counting my time
Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalizations was not an issues
Just a poor products Velocity ought to be ashamed
Id recommend Verbatims DVDR DL products made in Singapore
As a note I can get other DVDRs to work just fine
I havent submitted the rebates yet so no comments on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesnt works
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader
I tried hard trying not to break the card no success
May be because my cards was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12in1 SanDisk Reader
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good products and good services I got a shuffles and something happened the second times I tried to load musics to make it not even play
I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America Minneapolis MN and they claimed to know there was an issues and claimed to have fixxed it
Gee thanks Ill be looking at another brand Apple stinks
Maybe if these were high ends rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable prices
But for Alkaline This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell
You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this prices
As you can see from the other reviews the speeds on this things is pathetic almost to the points of nonfunctional when it comes to many small files
I had a small game on the drives but it has tons of small files in the folder
makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this things
512MB Mini 256MB Mini before I bought this product
Performance wises this particular product is not doing good
Its taking long times to copy files from my computers
Even its taking long times to delete files from this disk
So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisks
I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacities more than 512MB
Now Im planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drives
Better buy some good one than wasting your times on this products
A moderate inconveniences was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons
Product MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240s
11132006 0751 am When will I get my repaired or replaced items
You have had this for 1 weeks without notifying me of the status
Please respond by the way Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAYs
1113 Still waiting for an updates on the M240 you received on 113
No where near as easy to use as my old systems But with trial and errors can have a decent amount of controls over your Projects
But one interesting things someone mentioned earlier
is that regardless of with systems you use these labels can alter
the way DVDs plays making them stick and freeze and wonderings if its the disksburners or what
confirms that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making
It might be the weights but i think its possibly the way the beams shines through the disc and reflects off the white labels backings
Dunno but if you all of a sudden starts having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpies
I connected all the cables as instructed but it doesnt work the lights is not on
These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card
There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacities or qualities
I have given a single star ratings cozs it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Accelerations
Very Few camera support this technologies and one can easily get the same capacity 12x at 14 the mentioned prices
SO why pays more if your cameras does not support this technologies
Its not somethings you can just throw away if it decides to stop working
Delivery was great only took them a couples of days
The connector to the cpens was for some reason cuts in halves
Without it you cant recharge or connect the cpen to the pcs
I called their main offices all the way in Sweden during the offices hours
I dont cares if the product itself is greatIll never know now will I
If youre unable to receive support when you need em youre screwed
If youre just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and dont really care if youres on your own go ahead and try it
Otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to aftersales support
I have to rates this products and this company as horrible
Less than 300 hours on it I called the companies
It just blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should be
Additionally the fans diedwhich may be why the lamp blews
Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranties but they wouldnt look at it No
The projectors was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in places
The company keeps sayingIt is out of warranties sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etcs
They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective products
I will get a new projectorI can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current ones
My new projectors WILL NOTWILL NEVER be an Infocus products
Their services is overpriced and their technical support and customers services is nothings more than drones citing manuals and warranties
The worst customer service I have ever experienced
The ladies who alledged to be the customer service supervisors saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect Viking cheats
This items was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera but was never delivered
Now Amazon wants me to review it so here your are
This is a good products sounds great gets good battery lives everythings youd hope for in an iPod dock
The iPods docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves
After a little bit of uses the connections between the iPods and the docks deteriorated to the points that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sounds cuts out all together
If they added some kinds of simple support so that bumping the iPods wouldnts stress the electronics Id give this things 5 stars
But without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good
Luckily I didnt pay a pennies for the motorized SkipDr
which worked every times and I always end up using it instead
It has more than paid for itself in repaired CDs20 for an entire kit at a wholesale clubs that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebangs
The motorized version didnt come with any deep scratches sanding pads which I need about 25 of the times for a badly scratched discs
Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a discs is even in the machines and wont starts turning so I have to squeeze it together to make it work
One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel buttons and it did not work straight out of the box
Beyond that setting it up takes time but is not difficult
I am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out
I have six devices connected to my HD televisions set
The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and in my cases routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote
I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly
At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellites receiver at a certain time during the days to record to Replay TVs which can not turn the TVs on and off
I have two NiMH chargers and sonies batteries wont charges in them
They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers
They force you to buy their own nonstandard chargers that probably wont again charges other brands batteries
Dont waste your money or supports Sonys attempts to bring nonstandard products into a standardized markets
Soon we have to carry bunches of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
Once again Im amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product
These are terribly uncomfortable for my ears and dont really provide that great of listening experience
The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds and then they become distractingly uncomfortable
But of courses this is just my experience your mileage may vary as they say
Personally I found my Apple iPods phones to be better
My two rear speakers just stop working and also my
I dont have any other rear speakers to try on the systems
while the verbatims has burned well in 100 of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvds players
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that nones of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dyes available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my disc started dying after a few months
In additions in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the disc about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
This media did not work on my brands new asuss burner even after updating the firmwares
Can capture analog videos and produce cdroms but I expected the abilities to produce DVD
Instead buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more
Uleads software is stable and its not a trial versions
It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture
Pinnacles Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy
I got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long terms risky cells
It could be because the clock draws even when the radios part is off but Im
If these were free ids still would not recommend them due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings
It is the disc I must assume since my burner works fine with other brands
Anyway now I think its best to invest a bits more and get good media
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years
Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit
Currently only ONE still works I have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years
These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down
My G5 macs was so powers hungry that I had to use one for the computers and another for the 23 inches LCD
I cant comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores
There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APCs popularities rather than the poor reliabilities of their brand
My experience over the past four years has been mixed
These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes
If you really fear the losses of data during a blackout then the answers is clear
I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms
Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance
The units I puchased were identical and only one units is still operational after four years
I can accept the need to replace the batteries every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries
Prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendors
Battery life depends on many factors so I dont begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop workings is unacceptable
I bought APC branded batteries and cant explains why the recurrent failures
Im frustated with my APC products but it may be a problems with this model
Just bewares of the hidden costs of batteries replacement when purchasing an UPS
I had this card for more than 6 months and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510
Then all of a sudden for no reasons I kept getting card error on my computers and digital cameras a week ago
My SDUSB converter couldnt find the cards either
I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good
I purchased this Boombox over a years and a halves ago
What I do like abouts is that it was hard to find a boomboxes with a remote and Mp3 playback
It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last
You can not rewindfast forward in the songs in Mp3 formats but you can do it with a regular audio cds
sometimes I like to hear a certain portions of a song again but I will have to play the entire song again
I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I can not do anymore
This thing was slipping and sliding all over the places and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place
The slots on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the hold feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the things over to turn it on and off
The little plastic protectors that covers the screens would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicons covers and the ipod
I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair prices tag
I think Ill just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustrations and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the users ID should be left blank to log in
The major problem is that the units only works for twelves to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
After twelves to 36 hours it looses the connections to the wireless network
Once you unplug and plug back the powers cords it will work fines for another twelve to 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every times it hangs but I dont accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang
I ordered the 2year service plans on May 1st this day July 31st I still have not recievied it
I have contacted them a numbers of times and still nothings
I purchased this items and one months later I still have not received any paperwork
This is a complete wastes of monies for a number of reasons
This hubs will not work with any USB powered devices
So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hubs
Be aware that if you want to connect your printers scanners ipod etc
i purchased the DLO actions jacket neoprene for 20 40GB ipods for my wife for use on walks etc around town
The circles that is supposed to lines up with the ipods doesnt
The plasic parts covering the ipods is awkward and doesnt align either so you cant press the play button
So since the ipods doesnts fits in the case overall this products is useless
pls save your time and monies and consider another ipods cases
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individuals tankswhiches is why I bought the things but now the print heads isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problems is still there
The pages have splotchy black marks and the text are only partially printed
Went to the canons website they dont even acknowledge this printers ever existed
I suffered with this clocks for a year because it was a gift and expensive
Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finaces says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the rooms
The sound is soso and it has no batteries backups lose powers for a second and you have to reset everthing
It is also very big taking up 12 my nightstand
The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radios stations where I live
This morning I finally gave in accepted realities and tossed it in the trashes
We bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarms clocks
how bizarre They do not carry batteries back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer services center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chances however whats the uses in having an alarms clock if you cant trust that it will indeed wake you up
I would like to believe that this hubs works well but I wouldnt know
I bought it to reduce clutters on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermacs
I hooked up my printers ipod and digital camera and nothing happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an acs adaptors
It doesnt come with one and doesnt say anythings about one in the manual or instructions or their website
They said I could get it at radios shacks and gave me the info 5 volt 2
Ive been to two radios shacks and onlines they dont carry it
I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds
The sound quality was good but the dependabilities of this items is questionable
Good things first efficient on batteryconvenient and compact
doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphones to carry around to charge
As most of the other reviewers have said this products is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY
I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software
even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartnesses of software where it tries to control the music piracy
I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer
I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman
Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computers
the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back
I tried every tricks and even the sony customer support could not help me a very indifferent group of people
It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money
Of courses transfering the files to this players is an entirely diff stories and I dont want to go abt that
I have an Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected
First of all the shipping on this item costs more than the items itself
I did get it quickly 2 or 3 days but I had several problems with it
1 I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the players hung
Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond
I tried over 10 times and got the same results each times
2 I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well
Had to CtrlAltDel to get my DVD players software to close
3 I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computers
It is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them
On the flip side once they have been opened once they dont reclose very well
I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
get about 50 rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasion
multiple CD RWs with critical materials would NOT read on multiple computers
The labels are great and the spring devices that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful
There is no direct Macintosh program rather there are templates
They were written for old versions of software and really dont work right
The Windows sides includes an actual Print Shopstyle program which works awfully
If you do get this make your own templates on AppleWorks or PowerPoint
I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex shames on you
after purchases they want the buyers to call for the service agreements
of course you want a hard copies that is why you bought it
really not in the businesses to fix things but to make monies not fixing things
If you had anythings to do with the device not working e
you dropped it forget about it they aint gon na fixreplace it whatever
They have a very sparce networks of repairs companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your areas you have to ship it to them in Virginiaof courses you have to pay for the shippings
Lastly they tend to screw over their repairs companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N
W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N
W will take months to pay them for the works they did
If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
will waste your times monies and your every last nerves before repairing your product
Eventually they will but not without an exhausting protracted fight
Im not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty someodd dollars and was handed a coupons for a 40 rebate
But I wish that someones had informed me before I lugged it all the ways home that when you sing into the mic your voice doesnts come through the speakers
Im cools with the machines sound quality when it comes to playing a CDG
If I tap the mic I can hear an extremely faint thud so I know its on but the volumes too lowand yes I adjusted the mic controlsif you want to sing along
Which makes this a dinosaurs a booms box in the age of the iPod
Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadnt been opened
Also occationally I use a cards reader SimpleTech to writeread that cards to transfer some big files between computers
Its all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full and after a cards reader reading I got CF card errors on my camera
Fortunately after I delete a few pictures I could move on
I gave the cards to other people so I dont know how its doing now
After that I purchased another Viking 512MB half years ago
I used it to transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet
Now I am getting consistent CF cards errors message on my camera even after reformat for several times while I dont have that problem if I use another card
One theory I heard was that a cards reader may damage a cards
Anyway I will have to buy another card now and it wont be viking for this time
They gave me a number for returns and I mailed back my damaged CF cards
They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipts
I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters
I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever the cases I wont buy them ever again
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
Being a graduate student and living in an apartment I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off courses materials and assignments
50100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimates and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them
The items did arrive in a timely fashions and it arrived in the specified condition
I use it for my digital cameras mp3 player and ipaq
It takes forever to copy anythings to and from it
Bought this a months ago for uses with my DX4330 kodaks 3MP digital cameras
After that everytime I on the cameras it wanted me to reformat the cardWTHs is that
Im always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon
One mistakes I madeI threw away the shipping and products packages once I tested out the cards thought It worked and It would be OK
Needlesses to sayIm too over confident with LEXARs products
I record dvd movies as a hobbies and am always looking for better media software etcs
Id been using Ridata for some times w next to no coasters but figured Id upgrade and go with memorex this time around
I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies Ive done
Were it a compatibilities issue I could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media
I bought the ADS upconverters because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co
didnts offers HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellites provider that did offer HDTV too many trees around my house
I wasnt expecting the upconverters to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV pictures but for 550 I was expecting the upconverters to do something that was actually noticable
When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the pictures and tell me what she thought
She looked at the TVs and said okay Im ready turn it on
I said quotits IS ONquot This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it
The images I got for my digital cable was certianly different but thats all it was different
In fact in some instances I though the pictures was worse
I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the products is best for even though thats not what I got it for
So I did and to be honest I really preferred the pictures I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverters
It didnt matters what display format I put it in it just didnt do anythings to improve the pictures
If you cant get HDTV dont expect this boxes to give you anythings close to the next best things
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit
The included software is a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablets itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again
This units would be great if it came out 7 years ago
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CDs
Out of the past 20 burns I have only had 10 DVDs burn successfully
I use Roxio CD Creator versions 7 which does a great job with my CDs so Im pretty sure its the DVD media
Not only am I wasting all my money but my time as well
Ive tried to lower the burns speeds but it does not matter
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer
I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my disc
I dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged disc by buying another copies of your CDs or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
Not sure if I just got a lemons or what but would never purchase this players again
It worked right most of the times but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button
I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly
Its now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was times to stop working
Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for
Forks out the extra cash and purchase another brands
Hi I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006 and was able to set the region codes to 0 to watch all DVDs
After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks and unplugging it the region code has automatically set back to 1 and I can not change it anymore What happened When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings 1 and
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my cars for the cigarettes lighters
I bought a Vector brands inverter at WalMart and it is much better
AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIMEs
THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOOD
The sound was great but the DVD would lag every 1015 seconds during any and all movies
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need but its mp3 player is really bad Audio just pops before moving to a next song
It looks like what Philips people just do in all of their electronics
I really dont wants to talk about this any more because William R
When I first heard about this boards I was incredibly excited
I have been playing BF2 Battlefield 2 for almost a years now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys
So it was a godsend to be able to purchase somethings like this directly intended to help me be better at my game
The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing the first that I have seen
But the prices for each is kind of high but well worth it
The board is constructed well but dont expect this to replace your home keyboards
The Windows Keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any runofthemill keyboard but it is awkward to type with I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard
Ingame typing is difficult at best with the gaming keysets
With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 12 of the keyboards are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 12 side they are all vertical not staggered
like UJ and M keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other
When you push them down they dont bounce back as much
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board and the BF2 keyset 9 keys went completely dead
I tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail
I contacted supports and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty bases units
DUH They are reviewing my warranties but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 days
Maybe this posts is premature but I dont think I am getting a new base units
The expression Great Idea Bad Execution holds true here
Ideazon has too many issues not enough supports staff and a website that doesnt do anything but look good
Sleek design super users friendly sharp images and easily unlock to all region
Never had any problems loadings or playings until last weeks
Went completely dead for no reasons in the middle of a movies
It wouldve been a greater products if it lived pass 1 year at least
The players stopped working after only a few months it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them
That behaviors started out as intermittents but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go
We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the players away in the trash
Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping
This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste
Save your times and monies and buy another machines
I would like to believe that this hub works well but I wouldnt know
I bought it to reduce clutters on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermacs
I hooked up my printer ipods and digital camera and nothings happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an ac adaptor
It doesnt come with one and doesnt say anythings about one in the manual or instructions or their websites
They said I could get it at radios shack and gave me the info 5 volts 2
Ive been to two radios shacks and onlines they dont carry it
I bought these thinking they were a good deals but now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers
I bought 24 of these and one years later I have four left that will take any sorts of charge
The ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each
I also have several high end chargers that dont want anythings to do with the ones that died
On the bright sides I have several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital cameras and they have been A after 2 years
I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now
These batteries will not hold a charges and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives
I dont know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is but these didnt last being on the shelf for a little over a years
To be short the performances is less than great but OK but I can live with that since I have dozens of them I dont care if it runs out faster
But what I couldnt stand if that it also set my charger on fires since one of them leaked I couldnt imagine what would happen if I didnt come to my desk in time
I bought this as a travel chargers for my Blackberry
I followed instructions in the manual which are pretty easy and charged up the Solio
After waiting twice as long as required I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it chargedbig mistakes
Not only did it not charge a weird red batteries icon came on in the upper lefts of the screens and then the blackberries promptly crashed
I tried this routine several times over several days with the same results rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous
Finally I had enough and told the customers services for Solio that I was returning it
Not only did they never return my monies I had to call my CC companies to handle it no one ever said what the problem could be
My advice Stay away from this thingits may seen cool or environmentally friendly but it is junks a piece of overpriced junk
Musselman can add 2 more cards to his connectors problem
I have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna I plan to return it all
Sound quality was fine but this CDs changer doesnts works well at all
I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changers
Tried to play shuffle with all disc and it just stops playing after a while
It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CDs
Apparently Sony didnt do proper qualities testing on this products
I returned ours and after these other reviews wont be replacing it with a Sony
But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken
I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchases but because this unit is a Sony I trusted it would be a superior products
The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews When playing CDs in random mode the units consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a CD and quitting
I followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 discs changers
The one I just bought has an analogue tuner and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very highpowered pops and around here countries stations
The tuners requires extremely small movements to move way up the dials
I bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husbands decided to invest in a new digital cameras and a photos printers
The digital camera still works greatthe printer is another matter
While this one prints beautiful pictures the costs of inks far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes
As we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink
Replacing every cartridges at once will run you about 75 at a time give or take a few
The gray inks is used up the quickest and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally
The main problem I have with this printers is that the quality is excellent after you replace the inks but for only about the first 5070 pictures
The pictures take on too much of a magenta casts and start to get out of registerveries frustratings when youres printing out any pictures let alone ones of your child
Yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printer cartridges heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion
Every other times get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third graders took a crayon to
In the long runs I will not be buying a photo printers for home use but will rather take them to a stores for processing
Qualitywise it gets you in the beginning but doesnt hold out for the long run
My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas presents for me
I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week
Photos had extreme amount of yellows in them such as yellow faces and hands no proper fleshes tones
I call HP support and was told that my printers was out of warranties because the warranties starts when the printers was manufactured not the purchases dates
I was offered one free calls but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had
I was given a case number but when I called HP back stating my cases numbers they said that this was no longer a free call
I explained it was an extensions of the first calls but they refused to work with me
I think HP warranties policy stinks and would not purchase another HP products as long as this policy stands
But when it is recording forget about changing channels
It is really really slow and takes like forevers to even receive any remote clicks
Broadband feature is nice but USB doesnt come cheap
A clocks radio that you have to fumble for a remotes to use
I have the older models CD Clock Radio and they are nice but the new models is irritating
I also have the IPOD players and at least the volumes controls are on the system
I cant keep a systems that I have to locate a remote to operate
I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK
I AM A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR
I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE
COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY
This carrying case worked well for me until I jumped in my car and the case caught on the doors frame and the belts clips ripped right off of it causing my iPod to fall to the pavement
It turns out the clips isnts fastened on all that securely
After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up I still cant get more than a 20db signal from my guitar
Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screens
I contacted kingstons and they said that this module hasnt been tested on dells machines and is configured to work on generic computers only I wouldnt recommend this memory for dell 700m users
Huge flaws in this products requires that it be restarted daily
This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP in orders for it to stay visable to your computers
Second problems I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare and even at 35feet from the AP the units is around 1136mpbs
Do not buy this products find another companies who stands behind there products
All of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in India
People on the phones donts know how to help you and email supports is a jokes
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with
Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screens and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them
Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems
I even sent it to them at one points and they sent it back in exactly the same conditions I sent it to them
After my experience with this Palm I will never buy Palm again
This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over
We thought it was the battery going bad but a new batteries didnt helps
I am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my homes and office for several years
While some Linksys units have worked for me more often I have found them undependable
In particular the WPS54GU2 set up fine but I almost always had to cycles the power to get it to work each time I printed
THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR Total JUNK
I bought this HD because my Lacie which had lasted over 5 years crashed on me finally
Out of the box this products looked great although it was very large and heavy
I immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up however that was the ones and only time that it booted
I tried several more times and it wouldnt boot up
VERY VERY scary when you buy a new devices to hold all you important data and it wont boot up out of the box
I dont know if this products just happened to be the one that sucked but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data
I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaons
Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone
I record my violins pieces on my laptops and used an ordinary computers mike for this
But I wanted a more sensitive recordings and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mikes
The gain was lower than the ordinary mike it doesnt works at all without the batteries but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory
Unfortunately sony doesnt have good services centres wholl entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drains
SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sounds completely disappeared with Vista upgrade save for the Windows startup musics
I thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back
Might have but it says not compatible with Vista
are you serious I bought this a while ago to see if it was cool
It is a piece of junk u can barely get any channels and even if you do you can barely see them and it has loud static
if you want to watch it in your car you have to cover it because the back lights is too week
The items was not difficult to install but the adaptors plate did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks
I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised
once I got the tv up it is ok and getting the tv up to it is a 3 people jobs and it takes two to lift it up as it should for safeties reasons but a 3rd people needs to hold the arm steady
I did find out there is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks
I had to return the first tv to the store and round up helps when I got a replacements
Now it looks like I may need to do that again as the replacements tvs has problems also
This whole things with the mounts and tv has been very frustrating
These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blanks media Ive EVER encountered Theyre made by CMC Magnetics well known as the worst media manufacturer in the worlds
But not only are they CMC Magnetics theyre the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics
The latest KProbe hangs when faced with these forcing a hard resets
The latest Neroes Burning ROM hangs when faced with these forcing a hard resets
The program continues nonstop to display waiting for media when I use these and an attempt to abort hangs Windows XP SP2 the same ways it hangs Kprobe
Curiously the media IDs on these are exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CDR media theyre made by CMC Magnetics as well
However at least the Philips are recognized by all my software and hardware quite unlike the Verbatims
Thats why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics
The Philips are no prize either but they perform minimally well
The ONLY thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling
But whats the point of labeling disc you cant even RECOGNIZE let alone burn
I had the exact same problems with these media in both my LiteOn LH201AH burner and my NEC ND2510A burner the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burners for even lowquality media
Notes that Verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden
But stupidly they chose to go ultracheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp
I found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between works and home but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of
Im glads I back up my data in more than one places
Do not be fooled by the flashy metalliclooking picture
The plastic shell of this devices is the qualities of McDonalds toys
One would think that for 300 the company would at least commissions a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cuttings
In order to turn the device on you have to press very firmly which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shells
The cables ports for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy and you have to hold the cables firmlies in places in order for the downloads to take place otherwise the connections will be lost
I am a premedical student and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this products believing that I could for 8 seconds a pages and 100 pages per disks scan my science textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that way I thought I would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least 100 each
However I now see that this beliefs was naive to say the least
The words come out distorted like a jammed faxes machine and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDFs the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate
Furthermore downloading is very slow at least 15 seconds per pages on my fast computers and since you cant see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer you will have to rescan about 80 of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibilities
I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this products
I would have saved myself a lots of monies and times
If you are a users who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents then this product may work okays for you although a digital cameras will probably deliver better results
If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going allout paperless with this products you will find yourself extremely disappointed
Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semidecents shells manufacturuers it will not a good buys
The idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential especially when coupled with a Tablet PC
However the execution of the idea needs improvements
I hope to see a far better version of this products in the next few years at a price that is comparable to qualities
The paper is just heavyweight paper thats perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves
which takes some efforts not sure if itd be quicker just getting heavyweight papers and using a paper cutting boards
Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious times
No you cant make the templates shows rightside up
to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS
Im not kidding I guess you could also turn your monitor on its side
You can rotate the texts so it shows the way it should
So youll have to turn your head or monitors back and forth sideways
What kinds of companies would sell such a product
if youres looking for templates for the DVD Inserts
Another things is that there isnt a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd
I was wrongly advised by tech supports to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo
Be sure your computer is supported because Targus tech wont give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you cant safely maake it work with an unsupported computer
I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didnt keep it and try to make it work
After about 3 weeks of operations the fans clicks and buzzes like crazy
I bought this product as a way to keep a large amounts of backup data saved however I have fought with the drivers for days now
Whenever the drive is working the usbs on my computers does not work if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes even with the newest updates I will be returning this product ASAP
Im very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again
This was my second Netgear product I bought previously a wireless modems which I was only okay with not impressed The idea of a networks storages appeals to me
In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky things and be careful on the drives you buy for it
Well I searched and searched and found a drives that worked and bought both yesterdays
Tried to set it up today and connecting the drives went pretty well but that is where everything started to go down hill
Midway through the installs it tells you to okay any error messages which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors and suddenly my computers reboots
Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well and it never goes back to the installs like most programs do when they require a reboots
Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101 you need to look in to your own computer
To quote Netgears web sites SCSI disks drivers from the Promise companies conflict with the SC101 device drivers
Promises drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives
My computers is just a weeks old and has these newer drivers
Back in the boxes the SC101 goes and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me
Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests and none works
This is where I get really frustrated Netgear support
I waited 35 minutes for someones to pick up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own faults and Id have to pay to have that crp yes he said it from my system
I needed to hire a local computer vendors and it would be my bill
The tech supports people who got on the phones had an accent that was hard to understand and went through huge mood swings during the call from happy to argumentative to depressed to happy again
I was freaked that this person knew my home addresses
After reading up on it and now experiencing it I think it needs a tons more engineering and refinements before it is brought to market
It really requires a levels of technical expertises that is not there with the average consumers
everythings works fine except for two flaws in Excel on the numpad the minus key actually toggles shifts and the slash key acts as the alt key
this is unacceptable i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games
logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings
I live in San Francisco and have generally good radio reception
This units could not receive normal FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up
and I used the fancy Dipole antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna
Sometimes the audio skips and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired meaning 3 or 4 second dropouts
I purchased the Recepter Radio HD a years ago used it for a weekend and returned it immediately
Even in the Denver markets with lots of very strong HD signals this radios had trouble finding them
Id be listening to a strong stations and the radios would lose locks go silent and rebuffer before coming back to lives
This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it
I have since purchased a Sangean HDR1 and love it
Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista
Got this messages One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it
After one successful printing it didnt work at all
This cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected
What more can I say than the above It is flimsy doesnt stays in adjustments rattles around when you move and looks cheap to boot
Tilting the feet rests back and forths is not the easiest thing in the worlds
Its just cheap plastics rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lots
There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives
For me I consider them annoyances but not killers
I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it
More memories is always good but the T5 isnt on the hurting sides
Its not a good mp3 players with the memory it has
And even if you have a 2G card with mp3ss its not like this is what you would buy for MP3s
But as far as contact information on the go applications etc
The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die
I havent heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die
It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to even a factory state
You will have a Palm Powered logo screens with a small black line flashing on the top
If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make it better
This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for
Until I ran into this I would have rated this a 45
Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do
I read the boxes before buying it and knew it had some lacks of cool factors with the no WiFi
But it has one of the fastest processors available at that times in a PDAs
works well enough I havent had any issues with it
You can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isnts really that big of a deal
But if you cant trust your devices is going to be working the next days it really
I dont want to buy another Palms after this experience but I am not sure what to
First T5 lasted 6 months then just refused to start was replaced under warranty
This one locked up after about 3 months was replaced again under warranty
Its now out of warranty and wont start or reset
The first 2 times Palm told me the ROM had failed
I guess its the same problem again but Im not spending 169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5s
Out of the box I think its a good PDA so check those 4 and 5 stars reviews to see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy
I bought this headsets from retailer offline and returned it the next days
First off I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sounds
Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger they use 40mm drivers the sound quality of the headsets was just fine
However when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sins
The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kinds of decent seal around the ears and a bad seals on closedback headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolations
Also I have no idea what materials they used for the cup pads but it is nowhere near soft enough
in fact I litterally couldnt wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red flush from discomforts
Mind you I also own a cheap pairs of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no strangers to being cupped in speakers either
but these things they just plain hurt to wear after a very short periods of times which isnt good at all
Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return
If your ears are tough you should have no problem with this headsets
The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you
However if youres looking for comfort and good sound isolations youll want to look elsewhere
I dont recommend these for 1st people shooter gamers
Impossible to tell if enemy is in fronts or behind you
Probably ok if direction of sounds is not important to you
Left and right works ok but not frontrear for some reason
The uses of this AC powers adaptor has increased the amount of static to the points where using the radios with the adaptors is pointless
On battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptors and all reception is lost
I bought this cards and the Belkin PreN wirelesses router in Nov
Everytime they asked me to reinstall the drivers and software for the cards but the cards never worked
I wasted more than 4 hours on phones and reinstalling drivers again and again
Then finally Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacements
I pointed out that I should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shippings costs
I have shipped them the defective cards today and am awaiting a replacements to arrive
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th
I wouldnt waste my time ordering this products from Amazon
THIS SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE INK CARTRIDGE I NEED
Dear SirMadam Its very difficult to email you regarding things I cant find
Or you dont sell I am looking for HP black ink
Now you tell me which ink I need No way you can tell
Because you are NOT selling or what You sites is very difficult to find Ink I need
When the screens is black between scenes and what not their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interferences
Buy a different one this one is just not up to the task
I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedbacks on this pages
I didnt want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed as the other fellow did below
Amazon is usually pretty good not this times and not on this product
Now Im stucks with a antenna I did not order nor do I want
This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifers with the possible hose attachments that goes to a masks around my dads new tracheostomies
Problem is it puts out TOO much mists even at the lowest settings Weve tried everythings including taping the holes but it then goes from all to nothing because the small holes desired quickly coalesces water preventing steams from passing through
Of course it wasnt until we started mentioning it to the various RNs that come to take cares of my dads that everyones using it for the same purposes complains of the same excessive mists problem
Ive resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastics tubing leading up to my dads mask
Not a great way to do it and just asking to be seeded by bacteria but if anyone has a better suggestions Im all for it even if it means suggesting a different humidifier
so Im paying 300 for a settop box with a 40Gb hard drive but I cant use it as a DVR Why not Also the only content I can play on this settop boxes is content that comes through iTunes Thats right
if it isnt in your iTunes library you can play it on the Apple TV
This means you caqn play your DVDs you cantt play saved DVD iMovies or other movie files you cant play anything unless it has been successfullyy added to your iTunes library
Also make sure you see the fine prints about having to have a widescreen TV
If you dont have one you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screens it wont go to the edges and be borderless so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black boxes
Any pros It has to be the easiest setups I have ever experienced with an electronic items
also I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes just because I plugged the Apple TVs into my Airport Extreme router that my computers was also plugged into
I didnt think it would be that easy without having to configure somethings but it was
This will be a good product down the lines when this will have a larger hard drives and DVR capability
Right now its times to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better
if this had only cost me 100 or 150 I would probably keep it however
The left palms pads keep peeling possibly from the uneven heat
This make the protection pad a lots less useful than one would
The software on the pcs sides doesnts works well at all
Wont list all my files and I cant get it to update changes or new folders
The remote needs a skip functions to fast foward through movies
It continues to blow away any of the media players I have purchased
I read the other reviews some glowing others well
The prices was right 149 50 rebates So I thought I would take a chances
I read the other reviews so I have no ones else to blame but myself
First off I am only interested in playing videos from my computers so I have no ideas how well the image viewings or MP3 playings works
I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections
My house is fully wired with CAT5 therefores I am using this product wired not wireless
I was able to get the device connected to my network and readings files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton
It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed
Neither server tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie
So for examples I clicked on my Casablanca folder I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movies
When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes it did not go to VOB_2
I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play
As another reviews stated the FF simply does not work properly
Oh sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward
If you press play while the movies is FFwding the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB
This alones is enough of a nuisance to return the devices
Which I will be doing first things in the mornings
My final advice to any prospective buyers S T A Y A W A Y
My final advic to DLink Great idea but your products absolutely sucks
Oh one more thing Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly
Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly their English was terrible
oh come on just one guess It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another
I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients
Which made it very difficult for the ladies helping me
She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over
Sheesh I must have read my phones number to her at least 4 times before she got it right
One last interesting tidbit on the packaging they mention Nero recode CE
Nero has a lists of Supported Media Players listed
I will return this DLink junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead
I bow my head in shames As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway
It was a pains to configures and then none of the settings would stick
Whenever I changed the defaults passwords it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a resets
Returning this items so I can get somethings decent
bad customer services its been almost a month and i still have not received this products
ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anythings neither did anyones answer the phones
is dont even know how to rates the item because i dont have it
ims pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no helps
I put it into the cassettes player in my cars and the sounds were completely distorted
The voice constantly skips and the casette sometimes clicks
The qualities of sound in my cars is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device
I plan on returning it if shipping doesnt costs more than the products itself
I have a DCS900W cameras that failed within a years
After that I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced
Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that dont seem to care about the service that much and usually after a couple of transfers the line got cut off or picked up by another laymen
During conversations the line quality is very bad
After a whiles I just decided that 100 camera is not worth the time of the calls
I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better businesses bureaux
Based on my experiences I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from DLink
Once you have any problem they just wont honor the waranties
I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons
First I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt
That wasnt such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve
But then I went to wear it for a runs and the armband was too small for my arms I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight trainings but nothing outrageous
I would have thought that with a velcro straps there would have been enough ranges to accommodate most users
So if you have larger than average biceps say 17 amd up save your money
is bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness lt100
After having installed the units for 43 days the suction cups snapped off the plastics mounting
This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit Flying Very dangerous
Tomtom would not replace the unit as the claims that paarts is warranted only for 3 weeks buyers bewares
See the TomTom forums for descriptions and picture
I ordered this televisions with high hopes knowing that despite reports of firmwares problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle
Every Sharp Aquos LCD TVs manufactured before April 1 2006 shipped with bad firmware
For me it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TVs and turning it on it turned itself off and never turned back on again
Resets systems resets power cycling unplugging components didnt help
A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power managements problems almost immediately after purchases
For them the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the firmwares replaced or a physical replacements of boards inside the TVs
I say a visits because Sharp does not cover inhouse technician visits for TVs under 32 a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 weeks for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled
So here I am 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TVs to show for it
Instead it sits at the authorized service centers because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either
Im willing to bet all of the inventories of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fires sales prices were produced before 412006
Check the serial numbers on your TV if you do order one
If it begins with a 501512 601 602 or 603 immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp 1800BESHARP regardless of whether or not youre experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully while Sharps warranty is still in effect for you
i received my mp3s player with a big black spots in the middles of the screens i sent it back and it has been 23 months i havent heards anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit
It was great for the first week then it made my computers crash and now I can not get it installed again
I purchased this MP3 players thinking it was a good purchase
Creative Labs tends to have glitches whether it be computer hardwares software or other products like this one
Now having problems with the product is one thing but customer service is lousy and they could give a rat
Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their onlines stores they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month
My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months I did get it to work again
Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems
OK so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem no go
Oh and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the times so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phones
Save yourself some frustrations and get something better
iriver maybe Just stay away from Creative Lab products
I bought this Mp3 players because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it
It is a piece of junks that stopped working only after a couple months
The firmwares decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to
Now I have a 200 dollars mp3 players with no music on it that will not interface with my PCs
So if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great products
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies I have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was parts of the atraction of this cases note that the discription says sturdies padded handles NOT
5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you dont need one
no help from their support staff on phones nor online QA
I am a savvy computer types with network experiences and this one for the books
This product has a known defects for serial numbers R641 and less see Logitech websites
I just received my Amazon Order and it was serial number R635
Hopefully Amazon will cleanse its inventories on its own rather than relying on its customers base
These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out
Voices are muted highs are muddy and lows are nonexistant
The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as surrounds sound yeah right
they have an open diaphrams designs that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headsets and still hear my callers
Maybe mine was broken but I dont think so because I could see a red lights at all the cable ends
I connected the splitter to my sound cards a TB Montego DDL with a 1 cable and then tried both a 6 and 30 cable to my stereo
Both the 6 and 30 cables delivered great clean signals when plugged directly into the sounds cards
I even used only the 6 and 30 cables in cases the 1 was bad
I think you need to have either a very very strong signals from your source to use a passive splitters like this one or use a powered splitter
Cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic earcups but after a few months light use I lost sounds through one cup then the other
In general when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling units turned on
The batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself
Very disappointing but for the price this is hardly unexpected
I was happy with the noises canceling features not the best but definitely works
Great for airplane rides really helps cut out that background engines noises
My problems however with these headphones hwoever is the designs the first set i had brok near the earpieces hinges and was replaced by Targus cheers to them
the second sets broke too in a different places the deisgn of these just isnts very sturdy
Im gentle with my stuff too so either I had bad lucks wtwo defective units or theyre just not made well
It is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channels and the sound quality is poor
I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month
Amazon was great with sending a replacements in just two days before even getting the original backs
But the replacements models froze up after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refunds
To quote an email from Amazon regarding this product As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than
we originally thought we are not able to send another replacements
If only I could get it to print Not to mention when I turn it on it makes a god awful sounds like some thing is jammed
Ive tried over and over to try to print something
Ive checked my options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing
If your looking for a portible printer you have other options and I suggest using them
I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs
I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks so DVDs is your only sources of video entertainments
I have been trying to find a good cases that hold equal numbers of title books as it does DVDs
But that seems to be asking to much or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers you will have to buy more of the products to support your collection properly Then when you look at the furniture options everything seems to be made for functions and not styles at all they are generally pressboard P
I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions cause there is definately a markets out there that is waiting to be satisfied
This product will not fix your disc I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problems worse
I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctors
This is a poorly designed and manufactured products that does not work I wish someones would have told me this before I spent monies on it
I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1
The unit has a very cheap feel especially for the prices
I wasnt at all surprised when it stopped working
The PC software that you use to customize the touchscreens is crap
The touchscreens is very tedious to customize I write software for a livings and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen
I cant imagine the average consumers being able to customize this unit given the efforts that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PCs to the remotes
The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touches screen
Unless you are VERY comfortable with computers applications do not buy this unit
Aside from the touchscreens fagilities is not sensitive enough to the touches and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remotes
Did I mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months In short this products is crap
I might consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less
Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point
There is no points in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client
It would be similar to say allowing people to just access one web sites on the Internet
In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear routers with VPN capabilities on my homes networks
The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working
Added to my woes I cant tell you how often I saw the blue screen of death during my repeated software installdeinstall efforts
I am now returning both the routers and the client software as this is an unusable solution
Like other users have experienced this unit is no longer functional after 18 months
The wired base is still working but the wirelesses range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights
A few months into the new year I dropped it onto pavements and it broke
For 99 Garmin replaced it with a refurbished units which I consider a fair price
Unfortunately the refurb units couldnt play directions at full volumes so I returned it for another refurbs
This units fell off the windshield still in its cradle and it started making that frying sounds of short circuits
I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damages to the unit theyd looks at it under warranty
I had told the guy what happened so I was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it
Under all circumstances the reports you get back says the returned units was within specifications or words to that effects even though clearly not
Units will be returned with new software keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to register even though you already have
For some the mappings software on the M3 will appear crippled
It does not allow you to load waypoints Points of Interest and the like
On the first one every times I inserted the SD cards with maps Windows player or whatever its called would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes
The fourth one has a problems common to the first one The brightnesses resets itself randomly to zero
The first one left the powered brightnesses full on so you could give power and see to reset the batteries brightnesses to halves on but this one resets them both to zeroes
So you may think the units is not turning on but its on
If youre outside you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightnesses setting but if its dark you need a flashlight
The current one will do a hard resets if I start the cars with the units plugged into the lighters and sometimes when I put it in the cradle
This means I have to do the full new users routine
Touch the screens on the little plus signs to register the touches screen
Reset the times from Olathe Kansas to where I live
All contacts notes calendars and other information is lost
After Ive gone through the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where Im going but I cant load destinations from contacts as theyres gone so I have to type them all in by hands
If the batteries runs out of juices the units is dead
It forgets everything and I have to touch the screens where the plus signs are to register the screen
Reset the times from Olathe Kansas to where I live
All contacts notes calendars and other information is lost
I complained about this to support at Garmin and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothings about it
They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD cards where it will not be lost
So now I carry a cards with my detailed maps and a cards with my backups data
I did learn though that if the batteries runs down the backup programs is lost so you cant retrieve your data from the backup SD cards unless you have told the program to save as selfextracting archives
To restore I pop out the detailed maps SD card insert the backup card navigates to the File Explorer navigates to the SD card open the contents of the SD cards select the latest back up clicks through the restore procedure clicks to OK that it has finished just a minute or two with my small amount of data click to restart wait a long times for it to restart tap to get past the owners data screens enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map cards waits while it reads it then Im good to go
I cant do it while Im driving of courses so if the unit resets on its own I just go with the complete lacks of contacts and without the units knowing where Home is which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue
The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as I cant looks at the screens and out my windows and make immediate sense of where I am visavis the map
Im sure this is my shortcoming and I then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up which I cant do while driving
It also defaults to different displays for day and night
The nights displays uses a dark background and I have found that the menu for the Windows programs use a transparents backgrounds with black texts
So I cant read the menu selections against the darks display
And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose powers or the unit resets when I start the cars or sometimes when I put it in the cradles
On the contacts database the units assumes all phone numbers start with the areas code to Olathe Kansas
I have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the xxx xxxxxxx format even though they are longer and dont starts with an area codes
In the calendar if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zones I enter them at the times theyre scheduled
Then when I get there I have the options of choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the units assumes all times entered are for my original times zone
So I never use the visited times zones features and the units assumes Im still in my home zones wherever I may travel
I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no streets address but for which I have the latlong coordinates
I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out which loses the roads
On the whole the directions parts of the M3 is excellent
It gives good directions has reasonably up to dates maps and lets you find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your areas and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations
On the whole using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper
After a year of uses I cant put up with it anymore
Ill take Garmins word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmins fault but I cant put up with it anymore
Ill switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isnt Windowsbased and that doesnt completely lose its mind when the batteries runs down doesnt randomly do a hard reset doesnt randomly set the brightness to zero and doesnt assume all phone numbers start with the areas code to Olathe Kansas
Maybe another manufacturers will let me import POIs and waypoints from other peoples files
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I have Directv with HD 5 LNB and the signal was low
Signal was less than 60 for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no pictures while watching HD
The signal strength wasnts improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well
It didnt matter where I put them in relation to the dish and receivers
However I was removing the plastics tips which need to be changed every several months and the headphones broke
The company has only a oneyear warranty so I was outofluck
Again I thought the sound was great but for this price I would expect them to be more durable
Also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times
Just received radios yesterday and am returning radio todays Pluses
adequate LCD display and good illuminations while on AC adapter
However the volumes slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of 56 there is a BIG noticeable increases in volumenot good and while tuning shortwave bands every approxes 100Khz increments there appears to be a null areas where signal meters reads a signal received but quiet speakers
Also on FM if hands are near the radio the signal breaks upfor weaker signals not strong ones and compared to my Grundig 400PE which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hisses is bothersome the Eton E5 seems worse still I am returning this today and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead
Eton E5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if comparing it to another similar sizes radios and then comparing it to my Sony 2010
After about 3 months of light uses it is stuck in 45 rpms mode
I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the players to 33 rpms mode
Dont buy this pieces of garbage unless you like owning garbage in which case this is right your alley the Garbage Alley
I wouldnt even give this to a bum because I would feel bad about it
After buying this product I opened the case after few days as I was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices
However every times I put it in the cameras or other devices it gives errors and doesnt works
I couldnt use this memories stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receiptIs am not sure how I can even return it back either
Basically not at all happy with the products at this time
The light makes my computers very sluggish even when my laptops is not running off of the battery
Browsing the internets especially is painfully slow and I am on a highspeeds cable connection
After owning a Ptouch labelers for yearsI found the need for a more duable label than my M tape was providing
What a mistakes The only things well designed about this units is its abilty to waste more tapes than it uses If you print a label of any sizecount on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it At 20
00 a rollprepares to be screwed each time you push the print buttons
Then go find the scissors and cut the excess offso the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junks But cheer up you can push six buttonsevery timeto reduce the margins to narrow
This will reduce the waste to a half inches on ONE side of the labelands print two small dots on the other sidethiss will show you where to cut it with your scissorsto match the narrow side
Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY timeAnother great featureits will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of prints sizeso you will only print large print
I used to make lots of labelsand now I only make labels for VERY important items
And only when I am up to getting mads for doing so
I really wish amazons would allow us to give items a negative five stars You have been warned
While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features Ive especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets weve found it to be extremely unreliable
the screens on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of uses
the handsets go out of range when one takes them only a modest distances from the base even though we have the bases in the middle of our house the handsets dont work at the ends and our house is not that big
the handsets randomly become unregistered from the bases and have to be reset this has only become a problems in the past months
The issues weve had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone usually wed expect such a purchase to last longer than two years
I bought this phone for the great features and because Ive had good lucks with other Motorola products
The phones and answering machines are easy to set up but that is about the only redeemings qualities that they have
The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit
The only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base units which loses the answering machine settings
Ranges on the handsets is only mediocre I cant talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located
Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend not buying them
Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout house because Patricia wives in wheelchair and on oxygen 247
She could beep all phones in emergencies and I would hear
First sound terrible second after 1 months most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls third phones quite often in searching mode when picked up for uses
Entered houses to find wife unconcious and not breathing
SEARCHINGs Stopped CPR and ran to another rooms for different brands phones and called 911
Patricia DIED in spite of my and 911 personnels efforts
Looking for someone I hate to give these 5 phones my last Motorola products
There should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces
The page from which I ordered both pieces was unclear and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer
I had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the players
I know Ill be refunded the prices of the first changer
But by then the promotions they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished
I received the real changers a few days later but lost the speakers
I think Amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss
In general Ive been happy with Belkin accessories but this cables is the pits
It lasted less than a month I used it to connect my HDDVR cable box to my receivers
No crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent
I dont like to support the Monster Cable hype but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cables to replace this one
After using these radios two months I can say that batteries life is poor
Perhaps my batteries didnt come in good conditions
10 mile range is not true in a normal environment open seas or desert perhaps
After receiving this DRUM which was listed as having a 25000 yields capacities on 121106
Today 11507 my printers is giving me the same errors message DRUM NEAR END There was no indications when I purchased this product that it would be refurbished
The transmitters works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matters what you do
I knew better but I did it anyway thinking that it would be a good compromises we have IBM Dell and Toshiba laptops and a Sony Really Nice Monitor
No modem port not a surprises but would have been nice the videos displays is well you can see stuffs on the monitors
The mouse runs on a delay of 12 seconds and is unacceptable
I switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected
I tried 3 of these DVDRs nones of them worked errors in every burn
I used another brand to burn the sessions and it worked perfectly so it is definately a problems with these DVDRs and not with my burner
ive come to expect a decent levels of qualities when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse
the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser wont track right
i had to open the thing up and shave down parts of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didnt tests it well enough
unless your willing to do that skip this one it is not of the same qualities as the first generation microsoft optical mice
i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain points your robbing peter to pay pauls
typical Shouldnt have bought a generic memory Serves me right Anyway
I purchased this product and couldnt get it to work on a PCs laptops or pda cingular 8125
Not only does it not register in any SDMiniSD card readers but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cables that came with iPOD one fewer thing to carry
Well about six months after opening this item I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery
One of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore
I am disappointed but should have expected that for the 10 I spent
The principal benefits of this product is in the valuable lessons it teaches not to buy the lowest prices item without first taking a good looks at the products review
I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call
Ive decided to cut my losses and buy a different card
Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wears and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface
I just couldnt suggest anyone else spent 15 on a mousepads that isnt going to last them
I put this covers on immediately after I opened my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratch
Ive never had my iPod without the covers on it and have had it 3 weeks
I now have an iPod covered with distracting scratches on the screens
Have a second Generation ipods If so this is not the products for you
After buying my new green ipods I needed something to protect it so I bought the Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster
I tried but the only ways to fix it was to cut part of it off dont do this
I sugest making sure the product details includes the second generations
Do not order this item if you want a DVD players with a 5 inch screens
You will receive a small orange colored players with a 3
We had this printers less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam
We would get an errors messages and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short whiles
We finally ended up sending back the printers on their exchange programs after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor
The tech supports wanted us to install a free inks cartridges when I had already installed several before contacting them We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again
The ink cartridge is pooling inks under the cartridges rest area in a very heavy amount and the cartridges sliders again has begun to jam
Tech support has had us clean the plastics tapes that pulls the cartridge carriers back and forths and for now the units is working
We still havent addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem
I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally
I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years but my latest experiences has caused me to reexamine that positions
Also HP tech supports is very difficult to deal with at best
I talked to several overseas teches supports reps that spoke almost unintelligible English
I am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a products that is well supported
Easy setups but who cares when the ends results is a very slow video
Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movie The Mask
When he whips his heads from side to side and you see the blur THATS what you see with this webcam Dont wastes your monies
This suckers couldnt pick up a single channels not even one less than 10 miles away
The cases looks great and fits well but its nearly impossible to remove
I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pries for a long time
I was afraid of hurting both the cases and the iPods
In addition its too wide in the cases to dock in my Logitech speaker systems
I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking
Although the RS receivers doesnt have TV receptions who cares
it is 12 the price PLL digital 3 speakers DXLOC switch and
Bought it for my wives the pinks just didnt match anything in my wardrobe
She uses her players for the gym and treats it somewhat rough
This case doesnt protect the screen from scratches see most other reviews but it hasnt fallen off while shes worn it either
The only drawbacks to this cases is there is no screens protections
It is nice that it has a clip and it fits the mp3s players snugly but
Would be nice if it has a clear windows to protect the screens
According to SysInternals Process Explorer both HWI hardware interrupts and DPC deferred procedure calls tend to run to 340 each while this card is installed both drops to under 1 once its removed
Both remain under 1 while using another manufacturers USBbased 802
Im given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers but Ive found no useful driver update info on DLinks webs sites last I looked
That other bs adapters BTW gives better throughput than this bg card of DLinks
Does not consistently work I have a toshiba a15s Win XP Pro and sometimes this works but usually it doesnt
Lately it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screens errors and restarts the computers
It used to have problems where is would restart the computers and it would say card not found which forced me to reload the driver
But lately its just been giving me a blue screen
I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues
DLink needs to support their faulties product with a new drivers Bad customers service
I bought this mice while on the roads when I forgot my Microsoft wirelesses mice
I do not have the original packagings otherwise I would have taken in back
The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradles in the backs I often have to pry it out with a coins or a credits card
If the mice is left unattended for any lengths of times I can not seem to wake it up with any of the buttons
The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scroll
The really bad part is that it seems to behave this ways until I unplug the receiver
I thought this was because I was using a Mac I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well
Im going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemies
It looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
Overall this item works as expected but requires to be reset i
The ends are comming off this cable doesnt meet the normal Belkin standards
We got the hdmi cables but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the websites
The cables come without any packaging and there is no indications anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website
We have not yet used the cables yet and were not sure whether they will work or not
Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C the battery discharges quickly and wont take a full charges
The next steps was to do a hard resets of the Tungsten C and Im hoping it will take charges
It worked OK for 2 months but the KB kept on falling off
When I complained I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37s
Yet it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002
The worses came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working
I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC
Works fine on Windows XP but does not work well with Linux
Ive been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time and still had issues getting this cards to run under Linux
My built in 10100 NIC was much faster than this card would go
Ended up getting an Intel gigabits cards that of courses works with no issues
Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box
I just bought these to compare to my pairs of V20s and they just suck in comparisons
The Bass is non existent in comparison and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny
Any sorts of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortions
These look nice and are compact but the sound is not good at all
The fact that they are more expensive than the competitions is just appalling
I did not notice in the products descriptions that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computers
Since most new computers use USB for serial interfaces the usefulness of this unit is limited
My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product
The serial cables is hidden behind cardboards in the clamshells package
So you dont see it prior to opening the packages
Once the packages is opened it is a messes that probably can not be returned
Lastly this is one of the worst packagings jobs I have seen
The plastics clamshells is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors
Remote isnt very responsive and the displays is WAAaay too bright will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal people and the user interface is terrible
The things gets lousy receptions and in general there is a reasons why this is always the lower priced iPod types radios on websites
They are trying to get rid of it because it s_cks
I bought this alarms clock today April 7 2007 at Bed Bath and Beyond for 10
I bought it because of the product names small size and variety of options
Unfortunately I realized it wasnt a great buys when I brought it home
and spent a few hours trying to keep the batteries in a certain positions so the clocks would stay on
The connections appear to be very sensitive and the batteries doesnts stay in places
Its supposed to help you see the time in the dark but unless you have the clock at a certain angles everythings will appear blurries
Actually the screens is blurry in most positions even with the light off
If youre a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environments this is not the clock for you
Youll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear
A final notes on this product The clocks has been on for almost an hours without any problems
If I close the covers all the ways the clock shuts off
If you want an alarm clock that will last awhile I suggest buying somethings else
I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printers
Even though instructions from the manuals was followed the printers did not work
The customer supports is claimed to be 247 but no one has closed my helps desks tickets yet
So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response times
I tried several times to contact Sandisk including through the sellings vendor with absolutely no response
My wifes Cruzer just failed as well the power light comes on it is recognized by XPs and the lights goes out the system cant ID the device so its useless
It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our houses
Ive tried front sides USB connections rear connections and hub connections
And I was going to orders another 100 for the office
THANKS AMAZON BUT THE PHOTO DOESNT GIVE IT ANY CREDIT
THESE DONT COME WITH A PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO
WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
I ordered this items because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices all had the same description and specs
A friend with the same devices suggested checking the wire connections inside the cassettes which had come loose
Since then it has come loose twice more so I just dont uses it anymore
When it worked it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solutions
I just purchased this item now Im planning to return it tomorrow
One of the advertised features the ability to store liner notes just doesnt work properly
They just dont into the pockets without bending andors forcing them in
To me the liners notes have value and Im not willing to fold spindle or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
As soon as I received this radios I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up
The bases felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna bases broke inside the radios
I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right
I can not comment on the reception as the antenna is broken
Overall its a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials
Machine started making loud grindings noises when started or while printing
Showed it to a repairs shop says the fuser is a toast
Died just after one year so have to bear the expenses
Beware is searched the webs and looks like is am not the only ones with this problems
our MFC 8840DN worked fine until a paper jams inside the machines caused damage that couldnts be fixed by the sales technician
Lots of waiting for a responses from Brother at their calls in websites
Will never buy from Brother or Amazon again as a result of this
The buttons dont have that clicky buttons feel so you presses and youre like did it go
The labels are hard to read icons take a little figurings out
Honestly I use it for turning onoff and if I want to do anything else I go up to the iHomes to adjust it
My first and main complaint about this products is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPods Video
The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb and this case wont close around the 60gb iPod
A secondary complaint is that though the cases is sturdy and the foams linings will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks there is no protection for the screen
Its just a holes in the case like the hole for using the wheels and I just require more protection for my videos iPod
A third minor complaint is that theres a nonremovable knobs on the backs of the cases for attaching the belts clips and the knobs makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pockets
Im returning ours for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic cases that protects the screens too
I live in Washington DC so I generally get a signals when outdoors
Using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me
Now the good news they do get decent reception I tried them in my office in NYC which has a northern exposure and it got good receptions
I too experienced the Blue Screen of Death on my laptop which has XP pro on it
I had to uninstall the card software in orders to stop my system from continuously rebooting
On another notes the installs of the router was GREAT regardless
I didnt get anywhere with the Tech supports groups and had to return everythings
After printing just a few pictures the colors on the photo turns to pink and yellow
Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again
Not only does it not print many photos with a true color images but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of inks after a couple dozens photos
This printer has been a piece of garbage since the days I bought it
I dont know why I kept trying as the purchases was made about a year ago
It should have been thrown it in the trashes long ago and I would have cut my losses instead I did buy one more package of papers and ink
I have never gotten more than one picture in a rows without an errors message turning the printer off turning it back on doing that several times and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same days
Now it says the cartridge should be replaced when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures which would add up to the claims of 100 per cartridges
The ironic things is the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful
But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours
This is the last time I try to use the printer it is finally going in the trashes
com brought it homes and printed a photographs that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer my motherinlaws
The resulting photograp was horrible it had a very green tints to it
I then adjusted the various enhancements controls within the printers the green tints remained
I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual checkedcleaned the print heads and still the problem remained
Given that the products is still on the markets I suspect I had a broken unit
I have only had the batteries for a short times but they are working great
I have recharged all three sets 4 per set three times each
thats what taks to run my Canon PowerShotS2I2 cameraall good news
I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours
But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keep me in the fields for the day
I do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches
These batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet thats why I will be getting more
it says its an AV dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audios to my tv
what a wastes AV cables that sell for 20 are incredible
they sinply plug into the headphones jacks of my 80 gigs ipod and into the av inputs of my tvs
I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables
Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper
The Airport Express itself is fantastic but skip this accessories and go to your local Radio Shack for the miniRCAs cable and a quick searches online for the optical to mini
I dont like this mice is brought and never work its useles
Klear screens has to be the absolute worst products Ive ever used
I was stupid and used it on my primary displays first instead of using the 5050 isopropyls alcoholwaters mixes thats far superior to klear screen products
My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out
My 3 year old laptops display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 5050 solutions on it my 2001fp looks horrible now
I am using two other PhilipsMagnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better
This one does not look like the picture which looks more like the 425 models
It does not cover the equipment I have while the 425 models does Its learning modes is flaky and unreliable to say the least
Conclusions This would make for a nice ornament It does look nice and if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices
I bought this product to replace a previous HP allinones printers I had
This is by far the worst printers I have ever owned
It does not like photo paper it is unreliable and it goes through inks quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced
