When I tried to switch gel covers it comes with 3 different sizes the entire earpiece came off in my hands
The ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ear starts to really hurting from it
The sound quality is TERRIBLE People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300
What is worse people I am talking to heard me very poorly
They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar even when Im just sitting in my car
People can barely hear me over the background noise racket
Beware The Product Features for this product specified
I selected this model because of the advertised feature
I returned the item and was charged for the return shipping
I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product
In the online return process theres no option that states the return was a result of Amazon
Basically they falsely advertise so that you buy the product and when you discover its not the right one youre screwed
I now understand all those complaints Ive read about Amazon
Ill take the loss this time but I wont repeat my mistake and order from them again
This review is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon
I couldnt use the product so sorry I couldnt give a review about it
I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for 29
I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have
I see now you can no longer finds these for sale and gee I wonder why
I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic
and after only 8 uses a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well
While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in after a while you just gave up cause it doesnt work
com but have not tried to calls them yet and had no results with the emails
I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase
The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch
To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived
Mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working
I went through 2 of these in as many months the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working
People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldnt even distinguish between yes and no
Design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled
However after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece
I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic
The plastic used for this is not strong enough to took the stress
I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear its unobtrusive and light
However I constantly get complaints from whoever Im talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet
I have to speechifying up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset
The problem seems to aren't that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me
Its a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this
Also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrowing it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert
Sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end
Apparently you need to quotknowquot your technical specs Universal does not means Nokia so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesnt work with Nokia I get the expense of sending it back
This should aren't on the technical specs which are crap on this site
I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesnt work well sometimes it has connection bluetooth but most of the time it doesnt work
Yeah its a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one
I purchased a brand new Samsung t809 and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone
I went to a genuine TMobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good halfanhour they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit
The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit
after six weeks of hassling them over the issue the end result was that the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty
What End result I get to duct tape my battery in place
If youre going to spends serious money on a high end phone
go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product
I got this phone basically for free but even taking that into account Im pretty disappointed with the phone
This is my first Samsung and Im pretty sure my last one I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I betrayed it
From now I wouldnt gets anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe SonyEricsson
So here is a short list of those little things that make your life with this phone and its combination with TMobile annoying
its not really comfortable to openclose the slider and to making it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time
putting a comma while writing a text message capitalizes the next word what is the logic in that it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot
you can only saves 1 phone type for each category what if the person has 2 business phones
you can not choose the email address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an email address
And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through like it wouldve been in a Nokia even in a model 5 years old
Oh yeah and TMobile really contributed to the greatness of this phone removing some of the features and limiting others like setting your mp3 as a ringtone although there is an easy hack around it just change the extension from
I cant believe that with technology as advanced as it is Samsung could produce this giant POS
I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shutters my service off
I loved the clarity of the pictures even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy and I even liked the video feature
But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT Its been years since Ive had such lousy reception from a phone
Im considering taking the dealer to court over this since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was
Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for
Between the missing features no voice dial on a 200 phone crippled features I have to buy ringtones use their tzone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me wanting to paying the early cancellation fee and find another carrier
Anyone who would charging some much for this POS really doesnt deserving my business
Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone
They are incredibly cheaply made and when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call
Essentially unusable unless we find some trick that we have missed so far
I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk
They worked but never well for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit
I agree with most of the others it worked okay for a couple of months
now not only does it not charged my phone but if I plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charge Its also always falling out of the lighter plug
I dont have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets
Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr the phone complains that this an Unauthorized Charger and it will not charging the phone
When I plug the phone in it says Unauthorized Charger and refuses to charge at all
It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to am a charger
I give it one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars
I suppose that would be bad for business but it is what it is
Avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing
Maybe it works in China but not in North America
Have since bought a Motorolabrand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk
Do not isn't attracted by a cheap price tag because you get what you pay for or what you DONT pay for in this case
This razr car charger only worked for about 1 week then quit working
The Premium Vehicle Power Charger was not compatible
Motorola one is far better in quality as well to use
The product description should state that it does not work with the Verizon V3C When plugged in it states Unauthorized Charger and will not charged at all although if the battery is dead it will give you enough juice to speak but it still wont charge
These are not the same that come on the earbud and are not easy to use or to hears from
I had an old pair they were green that worked great but I lost one
Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds they split open all three pairs If youre planning on using these for your ipod headphones look into the older colored ones I believe theyre a different material and less prone to cracking
The service was good but the product didnt have enough info for me to makes a wise decision
At the end I couldnt use the product on my jabra ear piece
The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to helped makes a better purchasing choice
They did hold the buds in the ear better but no gain in sound quality
If you want the small and med Ill send them to you for shipping
I have ear gels before but none that were this cheap and I dont mean cost
There was no consistency in the size they come in different sizes but no two were the same
And without fail every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece
Every one It didnt seem to matters if they were small or larger or even larger than the ear piece
The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance
I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere
As others have mentioned the front window blanks out almost immediately and even worse it doesnt shows your missed calls
It does not hadn't any exterior lights such as my old Samsung that showed when it was charging when charge completed when a voice mail was waiting etc
While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute
No Im not driving but Im a passenger trying to use my phone
Cingular is a light pastel pink TMobile is magenta dark pink
The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band and if you travel interationally it will being great
I just got the phone so havent used it interational yet
Oh it must TMobile to gets international service
The phone has a camera plus other tech features but I dont use them
I want my phone only to be a phone no other gadgets
I would never buy this phone again and as soon as Im eligible for an upgrade this phone is history
I doubt I would got a Motorola ever again Ill stick to Samsung
Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call
not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off Then I would tried and start it again no go So I had to taking the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again
I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features except BETTER reception and an MP3 player
My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his
Ive always had perfectly serviceable but boring cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr I knew I wanted one
I saved my pennies and gave myself an endofschoolyear present
I have only had this phone for a month but I am horribly disappointed
It has horrible reception and I know its not the network because I tested it side by side with other tmobile phones and drops more than half of my calls
It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME in the middle of conversation while in your pocket whenever
I went back to tmobile and they are sending me a new Samsung but Im sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didnt live up to expectations
Sometimes It is the companys mistake and they still blame it on the customer
Since I started my plan I had a problem reciving my bill on time
So the company starting charging me 5 late fee for four consecutive months
Also when I tried adding additional features such as their textmessagebundle the change on the account did not take effect till two days later and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two daysand It costed me an additional 4
Every time I tried complaining to their customer services they just wouldnt listen
I am starting to getting the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit
More than once if I stay longenough on the line they put me on mute so they dont have to listen to my complaining
I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer
I had the worst customerservices experience with tmobile
Also the reception is not the best in the country
I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amount of money
I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for 29

I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer
I had the worst customerservices experience with tmobile
Also the reception is not the best in the country
I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amount of money
The product itself would have worked great if they included all the pieces
I then requested a cord and WebTreo said they would mail one to me immediately but none came
I emailed their customer service again and have received no response
The case blocks the camera eye and the clip lasted one week
Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design
The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective
The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove
The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove
The pocket stretches As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt like when you sit down or bump anything the connector easily and silently dislodges from its elastic pocket Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip
This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should am ashamed of
Ive only had it for 3 months the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used
The swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets
The cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera it has to am not held down away from the lense
Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers
I never got my order even after a month after I placed it
Ive previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for
A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes dont expire
I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone
It arrived however defective the port for recharging the phone was damaged
Per the STI Mobile web site I contacted them within 14 days to arranges for a replacement phone
This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service
In the first one the rep told me that I was mistaken and must hadn't been sent the wrong charger
No offer was made to replace the charger strangely which was included as part of the package deal
After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger I took the phone in to a local merchant who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective
At this point the rep apologized and told me I would hadn't to contacted Samsung for a replacement phone This entire process took several weeks
If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would haven't met my needs but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider
It rips off your battery door when you try to taking the phone off
Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytime I disconnect it from the holder
There are better holsters for the RAZR on the market
I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone except they sent me this flip phone V171
I liked my candy bar phone and didnt want this flip piece of junk
I was happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing and then things quickly went downhill
Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone even though I had minutes available on the old phone
I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phone which works awesome with no problems
She had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed even the local numbers
She also had problems trying to dialed a number and the phone would not dialed after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send
My recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service
Go shop Cingular for all the great deals they have
service is terrible no good ringtones my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates
Dont gets it You will ends up paying the same if you have a plan
I agree on it was too good to being true statement for this package
The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap
charger melted in the car after a sunny day I couldnt even test it
Earphone quality is not good as well giving a constant humming noise
The case and ear bud are fine but the car charger I was sent doesnt even fitted my Nokia 6230
Of course I wasnt expecting any name brand stuff here but at least I expected them to all work
I dont know if I got a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noise and therefore can not were used
The case I didnt need but it does fits well and looks to isn't decently constructed
I think Ill go spending some extra money and got a brand name earbudheadset though
I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala500 and used it all about maybe 5 times
Why such a short amount of time Because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in the car with the windows up and radio off
Its a bit too hot to drifting with air condition off and windows up just so the person on the other end can heard me
Now I keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power
If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere
The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone
Think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first
The one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone
As soon as I bought it I realized it doesnt holds the phone too well
Few days later my concerns proved them selves every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it even very carefully the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground
Every time I was lucky to realizes as soon as I droped it untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me
There goes a 200 phone lost because of a stupid 10 holster
Do not buy this product if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericssons ICE26 that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosnt slip out of the holster
As for me I gatta getting me a new phone shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it
It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo
The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons so I misfire applications
The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster
Do not placed the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to seen the inside of your pocket liner as it will not comes out cleanly
I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement however I was disappointed
While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment after the first day it looks like its two years old
If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it the belt clip will pop your card daily
And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt
Dont even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the nonslip cover wont began to slide into your pocket
If youre in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover but for the rest of us
Works pretty well with the unit but the belt clip SUCKS Its big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mutes or vise versa
I missed the reviews before I ordered I shouldnt have bought it
considering the quality of the headset I didnt even tries the car charger in the fear that it wouldnt follow the necessary battery charge cycle
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE I have had this phone for 6 months and I am SO disappointed Of course it worked for the first 30 days within the grace period but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged
I took it to the local Sprint store and they gave me a new battery
That worked for a few weeks but just recently Ive started having the same problem
I just spent over 2 hours on the phone of course not MY phoneI had to use my work time with Sprint and Sanyo
Of course neither company was willing to stand behind the product so now I have to sending the phone at my expense of course to Sanyo to having it repaired which will taking two weeks at least
So please do yourselves a favor and pick out a different phone
I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years
Just recently without any warning whatsoever they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account
pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time
Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever
I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered not only could they not do that but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me So my advice DONT TRUST SPRINT Again this happened with any warning It could happens to you too Trust me avoid Sprint at all costs I should has
the menu buttons are inconviently placed such as the My content and the address icon should had been switched around for better handling
its such a hassle to plugs in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone
Second and more important MY PHONE DOESNT WORK WITH IT ON The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone preventing any usage of the entire phone
It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily
I tried to cancel the order but they said it has been shipped
I was cancelling on October 13 2006 but the package labeled that it was shipped on October 17 2006
How can it aren't shipped 4 days after it was shipped
See other reviews on the problems w the leather case
I havent tried the handsfree device and probably wont bother but the case is cheap looking and the charger didnt work at all
As they say you get what you pay for Im going to an actual store and getting a real Motorola accessory kit
I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewers ear
I figured at this price Id try for my wife and I
When I first tried them on I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on
Even with the provided clip these fall out and youre better off not using them
Frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones
Two stars only because they do works if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive
Unfortunately the headset jack is not a standard jack but instead one unique to Samsung phones
Therefore you are forced to buy Samsungs headset
What makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord
Any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear
I hope that Samsung creates an adapter to fits in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones
I think this is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had
It just doesnt seem like its Nokia quality to me
I would gotten the Samsung slider if I could do it all over again
Battery life is subpar slider seems cheap and breakable speakerphone is not loud enough
The interface is pretty smooth but thats about it
If you have to had a simple interface then this might work but otherwise Id get the Samsung
I got this phone cause I thought it would been a nice little phone
Too little This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers
The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK It is hard to use
I returned the phone after only 2 DAYS I got the Samsung T629
Does almost everything the Nokia does but is better looks better performs much better
If you are a teenager this phone may is good for you
It was broken in a few days of use you should buys a hard cover instea
This headset is NOT compatible with the Nokia E62 The Nokia E62 has a 2
5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory
For 4 its not bad but within two weeks the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic looks horrible but if you dont caring how the case looks then this is the case for you
It also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to opened and makes the phone really hard to opening and then snaps off when you do
This case also hinders comunications maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line
This thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you dont ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo
Well I was wrongit was twenty dollars completely wasted
I could not gotten the thing to stay putting the boom mike is so bottomheavy that it wont stay close to my cheek even sitting still And it pokes out about 3 feet to the side of my head it seems like it anyway if I am moving around at all Almost like it was DESIGNED to getting as far away from my voice as possible
But even holding the stupid thing with my hand did not helping the sound quality
I got constant complaints that I could not be heard very well
There are only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating
Second its a decent quality just pisspoor design
And three I liked that when I clicked the button not due to incoming calling it automatically launched the voice dial menu so I could really making a call without ever touching my cell phone
I guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfr for both headset and phone
But it fails miserably at its primary design goal so I heartily recommending staying away from this product
Saw good deal for a bluetooth earpiece so I took it
The installation was a little tricky at first but once i got it paired with an LG Chocolate it was functional
Tested it out all over the house and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet
Used it driving and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels
This product alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF
When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things which it doesnt do they pointed out where it says may requisitioning 3rd party software for various uses
I just didnt know that the definition of various was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED
I would rate my experience with this seller as Dissapointing
At least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere
I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years
The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and shorted itself out
For some reason it only happens with the Palmtype cables
Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hotsynching andor charging daily
My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place so WATCH OUT and treated this cable nicely
I like the retracting cable concept but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant seeing anything in the outer window especially in the sun light
So you cant see whos calling or what time it is without opening the phone
Its my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Motorola should maintained consistency to keep loyal customers
Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Not to mentioned the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster
While it does allowed the phone to swivels thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead
Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement
Im shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak
While this is a functional holster be aware that you may liking me found that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster
You can turns off the answer phone when opened option but that is not preferred by everyone
You may also found that the phone does not stayed in the holster securely
I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would be a good company
I have never been treated so rudely by customer service people in my life
In multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twice
I ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money
Im writing a review for the first time because Ive never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience
I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts
It took them until December 19th to confirmed that they were being shipped It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items
Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products
Needless to say I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts
This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping which was very expensive to sent two little cell phone casesI cant specifying how much because they wont lettering me posting prices in reviews They also shipped them seperately
One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box
Ive decided to not return the items because I want to cutting my losses now and just never order from them again
Great concept protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches
The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint
Its very hard to get it off unless you wash it with water or use tape to peeling it off
The protective cover doesnt fit around the screen too well
Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right even if I try and reposition the unit itself
The plastic screen cover that can am not removed was already scratched due to the way it is packaged
Its now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust
My husband and I found these cases for our new SLVRs and were excited
Unfortunatly like others we have found that they dont fit our phones
We have the right style SLVR the case just doesnt fit
I purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr L7
The case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone
This phone case is the worse one ever for the TREO 650
Yea the color is great but if you just tapped it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit ease
You have to lift it up so now you have a piece of 2 cent plastic over a five hundred dollar phone
Now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screen to protect it
Quote It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover most cases dont have this if you drop the phone and cracks the screen youre hosed
Insurance If you invest in a five hundred dollar phone then you must have insurance on it
Final I am very disappointed in the cover and recommend that you invest in another product leather
I bought this item hoping to having something different
I really should haven't tough about this one and this is a warning to others
I bought three of these at once and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3
5mm headset for listening to music but they didnt handle calls at all everything is full of static listening and talking
I just placed a call with it and the person who answered immediately told me to calls back that the connection was terrible but it was the adapter that was the problem full of static and echo
It was functional it felt solid and it had a nice low profile look
However after around a year and a half the continued act of opening and closing the phone has caused the hinge to crack and to gradually breaking off completely
I now have to holding the phone together with my hand while I talk which is extremely awkward
This is especially frustrating given the rest of the phone is so well made
Furthermore it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my upgrade opportunity in a couple of months and right after my purchase of some extra accessories batterieschargers
Search around online for a670 hinge and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine
This in itself wouldnt be a problem if Samsung would willingly replaced the phone
However they are not claiming it as a design defect and neither Samsung nor Verizon are offering to replace it
Bad form for both although perhaps Verizon isnt as much to blames
I would avoid both Samsung and this phone because of this incident
This phone is seemingly designed to be durable but it frankly is not meant for the long haul and is too pricey given its average performance
It didnt have many features so its just a waste of your money
I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again
I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust
this battery is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670
when you put it in it reads bad battery on the screen and will go no further
I dont know about other company but Accessory Export will sells you the product that is totally different from the picture
I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3 but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic
Not only that the cover smells like petroleum oil
This is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of your phone
The outside is a faux leather made of plastic that looks convincing enough
Although the beltpocket clip held my Treo securely it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way
After a cople of days the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time
My old Tracfone quit working so I purchased a new one
Ive been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone
Its been a nightmareafter 4 weeks 3 new sim cards and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps Ive accomplished nothing
My phone is still not activated I still dont have my old number transfered and Ive wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps
Got it home put in the sim card added the battery and changed the phone
Once it was charged I went to activating the phone it said insert sim
I redid several times called support got the run around becaused it did not understand my error
When I got a person she said the same thing after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card the lady said they would have to sending me a new phone mind was broke
So we will saw if the new one is better next week when it comes
Weve had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year
When calling our son I would gets a message that his number was blacklisted
After calling Cingular several times we demanded new phones
We were told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing
If a phone doesnt work the company needs to get rid of them
I got the phone because it was small but I didnt knows Id be sacrificing so much
The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day
I get shoddy service and while i do like the design there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can seeing thru to the casing
All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but its not really the best for what youll want to done with your cell phone
I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards
The phone will said Insert SIM Card even if it is inside
It recyles and when it does so the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped
There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics ringtones and games
Save your money because you might ending up spending 4050 bucks on SIM cards and another 50 for a replacement phone
My wife and I got two of these phones for free when she switched to Cingular
After two weeks we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would frozen and dropped calls constantly
My phone was fine but has lately been experiencing the same issues
I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas
Sometimes Ill have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back
Even though it iswas free its not worth the frustration
I got this phone in January and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls
They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone
The one I have now isnt as bad as the first one but it still loses service and drops calls constantly
I thought Motorola StarTac my very first phone was bad wait till use this phone
First it keeps complaining to insert sim card although its inserted properly
Went to Cingular store got the new sim card works ok for a day
Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones
Now one of the two doesnt complain about the sim card but occationally it says its not in the network although it shows full bars
I just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but cant talk more than a minute
It just drops a call in the middle of conversation
I now am trying to getting a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it
I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to went what a nightmare
We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability no bells and whistles needed
Our major use was to communicating between each other
Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned
Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone
The major problems have included service not available even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location unable to read insert card and of course dropped calls
Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolves our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call
At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution
headset NOT COMPATIBLE with the Nokia 1100 Completely different connector type
Totally impractical this model smartphone is already fairly bulk this just makes it as lot more so
Even worse you can not attach it to your belt or pocket because there are no clips and or loops in the design
The construction is shoddy very bad quality leather made in China
The USB cable and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone purchased through Xcingular
The phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable
Uninstalled the software and tried again with firewall shut off
Connecting a USB device should NOT be this difficult
I bought this case to protecting the best bar phone on the market the Sony Ericsson W810I
Within 2 Days the case already started to cracked and chip
I dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case
The only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon
Bottom Line This case only protects against scratches
I was actually looking at the Clear Silicone Cases
my car adapter lasted for about a week and then it broke and my case riped on the 2 day
Unless you have a CD with a program that is specific to your phone this cable
First The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to isn't attached to the case with 4 screws
Third Only the case is black all other parts are clear plastic
Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each spent 35 dollars on shipping
Now i have to go thru the process of trying to gotten a full refund
However after about 3 weeks the duller not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to coming off
I was so disappointed I took it off and went with my original cover
It looks really bad and just looks like something Ive had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks
As you can tell from the item name this product should have been compatible with my phone
However when installing the cd you are asked to pick your phone from the list
Then I got a message saying it woulrd corrupt my computer if I continued to download
Howeverwho wants to send it back for a refund when you lose shipping and the shipping was as much as the item
Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity
After it had finished installing Windows XP came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could causes corruption with the operating system
The only support I received was to send me to a competitors homepage and trying to download their software
The software provided did not work and it did not include the VX8300 model There was no contact information for the manufacturer and I spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate driver plus I had to found software to use this thing
USB jack did not fit my phone and had to aren't dismantled and carved with a knife to squeezed it in it works now but has to aren't held in by hand
Came with no instructions and if you dont have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers you wont be able to figure this out
The driver CD is useless more or less since they dont send you a product number which is needed to access the menu on the CD
It works and I am able to send files to and from my phone but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer and a whole lot of cursing
I wont be ordering anything from them again and if I had it to do over Id order the cable from a different company
I was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own
but I had to locate the correct drivers on my own and its definitely not intuitive and definitely not plugandplay
Support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitors website to locates the drivers on my own
Also and with no offense intended if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you
It took a week and half to receive it 3 days to getting confirmation for the order only and they ship by regular mail
then theres a single protective screen precut in a plastic it doesnt cover well the whole screen surface its about 12 mm narrower and its very tough hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath I had to take it off immediately then once removed from place its a waste
I bought this and i have no clue how to syncing to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buying this usb cable i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics even though it is more its worth it
This cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting
It costs more to ship it back then it does to replacing it
I will chalking this up to you get what you pay for
The case fit well but only lasted me a few days before the top started to cracked apart
Im very gentle with my phone but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one
THe bottom is still on great but it dosnt don't me any good without a top
I ordered a threepiece set of an earpiece phone cover and car charger for my Motorola i860 phone
When I get the order the phone cover custom supposedly was too small for my phone
My earpiece worked temporarily then it started shocking me now it doesnt work
The only piece the one I didnt need that worked was the car charger
Net10 cell phones are great but dont buy this card
Net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards
I put the pin in my phone and did not receiving the minutes
I called technical support and received 1000 minutes
I was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that I will had to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system can not issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days
I put the multiclip on my belt and the spring metal bent out of shape
I found another clip from another cellphone which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also
This clip came with the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone
The second day that I had the case I lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasnt able to be fixed
I am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner
I would not buys this clip of you are going to was doing anything but sitting around at a desk
I dont know if it was just my clip or if all of them are made poorly
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant sees anything in the outer window especially in the sun light
So you cant see whos calling or what time it is without opening the phone
Its my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Motorola should maintain consistency to kept loyal customers
Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Excellent highres LCD but the rest of the phone was a disappointment
Poor overall interface with configuration options in nonintuitive locations
Particularly disappointing was how it handled WiFi
Each application seemed to want to isn't tied to a particular wireless source
So Id go home and tried to gets it on the wireless but Id have to bring up the app let it spinning a while am told it couldnt connect then Id have to tells it to use the local WiFi
The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone and a very expensive an bulky one at that
I can checks and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to get an appication running and connected via WiFi
Much better WiFi management is a must before Id consider this phone
This is a serious example of one device trying to don't everything and doing nothing very well
The device is relatively nice but I gave it two stars because a 500 price tag means it has to delivering
I wouldnt bought this unless its an emergency because its one of those chargers that reports errors and makes your phone start beeping nonstop when its done charging
I dont want this because I like charging at night the other chargers dont do this I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall like switching off when the battery is fully charged
so it beeps as if its being plugged in over and over
When I first got it I was trying to carefully plug it into my phoneand I didnt want to damaged the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger
It wasnt going in smoothly and it didnt matching up or seeming to fitted inside at ALL
So I went a day without a phone and I did more research to seeing why the heck theyd lie that it fit my phone
Finally I got fed up because I couldnt find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it
But it was charging so I was happy my cell is my only phone
Then I tried getting it out and couldnt figure it out I had to jimmy it off and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secured itself
I was able to put it back on and finally learned a routine so to speak for taking it off but its cheap
So the charger works but its very hard to use and it isnt convenient at all
This adapter was supposed to charge ww600i as listed but it did not even fitting it
Its totally false information being given for this item
cant belive Amazon has these untrustworthy merchants
This charger works but apparently not quite the way Sony Ericsson would liked it to
When using this charger my SE W300i often reports charging errors
This never happened with the original SE charger which my dog ate hence the new one
A very basic phone with not one good ringtone display or wallpaper
I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that werent working
Cant use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well
There are some nice things but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual
theres a composer in the phone to composing your own ringtone
First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it
The saving grace was the ability to sent the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet
I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when its in my purse
However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual
Counterbalanced by the ability to puts an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrating
I especially hated how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater
Youre being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise
Its only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing
Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons you get noisy tones as you lower the volume
I must lives on the edge of Cingulars and everyone elses coverage area
This phone cant hold a call at my house and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength
Part of the problem is the coverage area but part is the phone too
I have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem
If you live like I do in a pothole on the Information Superhighway avoid this phone
Im on my 3rd v180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it under warranty for another
Unfortunately they have the option of sending you a refurbished model which means that they tried to fixes someone elses problem phone and pawn it off on you
This one is going to gets flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy since Cingular says its now out of warranty and Im not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months
I had to change 4 phones in one year with cingular
I gave this one star because there is not an option for zero stars
Sim card does not store the full information on each contact and is therefore useless
Sim card failed after less than 1 month and had to are replaced
Foolish designer attached vibrator module to flat cable connecting base piece to hinged piece
The vibration causes the cable to delaminate and soon the vibrate doesnt work and eventually the screens fail and you have to order replacement phone
Less contact fuctionality of any of my previous phones ie
One of my 3 phones in a 8 month span failed after a fall of 10 onto the floor
I have to disassemble the phone and cleaning the microphone every month or so or no one can hear me talking
The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse
The car charger works so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package
One thing my boyfriend and I learned through this experience is to paying for known quality and performance in the long run you save money hassle and time
50 as I recall plus shipping I ordered the Bargaincell Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter
I suppose I could hasn't packaged it up and sent it back at a cost to me and probably received a replacement
But for the cost of the unit it was not worth my time
I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesnt work with it
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK It is suppose to making it so you can transferring data from cell phone to computer I wanted to taken my pictures from my phone and upload to computer
the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to gotten the driver off the disk that comes with it
I have tried on 2 different computer systems to makes it work
I dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is
The disk has 40 files on it I dont knows if one of the other drivers would work but I am very frustrated
I bought this battery to replace the original one that came with my cell phone
The new one holds a charge a shorter time than the old one does I have to charging it every day whether I use it or not
I only buy it because I must to has a battery backup for long trips and I cant wait for the seidios battery
Well the only good thing one can saying about the Treo 680 battery is that its thinner
The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day
As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 45 hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that come to minded are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable
Im really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy battery with the Treo 680
But happily there is a quick fix buy 12 more batteries and keeps them charged and dont leave home without them
Unlike the other review I can not recommending this at all
The GPS regularly takes at least 10 minutes to found satellites sometime longer the Palm needs to am not resynced bluetooth with the GPS at least once a month
The first time I tried to places the 7290 in the case it split at the seams
The battery was not accepted by my motoraola phone
Unfortunately I discovered it after the expiration of the Amazon return date
I bought this because my current battery would died after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge after sitting in a closet for a year
I was thrilled to get a battery that would makes my mobile phone truly mobile again
I opened it up put it in my phone tried to closed the battery cover and it would not close
If I forced it really hard I could got it to just closing over the latch but it was actually bending the plastic of the phone and the latch would probably aren't in danger of popping off at any moment
The battery is about 50 thicker than the standard battery for a Motorola v60
Might be great for the extra battery life but bad if you cant gotten get the battery cover on your phone
I give it two stars because the battery may work fine for all I know but it wont fit in a v60
but a belt clip is placed vertically making it obtursive and cumbersom
Although its listed under the accessories section for the V66 it is NOT for the V66
Well I guess it will work with just the phone but not the extra battery
No sense in having this if it doesnt charge the second battery
I checked it out on the Motorola site and in fact it is the wrong one
This charger is the Motorola SPN5029 which doesnt work with the V66 and 2nd battery
Before buying this phone from Amazon I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new
I subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and I am using it on the TMobile network
I now have a problem on the display within 2 months of purchase
I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech support they asked me to reading out my serial number
It starts with a HAGA which they indicate means that it has to be on the ATT Wireless Network
According to them I am in violation of the warranty since I am using it on the TMobile network
How am I know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my purchase If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network
Palm is taking the easy way out they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon
If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions please lettering me know
The price is high considering that there are newer models
This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon
com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working
When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then I called Tmobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset
I called back on satuday 02042006 Palm told me that I have to sends them the unit for repaire or pay 25 to getting a premium exchange option and that I would getting the unit in 2 to 3 business day
I called back on the following Wednesday palm said to waits untill Friday
Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday
I asked to be refunded my 25 because they lied on the terms the operator said that she could not
That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650
Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had
Ill spare you the details since theyve been documented well elsewhere
I will adds that After my 4th phone dying on me I decided to cancelled my service with Cingular which renders my locked phone a 400 paperweight
Ive gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS
Palm was a good company once now they have got their heads up their
Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now
I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years
IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited
The device can be used for phone calls calendars web browsing email IM ICQ AOL etc
internet radio stations document editing games modem for the laptop
So why only two stars and why poor execution Very poor voice call quality reported by many and totally unacceptable Luckily for me and some others one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution opening up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil
It worked but it should never had to be necessary
When you go to instal the driver youre supposed to select your phone from the list
Well it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete and my phone wasnt on there which probably means that yours wont is either
Dont wastes your time on this cable and just buying the music essentials kit that is actually made for this phone
The product arrived fine and on time from AccessoryOne
But the cable would not stayed connected in the USB port on my computer
I had to held it just right for the cable to stays connected
I threw this cable away and wound up buying Verizons Music Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600
The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver that work fine
Thanks God that the phone can survive a moderate fall
The case pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case its all loose after that
Another disappointment the circular knob that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing again you guessed it falls
1 Superior protection I have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case
2 All buttons accessible though a bit difficult to getting to in cases
1 Signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case
2 Belt clip useless since the case can easily opens spilling out the phone when on ones belt
3 Side ok button difficult to pressured same with top two front front buttons above start and ok buttons
Usable only for protection during transportation and does this well
When I recieved this item I had mixed emotions for the product
On one hand the black finish looked very nice and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to reading
Also all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reached with averagesized fingers except maybe the camera button so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard
However due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials the case is very thick and bulky when using the belt clip the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip but leans at an angle
BUT the deciding factor in my twostar rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 which at such a steep price is not something I like to drop
The problem lies with the snapshut system that closes the case
Because the metal is so thin it does not secure very well and can comes open pretty easily
To fix this I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone so that it was much harder to both open and closing the case
This for the most part solves the problem but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order
My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case
This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages
This is the only reason I did not give it a onestar rating
I am currently looking for a soft case preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pulling my phone out of off of my hip rather than bothering with a clip anymore
As a final warning BE CAREFUL if you buy this case
Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
You have to open it to slid out the full keyboard making it vulnerable to damaging
It doesnt matter whether you open the case or not
If it drops the case falls right open anyway spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protects the 8525 from
The case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it
The case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something and dropping everything on to the ground to aren't damaged at least thats what happened to me
Super disappointed in this product in case you couldnt told
My complaint about the belt clip it is made of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use
Please please dont buy this just by seeing the photos
It looks nice and great but practically this is a piece of junk
it makes buttons more deep down there by making inaccessible
The stylus grove is not good there by making stylus to project out and it will slipping
It opened and my fone hit the ground thrice and i cingular doesnt insure this instrument
It can not sustain the weight of the total phone with the case
Once i hook up this fone to the belt i dont want that my fone would twist and turning
and the worst of allwhen the flip faces downwardswhich happens by twist and turnsthe flip opens and cell fone hits ground wowowwww such a nice design to a piece of junk and hatted off to the lousy designer and I hate my self for buying this
The phone fits nicely but that latch is NOT secure
With in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hits the tile floor at a customers house
Tons of fun watching your 500 PDA hit the ground and the battery comes flying out
Phone is ok but the case is getting replaced ASAP
Originally I purchased this heavyduty case to protects my new expensive 8525
However wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up
Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged but I have several big dents and scratches on the case
Im going to stoppered using a case now since the phone is now already beatup
The latch mechanism for the cover will loosens up with use especially since youll have to opening and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen
Also it took a bit getting used to to hadn't to open the case to made a phone call
The overall quality of this case is very good tho because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons
I guess its a great case if you dont wears it on your belt
But I cant justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket
I dropped my Treo enough times to breaks it and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case
I have a LG VX5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with was a no go
Product would not instal from enclosed CD computer would not recognizing cell phone through enclosed USD cord
I have since ordered received and installed from another product Data Point from another vendor
Maybe its because this product is not approved for windows but I couldnt got it to installed
Yes the cable fits but the CD driver is just for the 8300
The cover doesnt fit snug with the phone the stitching broke after two weeks and the release button is triggered from the bottom
Today it fell off in a parking lot when i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car
This is a poor quality product and I wouldnt recommended it to anyone
Ive had a silicone case on my Treo 650 for a long time
It was thin and the rubber was very grippy great antislip once I left my Treo on top of my car NOT recommended and drove 10 miles and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived After it finally broke I ordered this one to replaces it
The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original case so much so that its difficult to use the 5way navigator without it doing what I didnt want it to doesn't
The case is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat unlike the original
Boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive since this isnt I probably wont bother
But in my opinion theres better products out there
These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia
With that being said the quality control can wasn't poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped
The software being aftermarket too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone
Despite what the descriptions say this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time
I ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life
After about 12 months of use the thing shorted out and wouldnt work any more
I decided to gotten another one because it was cheap and figured Id give it another chance
the thing didnt even work out of the box this time
spent the money on a Motorola brand charger instead
When I started charging my K750i it didnt charge at all no matter what
I bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a this model is listed in the description
First off the CD that comes with the data cable does not hadn't my phone model on it making it useless
I figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from Sony Ericssons website
After downloading the software and following the instructions to a TEE I was still unable to links up my computer with my phone
I even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case I made an error
All told this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with Amazon
However the generic LG driver software that comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesnt have an authenticity signature
I dont know about other computers but mine with Windows XP SP2 wont accept it
Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that Motorolas hardware was very good but that their software left a lot to been desired
Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came time to started a new cell plan
I had made the decision to switch to Tmobile and this looked like one of the best phone options
Right off the bat I found out that the people who criticized Motos software were right on the money
There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone not the least of which is the frankly idiotic way the phone book is designed
Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone
As time went by I started noticing that I was missing a lot of calls
The phone would weren't in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before
During the course of the last few months the phone is less than a year old Ive also found that it has begun crashing
Opening or closing it will result in a white screen of death
Putting it on the charger will cause it to switches back and forth between the messages that it is charging that it is unable to charge and that its SIM card can not be found after a few minutes of which it will simply shuts itself off
With a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off
At this point I am forced to concluded that this phone is an absolute piece of junk
I am also forced to conclude that it isnt the only model which is
None of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a Motorola phone
My wifes Motorola has shown its own host of problems
People working for Tmobile at several stores I have visited have confided that they never ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone
In fact Ive had Tmobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them but rather to shop for an unlocked Nokia online
Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every night restart it five or six times a day and kept apologizing to my friends family and employers for always missing their calls
The sound is low staticky and it frequently dropped calls
I was sold on the AAA battery power source because the rechargeable ones wont last on a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlet to recharge
However I have to says the audio output when adjusted to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler at highway speeds
The wind and engine noise is much higher than in a car and similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft
The advertisements criminally overstate the talk and standby time as well
With a regular new Duracell AAA battery I get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby
And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable battery I get only 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone
As for the marketing department at Motorolla I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated function and durability
I hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people
Hint Get a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecing society
After 18 months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life
Instead of updating to a newer phone accompanied by a new 2year service agreement I opted to purchased a new battery
Waste of money The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must recharge nightly
That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery nightly recharge
This battery was no better then the old battery it replaced
Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use
The headphone has a standard 8mm plug and wont work with the Katana
The software that comes with this is not the right software for the VX8500
Havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it
its not showing my phone on any of the software programs after i hook it up using the USB cable
the nokia bl4c battery i got is a counterfeit with fake number 0406040703000042032
It did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can
I had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit
When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip
I would no recommend this product to anyone even if it does costs a dollar
You will still needs to buy the AC cord for this unit
and i still havent been able to figure out how to use it
i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use
THis product seems to be a lot harder unless its the wrong data cable which it shouldnt isn't since its advertised as an EnV data cable
The first problem I encountered with this came right after I took it out of the box
Both connectors were covered by labels which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pulling them off
I spent about an hour just trying to gets them clean enough to use
Second problem came when I popped in the software disc
It turned out to be nothing more than a readme file linking me to drivers that didnt even work
I spent another 2030 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked
The cable itself worked fine after I managed to clean the connectors off find the appropriate drivers and download Windows Media Player
Be aware if you have a Chocolate with V5 firmware you wont am not able to use programs like BitPim with this cable
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON ALL CORNERS
I received this item and the blue illuminated cap is not present on this item
There is a less expensive product in the marketplace w a mere blue LED that looks similar and that product costs about 10 less Best Buy
While certainly this product works satisfactorily and the price is decent you should realizing that what youre going to getting is not what is pictured
Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a cell phone battery last longer than a month They refuse to refund or replaced
They are a shady company and Ill never do business with them again and will warn others to didn't the same
Ive had car chargers before for other cell phones and never experienced any problems
I was attracted to this one by the low cost but I guess you get what you pay for
It lasted for about two uses and then quitting altogether
The charger I got did not fitted the Motorola V188 wrong connecter
This product is not what its cracked up weren't if looking for a screen protector look elsewhere
I can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad
Waste of 10 and customer service wont respond to my email matter of fact email to customer service didnt ever deliver
Bought a cell phone battery that of course died one week past their returnrefund deadline
Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective
This company is a ripoff and will never doesn't business with them again
This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen
I attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughly between each attempt cleaning the Cingular screen with a new lens cloth
Once specks of dust touch the adhesive theyre there for good and the protector is ruined
I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoids Save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in
I have had to exchanged my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times Luckily I purchased the insurance
Im going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr this last phone only lasted a few weeks
The phone works fine then all of sudden one day 12 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the is on the screen and you cant get to anything
No phone numbers no voicemail no text messages nothing It is extremely frustrating
What is the point of a cute phone that doesnt work
i moved to miami and can not getting reception anywhere
it cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk
i had to getting a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i can not use it in my apartment so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates
but heres the thing other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem they actually gotten a couple bars of reception whereas i always have one or none at all
i returned the phone and all they could done was giving me another just like it
i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month
i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchases another one for full price
on top of that people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous
unless you never talk on it the battery wears out in a hurry
and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking
i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident
i am trying to deciding which is the lesser of two evils
chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one or wasting money on a land line
whatever you do dont got suckered in by its cute pink color because underneath its pretty exterior its junk
I got it because I needed a new phone it was only 40 bucks and its pink
Yesterday after charging the phone the ENTIRE night took it off the charger about 8am for work
I made a 5 minute phone call a 6 minute phone call entered a number into my contacts entered an event into my calendar received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping low battery
Remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago Thats what is here
The date and time dont continuously display on the outside screen
I dont have a clock in my office I have a very small office and work for a nonprofit and I dont wear a watch Im constantly opening my phone to see the time its ridiculous
I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am able to speechifies to them before the battery goes dead
If you want a cutesy phone and you speak for less than 10 minutes a day this is a great phone
After my Nextel phone started acting up I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr style and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the In calling was a bonus
I have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860
You can import only a couple of MP3s before the phones memory is full unless you buy their 50 transflash card 1 gig is the largest
Then you can not assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either a major disappointment for me again missing my i860 with its 400 ringtones that I imported from random WAV midi and MP3 files
You can not changed the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events you have to set a reminder for all there is no option for no reminder
All in all not what I grew accustomed to with my i860
Im already thinking the 175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what I will spending over the life of my 2year contract
And that leads me to another ripoff with Verizon they charge you an extra 35 to signed only a oneyear term Next time Ill read the fine print and just upgrades my Nextel
well im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it
first off it takes about eight seconds to cleared to the home screen and that takes forever the phone in general is slow
Im stuck with this phone for a while and am not to happy with it
I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY positive features
The viewing screen is so small that I cant even reads the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size
The battery dies about three hours after being charged even if I havent used the phone
It does not gave me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has Verizon service
I am forced to enters a code in order to heard my messages and I cant found any way change this
Holds the phone well for a few months untils the clips on the side loosen and break
After that happens the phone falls out pretty easily
and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a magnetic clasp
This is a very basic holster and often simple is best but not this time
The good news the 8700 slips right in and out with ease the swivel works great and the clip is reasonably secure
A minor issue becuase its plastic when the virbrate ring is active it makes an annoying rattle sound
The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs one on each side
Everyday use must weaken the plastic becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case which meant that they 8700 would not stays put
It slipped out and fell to the floor several times
I replaced the case and a month later the tabs on the new case broke too
Due to cheap build quality Id suggest you look at thirdparty case options instead of this one
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic
The reason I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call
I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better
I have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months
It used to weren't only 6 each so it didnt matter too much Nextel sells theirs for usually 1520
But if you are looking for a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replaces them feeling free to buying this item
Now that they have raised the price to 10 Ill probably not buy this anymore and got the better one at Nextel
I mean really how old is your phone Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired
The Liion batteries usually last around 18 months hence at 18mon a bunch of ipod users are gon na get pissy when the ipod doesnt work anymore and you cant change the battery
you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 hr on standby at first and then drop down to 4 hr on standby
Why have you noticed yet how hot that phone is running it is cooking its internal electronics your ear and the battery
when you get a new phone the new one will only haven't a 90day warranty
you will spending at least an hour with them on the phone
Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users this belt clip does not fit the phone
The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reaching far enough over the top of the phone to snapped into the lock groove
This item may being mislabeled and actually am not compatible with another Motorola phone but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530
that was great plug it in it didnt fit so wigle it in
i tryed again this time i grip the base tightly the base split in two
one more time this time the coper piece got smashed
I ordered a PC case that came in a box 1000 times larger then what this was shipped in for 10 dollar shipping but I ordered 5 of these for myself and co workers and shipping was 22 dollars
I purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone
My old battery would not hold a charge anymore so I wanted a new one
I dont think its a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead
Would not recommends ordering this if youre looking to replace an old one
I ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters
I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind not at all like the ones shown
The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pays to send them back
I never got an email about the substituation or response to my calls or email to the company
the other reviewer couldnt run much power through his splitter but thought it might are ok for cell phone chargers etc
I wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger so I thought great
The little light goes on but the radar detector doesnt go and the cell phone charger doesnt go
Ill probably take it apart andd see if I can rewire it
I really cant recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer
Theres nothing quotuniversalquot about this product
Itll split lightweight stuff like cell phones but dont trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter
I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second
Sadly Id bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop
The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps which seemed reasonable so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most so not only is this busted but they lie on the package
I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting it turns out even one of the springs inside couldnt handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melts plastic around it
I give this item two stars only because you might want to pluging in two cell phones simultaneously
I have had three of these during my two year contract I am trying to babied the last one enough until the end of the two years
Each has had the problem of powering down and rebooting without warning
The are billed as Milspec this or that but unless you keep it inside a purse get ready for many trips to the Sprint store
Motorola used to is THE name in communications but after this and my friends problems with the Razrs Im headed to Nokia
My office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract
No person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance
Battery life is terrible out of the box the interface is clunky and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance
If everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you it will gives you SOMETHING to complain about
For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your NextelSprint network contract
I have had nothing but problems with these phones
Each time I went to repairs it I had to be on a waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model
I would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later
Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging
They will not admitting these phones are pieces of crap
When I call I wait for an eternity througha million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them
The 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired
If this one goes Im canceling my Nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier
Ive had it Nextel and Motorola cant figure out that this phone is JUNK
My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service
When I went to getting a new phone a day before my contract expired I of course wanted to keeps my number
So as I went to get my Cingular phone highly recommended I had the old number switched to my new number
Today I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a 200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over
This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel
In my town not a small town by any means there are very few places that have any service
In the largest subdivision you can not gets service anywhere
I constantly get comments from people trying to reaching me that get the classic nextel line
Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located
Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls calls would go straight to my voice mail
Not only would I not gotten the calls but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later
When I did actually takes calls and call out I can not counting the number of times Ive had my call dropped
I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones
That brings me to the selling point of nextel the famed and wellloved direct connect feature
Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it
Even then in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore
Of course I would expect nothing less from the nextel network
If it did not taken hours to send or recieve a message it took days or maybe didnt even come at all
The internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked
Of course when you dont have service you dont gets the internet access either
I was constantly getting the message network not available
Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile
Trying to gets through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing
My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel
Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will aren't much happier in the end
My wife and I both got this phone at the same time
I chose it because it claims to be rugged and the price was right
Well we have had them for around six months and they are both not working right
My wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can changing the case so her i560 now wears pink
Shortly after it started resetting itself randomly
She would pick it up just to find that she needed to enters the SIM password
At first I believed that it might being due to damage done from the case change but later my phone started doing the same thing
Now my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day
I absolutely can not believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect
Anybody can ship one bad product but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable
I purchased 2 i560 phones one for me and one for my husband
Brand new out of the box 1 of them had a bad microphone you could heard the person talking but they couldnt hear you
Nextel Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days but I raised a stink and finally got it replaced since it was broke from day 1 I didnt want a serviced phone
Here we are 3 months later 1 of the phones has a bad microphone AGAIN and the other phones keypad just went bad
We dont mistreat these phones at all in fact we hardly ever use them
Motorolla Nextels warranty is also worthless we have to payed to ship our phones to Motorolla and we dont gotten them back for 15 days
I am stuck with a 2 year contract with Nextel the service has been horrible and the i560 phones are lemons junk I would NEVER buy a i560 phone again or use NEXTEL their service is terrible
And yes many times the person on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking aka drunk
I bought this phone at the same time I bought the i870
Ive dropped my i870 a couple of times and its fine
My husband dropped the rugged phone once and the antenna which sticks out like a thumb snapped off
Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards
What army DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE unless of course you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months
Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530 which I loved
I was at the end of a 2 year contract and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles and was excited about the color screen with the icons
Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well
I would have purchased one of those except I didnt really care about a camera for my phone and this one was reasonably priced
and I found out you get what you pay for The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750 i870 and even my old i530
I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls I could heard them but they couldnt hear me
A couple of times I had the screen go to Airplane Mode even when I hadnt touched it
The fact that you had to took the whole phone out to saw who is calling was another downside too
My previous phone had to been flipped open to saw who was calling but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it
When charging the phone it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight and to check that is says device attached it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly
Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working
Living in California apparently gives us an advantage 30 day risk free guarantee
Fortunately we were on day 12 and after 54 minutes one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order
Hoping the new one on its way works much better
I got this phone as part of a buyoneget one free promotion
I changed from Cingular because I couldnt stand my bill being constantly wrong
Within the first two months my phone already malfunctioned
While talking to my wife on the phone the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen
Next all I could hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key
The phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off
Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phone the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode
This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether
My wifes phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone
Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired
I was seconds away from ordering this charger for my Mothers V170
THANKS for the reviews you have saved me time money frustration for letting me know it wont work
I would have thought that amazon would haven't fix the problem that it did not fit v170
I bought my wife a brandnew v170 for her birthday
She wanted an extra charger to take to work so I bought this one
Big mistake It simply would not fits in the charger jack
Last night when my wife was cleaning the counter she threw it in the trash brandnew box and all
99 it wasnt even worth the trouble to try to return it
I saw the other review that said it didnt work for V173 but I bought this anyway for my V170
Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me
The jack doesnt fit in the hole of the phone on the Motorola V173
First the pros clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screen protecting them from wear
Fit is tight so the case takes up little additional space in my pocket
Now cons dirt and debris easily finds its way between the plastic and the phone
this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone
When I tried to remove the phone for cleaning the side of the case ripped
All in all I would not have bought this product again
I wanted to gave it only one star but maybe its a little better than the original
It still goes down by the end of the day and I dont like the bulge
My equipment is a Nokia 6225 I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional SP4 and Windows XP Pro and both dont works
They dont know the device and with the PC Suite of Nokia it is not connected either
I assumed that I would gets a DKU5 which is supposed to work according to the Nokia site
However I got a DKU2 which does indeed connect to my phone 6016i but is recognized by neither Win XP nor Linux
The part number should haven't been properly displayed somewhere
The packaging indicates that it is in fact Nokia part
If you are buying this to connected to a Nokia phone beware
It is a nonNokia part and will no easily interface with the Nokia software
It uses a different chipset than the Nokia data interface cable which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers
You may being able to getting it working but I have spent about four hours and have not met with success
I even installed the PL2303 serial driver but I could not make it worked
If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial port so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed
Youll save yourself some head aches and heart aches
The cord does connect to my phone but the computer does not register the phone
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wording that they use to describing it is incorrect
To me the words charge all at once means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall
This item is simply a method for organizing you devices
Although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34
99 I paid and if it wasnt a gift and Christmas wasnt 3
I feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
I was impatient to buying the successor of my beloved Treo 650 and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680
I have been a faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997 and for the first time I am disappointed
Of course I still have the friendly Palm OS tailor made for smart phones
I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15000 records stored in the Treos four main applications
But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands contrary to the 650 buttons are too close to each other
Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired especially compared with the 650 after firmware update
Finally I use Intellisync for dual sync with both userfriendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo Intellisync new version added a record number in the note field of all my records I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with MS Office 2007 compatibility
Nokias low blow to Palm It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own
The good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the Treo 650s interface that were clunky and it seems to crash less but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience so much so that I wish I had never upgraded to the 680
I upgraded to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems dont all Treo 650s suffer from that within a years usage and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems
I loved my Treo 650 anyway so I expected something equivalent to the 650 but what I got was a smartphone with quite a stupid battery life
I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card that is causing power to run right out of the phone in a sharp decline even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled
Add to this the fact that Palms websites online user group is not active right now so no users can visibly discuss this among themselvesand you dont have to think too long to concludes that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward when they recently dumped this cheaper smartphone on the market recently
Palm all I can says is pretty stupid and wonder if this was your last hurrah before exiting the smartphone market
When my Treo 270 died I bought a used 270 on Ebay
Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon
I called Palm tech support on issues I had with it dial up networking didnt work on internal browser with TMobile
Forgive me for saying it but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be
I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time did he think I was lying to him
He knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time
After a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to returns the 650
I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to given it a try
For me it was a huge mistake Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive
They expect you to study how to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface
Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use but cmon when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning I dont want to have to spending time learning and installing additional software for it to worked properly
Finally I give up on Pocket PC sold it on Ebay and giving Palm another try when I see the 680 come out
The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 as compared to the 650 and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm
Overall its a decent phone and I just feels way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC
Palm customer support is still useless and as others have mentioned the lack of a standard MiniUSB connector is simply inexcusable
Still Im much happier with PalmOS over Pocket PC
As I use it I see that the battery doesnt seem to last very long just over 2 hours of talktime at the most
I hesitantly call Palm support and gotten some flunkie again I decide to cutting my losses and stoppers wasting my time with their support
Im just going to buying a second battery and second charger to keeping the phone charged
I hate the idea of making such a compromise but for me its the lesser of two evils
The fact that Palm would releases a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset
As clunky as my Windows MDA was its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me even though the MDA has a much bigger screen
IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo
Most of the better designed smartphones on the market Samsung Motorola HTC Wizard are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used its clout to take over the market
I just wishing other manufacturers offered PalmOS based smartphones again this way youd get the intuitive interface of Palm without having to isn't limited to Palms poorly designed hardware
maybe its time I finally give the Blackberry a try
I love the way the phone looks and feels but thats about it
From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone Ive ever owned
Ive had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise
First let me say that I really wanted to like this device
I had patience and understanding for a while but it got me nowhere
The main issue with this phone is its operating system Windows Mobile 5
Simple things that should take a click or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just gives up
Connectivity with TMobile is horrible accessing the aim function doesnt work 9 times out of 10
I tried finding a solution for hours and the best I got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that
Internet explorer can NEVER find the page that Im looking for and consistently tells me to tried again
Let me tells you also that this device does not lets you choose between wifi and edge
If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE then it will continue to use EDGE unless you restart the phone with wifi enabled
Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smashes the phone on a daily basis
Usually I would press talk to dialed a call and it would immediately say Call Ended
Also when answering a call well trying to answer a call it would drop it as soon as I pressed talk
What the HELL is THAT What good is a phone if you cant makes or receive calls Keep in mind this happens around half the time
Also kept in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY My calls should not weren't dropping except for when Im in the subway
The side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation
Not only that but when you disable it you have no other method of changing the volume on the device
While the keyboard is basically easy to type on the phone is buggy
First off the t9 sucks It will completely change the word you are typing to a word thats in its dictionary while youre typing EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING Now get this you cant even permanently kept the t9 off
So you have to kept going into the menu to changes it to normal ABC mode
While I appreciate the ability to haven't faster typing isnt the whole point of a QWERTY being able to typified without using t9 When you actually get to typing sometimes the keys will stick and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it
This isnt a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue
For all you techno oriented people out there basically everyone buying this phone the programs this device has available for download are minuscule
Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a JAVA program which most programs are coded in the Dashs JAVA program will not allowances you to opening those programs
I ALWAYS get an error stating A Java midlet is not responding It then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app
I could going on and on about its issues but I really dont care to
While Tmobile customer support is very helpful and friendly their servicecoverage is nonexistent
Calls are constantly dropped I get voice mails without the phone even ringing and internet connectivity is never really available
Please did yourself a favor and wait for the iPhone
In summary Microsofts software and TMobiles service have ruined a brilliant design although with a couple of flaws from HTC
There are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to
I will break it down to Hardware Software and Cell Phone Service Provider
A lot has been written about this aspect of the device so Ill keeps this to a minimum The best form factor Ive ever seen
This device provides you the power of a Blackberry without the bulky hardware so I can puts it in my pocket comfortably and not having to looked like a geek with the belt holster
A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth WiFi and quadband connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset cruise web pages and have access to email when in the US or Europe
The keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails
The battery life is great when WiFi is not enabled and adequate when it is
Standby power management appears to be excellent
The display while a little small is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size
The camera is pretty good and its been really great emailing photos to people as Im traveling around
After all of the cons that youll read below youll wonder why I ever bought the device and why I still use it
TMobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device
It has great hardware that I can use in the US and Europe Im just hoping that Microsoft will finally getting it right
The touch sensitive volume button is the most illconceived feature Ive ever seen
Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level
Even worse when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hits the control and randomly change the volume
The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device
However the blame could well weren't laid at Microsofts door for writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications
Either way performance is very slow for some basic functions see below and Im afraid some of the blame needs to am laid at the choice of processor
When a call is on call waiting the phone fails to gave an option to the user to select which call to take and which call to putting on hold or dropignore
On the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is droppedkept appears random with a preference to switching to the incoming call no matter what is depressed
When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped
If the user presses anything other than the answer key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I have depressed the answer key
The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used
Even worse upon selection the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to opening
Now I have what some would call a large database of contacts but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not washes
The user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary as are all dialog windows on this device
One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock
The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness
The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged
First of all the user only gets to selected a time and if the alarm is on or off
From the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm
The best way to explains this buggy piece of software is with an example I set the alarm for 6am the next day the alarm goes off at 6am
That day I set the alarm for 7am the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am
The next day I set the alarm for 730am and you guessed it the alarm now goes off three times
The best that Ive been able to deduce of course this type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device is that the user has to actively selected off for the current setting before setting on for the new time
But there is no indication of what alarms are set so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loosing track of whats set and what isnt
the only way to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard reboot
If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should are fired
A calculator watch in the 80s had more sophisticated features
The user interface is so bad its hard to describe it in words
Microsoft truly does not understands how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that theyve inflicted upon us since Windows 95
Most features or function have to am navigated through the Start menu button
Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections
Some features are simply hard to found but should it really takes so many menu selections to find common tools or applications
The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous to put the device in Silent mode but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to waking you up for example does not work
Calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property
The only way around this is to cancelled reminders for all day events
So on my Nokia phone a thousand years ago when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I needed once landed
The phone would then automatically connecting to the provider available
It wasnt completely automatic but the user interaction was simple and intuitive
First of all TMobile doesnt help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to selected to enables international roaming
The feature is free so why not added a selection anyway All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone wont connect to the local network no matter what you do
Now assuming that you worked this out you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local providers network
On my Blackberry this was automatic but of course with Microsoft there are selections to making searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice
ActiveSync This is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not worked
Worse still when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization
It does not provided you with a fix a hint or a path so that you dont lose data
It does not even tell you the data that was lost
So Im using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook and they cant get that right OK it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft but come on
This was another primary purchasing driver for me
I am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA all the time
I thought that with the same provider of all the software Id be OK
Also as this feature has been around for over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry
There are probably annoying nits that I have with the software but those are the major ones
TMobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe
They have much better coverage over there than in the US where Im actually paying
Im in San Francisco and I have dead spots in my house
Their backend connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy
At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connection and emails cant am accessed
But you know theres nothing wrong with your connection because youve been on the browser
Also there was a whole day that emails were not accessible
Because of the many issues that Id had with email set up and maintaining a connection I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed
When I finally called technical support they told me that their service was down no apology no notification no nothing
Certainly no minutes to made up for the inconvenience
So why didnt I call technical support earlier read below
I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their help line
Im not going to gone into details as it would just take too long
Bottom line if you have a problem with your phone say Dash at the prompt and then asking for Tier Three Data support
Everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians youll encounter have inadequate training
If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial DO NOT DO IT This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to going back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device
So should you buy it Wait until Windows Mobile 6
Maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time
After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time tmobile continually wanted to blaming me did you puts it in fluorescent light did you puts it in the sun did you dropping it did you put it in your pocket and bend it did you puts it in your pocket and bump into something did you drop it did you break it did you do something bad to it they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money
The most amusing part of the conversation went like this would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will costs 15 When I responded that the ground would weren't fine she said OK that will be 9
Due the lower price of the charge I decide to buying it but it doesnt work on my Sony Ericson w300i at all bad inversio
ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN100 METROS DE ALCANCE Y SOLO PALABRAS NO SIRVE NO LA DEBUELVO PORQUE ME SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO DE LO QUE CUESTA ESTA PORQUERI
The external antenna is a plastic decoration only and does not do anything functional
Poor construction software that is difficult to install unable to run when installed and requires you to purchases a license to get a working copy
I encourage many to staying away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle
As soon as i got this thing out of its package i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction
The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is oknot the 100 meters that it claims as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the reception starts to fluctuated in and out every 2 minutes
This item was an absolute waste of money and Im all the more irritated for having purchased it
Upon attempting to merely inserting the device the outer case of the dongle split open
What I discovered That cute little antenna doesnt actually connect to anything Its just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side
When I finally managed to get the damn thing running the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pairconnect a device it worked fine once
I turned off my laptop removed the dongle and was amazed to discovered that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all
Shell out the extra 152030 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2
I am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to setting up
Instead I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plugandplay
The product works but the software that claims to am windows compatible says it is not when installing
They send it with another door for the backside because your current door wont fit over this huge battery
It is frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry and Amazon would foists this product on us
The battery is so big that the device will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holster
Every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card
The KRZR is a really cool looking phone but it has 2 huge issues a very short battery life 1 day and sllloooowwww reaction time push the menu key and WAIT for it to coming up
After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone I purchased
Here are the main issues I have found with this phone 1 The buttons are too small particularly the main control button
You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hitting too buttons at the same time
2 If you have quite a few contacts in your phone you will were irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact
You will notices that if you are not careful you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly so if this is you been aware
3 You must opens the cover and look inside to sees if you have missed a call or have a message
VERY INCONVENIENT There is no indication to showed this on the top screen only the inside screen
4 On occasion the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely
What you just needs to don't is power the phone down and they back up again
Not optimal and I probably just got a bad phone but I am just waiting for the situation to gotten more frequent so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola
NOTE I have no personal vendetta against Motorola but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing
Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you cant assign specifice ring tones to phone number
text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small
The back panel display is too small and hard to reading
I have the camera the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard
The reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public
It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub
Dont you find that strange Aside from that it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone cant remembers the model
This headset has a major flaw the connections between the headset and phone are full of static
The other parties dont hear it but their voice is constantly zapped by the static and Im asking them to repeating themselves
Ive compared it with a couple other headsets Ive got and they dont have this problem in the same locations
Actually this headset has static problems ANYWHERE office car out walking you name it
Ive used the headset for a little over a year and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the sound quality
Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance
Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed thatsince it was over the one year warranty my only option would aren't to purchases a new headset a huge price to paying for a piece that costs pennies
Logitechs concern for its customers appears to was nonexistant
I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller
I agree with others that after 3045 minutes it feels like your ear is in a vise
People say they can hear me just fine and I can hear them just fine
But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use
What good is that Then when the phone rings I dont hear it
This headset is uncomfortable to wears but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine
You can also going to an eyewear store and had them do it for you
I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can heard them just fine also
The volume is great and at times I have to turns it down in volume
Have tried the AnycomHS890 and this outperforms it hands down
Have had it dropped my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time
I would definitely reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment
Tried to changed the rating and seems like cant do that once the review is written
then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second
When this happens youre perfectly operating earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery
While its perfmance was good before the break the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of memory titanum or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste battery contains lithium I bet Skip by this one if youre smart
I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone Unlockeda month ago
I was hoping to gets the color that I saw on the web page
The phone that I received was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site
The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised
At nightin the lighting at night the top part of the phonethe part that flips open and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray
Needless to says I spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange
The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded
I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided but again they could not helping me
If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand and the color which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page
Incidentally this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it pink but Amazon calls it mauvethough the phone and the image shown do not match
So stays away from ordering this pretty mauve phone
all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted
I have never met anybody that has earholes big enough for these I even tried SuperGlue to putting the things that fit inside the ear That didnt work so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound talk sitting in the seat next to me
I dont know about you folks but I have small ears
Though the sound on these ear buds are good I cant keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because theyre too big for me and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears
Unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords
This product stopped working after about a week or two
lesson learned buy OEM products instead of cheap knockoff
I purchased this headset on 1232007 and received it on 1252007
However the RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1252007
When it works the next day it can not locate the offer number nor could this rebate isn't located from the manufacture
If you click on the URL link supplied by Amazon Rebate form you will be able to find the offer by Amazon order number however they will disconnect you in the next step saying session expired
Its a shame for Amazon to squeezes the last penny out of its customers
I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone which I love but this case is to snug for it
The slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to gotten out
Its a cute case I would loved to use if it was just a little larger
I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it
I bought this item at the end of January and received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to order another color and seeing if it does the same
They have the M610 listed so I took a chance but it will not charge the phone
00 50 of the sprint price however Sprint is out of stock right now
I am sure it is a great cable but it does not working for Apple computers
Samsung does not hasn't a driver that supports the cable and a mac
The company I ordered the cable from is great easy to working with but once again it does not working on a mac
I have repeated that it does not working on a mac multiple times because I want to made it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac
It did not fits my phone and I was forced to go out and but another one
I bought these adaptors to use regular head phones 3mm with my cell phone mp3 LG cu500 player
Once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound
It makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone
I have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level
They all have some type of flaw the volume wont get loud enough cord to shorts poor sound etc
The other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality
If you push the headphone jackmale all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker
You have to played with it and found the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers
I would returned this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort
5 mm jack is slightly too small creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active
I tried both adapters i bought the 2pack in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose
The adapter did not worked when plugged in to a samsung m500
The sound only came out of one ear when plugged in
The color of the product I received is nothing like the picture If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you
I bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges
Doh This crappy case broke within 3 weeks of use
I only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did
The little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time
Do not buy this POS unless you want to throws your money out
Also notice that this is not a Samsung OEM part
If you call to ask for tech support from Samsung they will told you they cant help you
The only positive thing I have to says is that getting a refund was fairly painless
I go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it
You had to haven't the product license number which i did not hasn't because apparently it was a burned copy
my advvice to you is not to buys this product but if you want to chance it you may be lucky
Cool Concept and everything but when I tried to install the driver my CDRom drive wouldnt even pick up that little CD
Bought this because Logitech has a great reputation with other products
I used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to is long enough
I actually went back to a Jabra wired unit until recently when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable has good battery life and the sound is better
One never keeps its charge pretty much from the time I bought it
the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime
The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and asks me to switch to a wired mic
Also its big and heavy compared to the motorola I own
Good sound nd price nicely connect with mobile however NOT WORK at all with my PC neither MAC
Once its connected with my moble they refuse to got in touch with any PC
they dont connect with 2 diveces in same time its OK but even if turn off my mobile nd renew all profile still its not changing
No Connection with MY PC so I was expecting use this for my Skype but NO WAY
The sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineering
Even wind didnt seem to bothers the headset much
The voice quality was great on transmission and reception
But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and cant is replaced
The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didnt want the hassle
I have a Scala now that Ive been using for months and Im very happy with it even though the sound and windimmunity doesnt measure up to the Logitech
Although this product is very nice I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect
To me the words charge all at once means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall
This item is simply a method for organizing you devices
Although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34
99 I paid and if it wasnt a gift and Christmas wasnt 3
I feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
In the ad this cable charger claims to syncing and charges but will not hotsync to my Treo
It will charging but I already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose
My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans
I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this site indicating the Pearl shipped hot with an active SIM which meant for those that like me were upgrading vs
new service their existing phone would stoppering working while the new phone was en route
To is fair that did NOT happened however I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accepted
The instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is inserts the SIM turn on the phone and it will works
And if it doesnt work it says dont call Cingular call Amazon
I followed the instructions phone didnt work I called Amazon at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS
I told him what I truly believe which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to telling me I have to waits 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone which is supposed to works out of the box isnt working
On a positive note I immediately called Cingular and they resolved the problem for me on the spot SIM was not activated in the system
Ive purchased this car charger for my Treo and the
connector that was supposing to went into my Treo 650 did
not fit too big so I wasnt able to connecting it and
when it arrived the cable did not listing my phone model number and the software listed all other models
and it never worked even messed up my phone a little
Too many options and I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out
I bought this product for my cell wich was listed on their description and it so happens that the software will not working they did not sent the drivers I would not doing business with this people again
this has not only been a waiste of money but also a waiste of time
Amazon should not permits them taken peoples money like that
Junk Sent with a CD that had a USB driver but wouldnt work on two different computers
Contacted the shipper Bargaincell but their only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed
The email stated emphatically that they dont provide support for the product
I bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer
The description stated that it would work for my selected model phone however it does NOT The software needed to download the pictures is not correct
When we called the customer services they were of no help they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem
Apparently I am not the only person to has this problem with the product
Again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate
This product is the worst of its kind It lasted a couple of months at the most it is not at all worth the price no matter how cheap
I picked one up at WalMart for ten bucks that works great dont waste your time on this one
It is cheap but dont be had stay away from this product
It fell in the toilet though and they didnt sold them anymore at the Virgin webstore so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store
It is awful with the poor sound quality short battery life horrible ringtones and worst of all I was unable to ever retrieved my voicemail Hello and it has the most horrible graphics
Does anyone want to bought it along with all the accessories It is barely used
So I looked on Ebay and found a used 8500 and bids on it won it and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610
I like the 8500s microsize simplicity ringtones animated graphics etc
I must be careful not to loses it or dropping it in the toilet again though
My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one but I can not get another replacement as I bought this one used
The pay as you go works fine for me as I do not wanting to had a cell phone clued to my head
I use it to check my land line for messages and for brief calls
This review is more about Virgin Mobil customer service than the phone
I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1222007 online thru Virgin Mobile
I called customer service and explained the problem
I replied that I could not tell if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please sending a new kit
I received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldnt charge
I called customer service and explained the issue and it must be the charger at fault
The rep said they would not send a new charger that I would have to purchasing one
I said this didnt make any sense according to the offer I could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charge I need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to gets a charger The support rep said yes and that I had to make up my mind either returning the phone or purchase a charger
The customer support rep kept going off line to talked to someone but refused or couldnt got a supervisor to talking to me
When I said I didnt know what an ESN number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the
Im not clear why she needed this since I havent activated the phone and I already referenced the order vmu number
At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile and at least she was trying to tracking down some info or so I thought she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldnt handled my order that I would had to calling back
I called back had to work my way thru the answering system and got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike
Mike explained that they couldnt send a charger none in stock and that I would have to sending the entire phone back which is what I am now doing 60 minutes after the initial call
I have to said that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive
They customer service staff is obviously poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions
The interfaces with support are youth geared not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally
I am sending the phone back for a refund and reconsidering the provider for payasyougo service
I replaced a Kyocera that I disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not beginning to make up for its problems
The menus are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and its hard to doing anything
The ringer speaker is inside the phone so when its closed its almost impossible to hear
I usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on I hate this phone and will been replacing it soon
I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VMs warranty was up and i had just purchased a 20 phone card had airtime credits which were not refundable
Now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receives harsh treatment
My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches whatsoever so i was pretty upset
After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they werent going to do anything to help
Obviously I didnt want the same one that could possibly dying on me after a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610
By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN when i called to activate the phonethey have the nerve to tells me that I couldve purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of 24
The fng idiotsHELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONERand after i spent 50 tax
the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here
Its so low that if its in my purse i cant even hear it WTF Also the battery life sucks no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half
It also doesnt get good service with the VMSprint network my slider had xcellent service wit despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls
So Ive had it 5 days and Im considering attempting to bring it back where I purchased it from
However i dont want to buy an expensive phone from VM because Im seriously reconsidering continuing wthem
The way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell they are expensive
I am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet wise
Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customer but not anymore
The phone may be fine but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile service never really worked
Perhaps it was the phones fault I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account
I had to file 4 investigations because they would closes them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right
I spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed
Now I have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service
I plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnecting the phone
I went with the TMobile Sidekick and already am way happier
This phone could quite possibly am the biggest piece of technology crap
Its useless the software on it is very cheap and childish
Not professional at all the camera is pitiful and the keys are too small for anyone who doesnt have 10yr old hands
Just because it has a qwerty keyboard that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash
Purchase a different phone this one is not worth it
Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a cell phone battery last longer than a month They refuse to refunded or replacing
They are a shady company and Ill never do business with them again and will warns others to does the same
Coming from the Blackberry 8700c this phone is a big disappointment
Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and Im stuck with it
All I can does is whining on the Internet so here it goes
Use the extended battery throw away the standard one
The keys are too small the 5way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally
Why do applications not quit when you end them Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager
The menu is preloaded with goodies to buy from Cingular how convenient
Grade C if you bother to learnt the shortcut keys
HELLO This is suppose to am an MP3 player right Somebody explain to me why this is OK
The phone works great reception is great speakerphone is great
Outlook email This is workable but difficult
You can written an email you can editing your schedule and tasks but its not easy
If Blackberry gets and A and it does Blackjack gets a C
It doesnt synch notes so if youre an Outlook Notes person youre just left out sorry
The camera seems to work fine although I may use it twice per year
In short if you really want to getting work done on your phone gets a Blackberry
If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice this could be the one for you
After owning 3 Blackberrys over the years I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory
Compared to the Blackberry the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome for me and was somewhat frustrating to sets up initially
On the plus side the Blackjack has good battery life the screen is excellent and it has the best reception Ive ever experienced
The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink ie the numbers began wearing off the keys
Its to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable especially when its backlit
I called Cingular first who passed me on the Samsung where after 2 hours on the phone I was told that my only option was to sent the phone my primary source of communication to their service center and 3 weeks
To my surprise they went on to said that at their discretion they might also charge me for the repair
Ive read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that Ive encountered this I do feel its worth considering
If youre thinking about a Blackjack I encourage you to be aware that for one the ink may inexplicably wore off the keys and that you may well am on your own when it comes to services
I feel that its reasonable to expecting a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right
You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to got it to retract
The wire is very thin so Im thinking it will not last long
I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and its nice to have one charging while Im using the otheryou dont have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone
So I also bought one of Boxwaves batteries for the 8525
Well the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine but it refuses to charged the battery that came with my 8525
This really limits its usability as an offline charging device
The cradle itself plugs into the USB port on the phone which was not designed with cradling in mind so its not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle
Since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone whos idea was that anyway it almost always gets pressed while Im wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle
This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station
Anyway just my opinion but its actually easier to connecting the standard USB charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle so Id recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard USB charger
If you really want to don't all charging offline you may needing to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one
I ordered 2 of those which never received and sell never replies emails
This case actually scratches and destroyed your pearl
The inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone
When I first received the items they didnt work and them I returned and had to spend more money and they still dont work
I even had the computer specialist at work try and they couldnt even get them to work
I sent them a email to receive my money back because I didnt want to keeping spending money to send items back that dont work back
I will never buy any from you again and will inform others to bewared
Im afraid the phone will fall off any second if I use it
After hours upon hours of trying to got this cable and software to work It eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time and then never worked again
The extra moneys worth paying to avoiding the headache
What a waste of 20 bucks The skin hinders the cameras functionality
A very small portion of the FlexiSkin blocks the camera lens thereby messing up the photos
I had to trimmed a portion of the skin away in order to take unobstructed pictures
Next it makes your otherwise superpimp phone look like a bulky piece of junk more akin to a ZachMorris style Nokia from 1993
Additionally The FlexiSkin actually TRAPS dust and other particles between the skin and the phone
This item blows in both functionality and aesthetics dont waste you money
First time when I plugged in the cell phone displayed error message that Charging Error removes immediately
I ordered this stylus to replace the one I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phone
I was so happy to see the package to arrives since using my finger or a pen is not an optimal way to work with this device
Sadly these replacement parts do not matches the factory specifications
These styluses do not fit into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out further than the manufacturer designed
This makes it easy for the stylus to fall out and does not create a smooth and clean design look for the phone with the replacement installed
If you are particular about these things you will not weren't satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised
I am disappointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that I received does not match the picture that was advertised
I am disapointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
The item did not work with my Tmobile MDA except in one ear bud
This has all of the features of the headset that came with my phone and it was much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from Tmobile
Brand new and I had to jiggle the cable near the plug to get it to working
In order to fits anyone but a newborn I had to pulled the earpieces apart which could have broken the wires if I werent careful and may tears further through wearing it
The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple
There are several places which Im worried will break soon through normal wear and tear
The ear pieces are hard plastic and look like theyll being uncomfortable if worn for a long time
The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music
Also be warned that shipping was listed as 5 for a 7 item when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 23 stamps
The cable is barely 3 feet long from mike to plugs so I dont recommended it for tall people
It will do until I can finding better but thats the best I can sa
No driver was included and no drivers are available online for this
None of the drivers that came with the package worked either
As for their return policy after a couple email exchanges they just sent me an address they did not commentates on paying for shipping or giving me any compensation
I dont want to wrap something up that I already paid shipping for when it was already an inexpensive item
i didnt got the car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it
It has a samsung logo but it looks fake after I bought it
The belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason
This product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
I guess you get what you pay for so I wasnt totally surprised that the battery didnt work
What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paid for it
Dont do business with these guys and dont buy this battery
I cant complain about shipping it was really fast
The 2nd time i plug it in the metal piece that plugs into the phone jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding it making a freakin paper weight
I ordered before brent birckheads review came up and I got taken
The correct internal dimension is 4 x 1 34 x 0
5 clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into
Considering that the seller enters the product dimensions as 4 ounces instead of the measurments one might suspects that this may not be an honest mistake
I think Amazon needs to taking better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly
All I want is a cable to syncing my phone and update software
Half of the time the computer fails to recognize the phone is connected
A motorola brand dataonly cable works just fine
I was warned not to invests in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened
The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers
Problem is the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connectingdisconnecting as mentioned above
This cord 10 30 for moto cord when you realize its junk
I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the original Palm Pilot and have loved them I think I had three different models over the years
I wanted a smart phone so I could check my email so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm product and so I could stay with my current mobile provider Cingular
Now I am counting the days until my 2 year commitment ends so I can punted this awful awful product
I may even bited the bullet and pay off my commitment early just so I can gotten rid of it
You must remember to stick this in a charger whenever you can
If you forget and leave it in your pocket overnight then it will am not dead the next day
I have turned off every thing I can find that sucks power and it still drains amazingly fast
It wont even last a day if you make very many calls
Ive had a Cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of So
With this phone I think you have to be right underneath an antenna to gotten a signal
I was on a conference call yesterday and got dropped twice
I am envious everytime I get in an elevator with someone who can talked on their cell phone because mine will freeze up any time I try that
The only way I have found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery and let it doing a hard reboot
The versa mail program that it came with from Cingular is hard to worked with
You must leaves your work computer on to check the corporate mail
That means if I am traveling with my computer the phones corporate mail program will not worked
I dont think the browser that comes with the phone will works with Java so I can not check my Yahoo mail either
I tried going back and forth to the preJava version of Yahoo and that is too much of a pain
I havent ever been able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software something that never happened when I upgraded before
It is hard to use on line so I guess I need to biting the bullet and print out the whole thing and then take a week of vacation to read it and saw if I can made any of these neat functions that I read about work
Hardly a week goes by that I dont actively thought how much I hate this phone
I actually signed on to Amazon today just to write this because the phone wasnt working properly today
Palm could not resolve all the issues associated with Treo
I bought this phone few days back and it freezes frequently
Ive had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular
Ive gone through 4 phones the same thing over and over
Never did they or I put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD card although right now its working and the card is not in it go figure
So I guess the options are not download things but have the phone work or download things onto my SD card and not has a phone
A slight warpage of back piece of my plastic case made
You wont knows if your case will fits until you try to puts it on
I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years
Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price I thought my fulfilled contract I am on month to month now meant I could qualifying for a new account and keeping my number
After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly I had to return it
It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 year customer I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would preferred the 750
It shipped via FEDEX on 32907 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3207
The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to delivered it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for
This was after Id already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving
FEDEXs response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded
For the 100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store
battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of the time
The product was sent with a plastic bag no manual not anything only the base and tha ac charger wall
When I tried it s not working neither the cradle neither the aditional battery charger
I got rid of the bulky i355s at the end of our contract and bought two of these for our account
We had to returning the first phone line1 within days of getting it as it would randomly shuttered off crash and other times the volume would fluctuated on its own
Exchanging it was an ordeal with Sprint they charged me for the replacement phone and still havent credited my account after two billing cycles
A few months later and now the second phone line2 is crashing
Other times it will shut off in the middle of the call
The other night I went to charge it and it said invalid battery so I took the battery out and put it back in
I might go back to the i355 it was rugged reliable but large phone
I guess Ill have to haggled with Motorola about getting this one fixedreplaced
How hard can it are shipped a cell phone carrying case instead of a charger
I owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
I can am not moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someone with no problems
It has far better sound quality than my backup which is a Jabra with no boom
The ear volume is adjustable on my phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont lettered them adjust the volume
As noted by another reviewer this headset does not come with any buttons or switches the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip
6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
The headset is very easy to slipped into my ear only takes 1 second and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to gotten a little sore
My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly stays on the phone longer than 2 hours its something to keep in mind
However it suits my needs just fine and for the low price I think its really a great buy
The sound is great and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear this is a first and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them
The device works fine and I dont feel I over paid
Sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable
My perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine
I higly recommend it over the other types of headset
i helped developed the danger hiptop aka tmobile sidekick and hated holding its bricklike nature to my head
the only problem is i hate earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics store and abusing their return policy bought one of every headset they had to tries 23 headsets to wasn't exact
i picked up the jabra only to am a completeist figuring there was no way id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear styling
but after trying them all the jabra was easily the best feeling and best fitting
in a nutshell here are the things i like about this unit in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the right and the left so you get a chance to get a much closer fit than some generic ear piece
contrary to what others have said here the ear pieces stay very snug in your ear if they dont youre not fitting them correctly
i wear glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic earonly jabra because it
lets people know youre talking on the phone and less likely to interrupt you while youre talking
i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and been heard without a ton of wind noise
its small and easy to wrap up into my cell case
also in the newest version theyve adding a securing lip to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a ball point pen for my troubles
using one with my hiptop is a joy it means i can still contruct smss type in emails add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone
if you have a data device of any kind this will make your phone experience twice as good
a truly great product from a company that knows how to treated its customers right
granted Ive only used one other it was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort
Where my friends would falling out of my ear this one once I got it figured out never comes loose
Second listening to people on my friends I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turns down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear moreso than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shaped as you can see in the picture and there are six of them total three of them for each ear
Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could I tried holding it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I95
And then one day somehow I came to the realization that you have to sorts of twist it into your ear with the little pokyout part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top of your ear if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
Matter o fact itll stay put so well that itll be a little bit difficult even painful to get out again
I can imagining that people with different ear sizes different patience levels and lower IQs might had different experiences than my own
But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out I was golden
I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly before youre good and practiced at it which may not sounds like a lot but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hears the first sentence they say or whatever
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answered the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and starting a conversation without missing a beat
In fact I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratches my ear or something
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with Nokia phones
In fact it even says right on the package that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone both of which claim to am Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt work with all Nokia phones
While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to are Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didnt include mine it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my model the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and letters me test both of them
The strange part of it was that we couldnt saw a visible difference in the two units
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to either know your phone well as in have the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to takes it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end
And living in windy Providence this is a bit of an annoyance
Also for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cutting out for seconds at a time so that I couldnt hear the person on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
Now for some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Im not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom
Either way its something buyers should am aware of
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost yeah Amazon but thats not why Im writing this review
Id like to talks about the performance and comfort of the Earboom
The eargel thingies are designed quite well of the three different sizes for each ear youre bound to find one that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt finds any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side
My wife had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comment on the fit during that activity but can saying the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed
Id have to imagines itd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place
Sound quality from the earbud is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity especially the higher frequencies
Normally this is not a problem but it can sometimes make the person youre talking to sounds like Isaac Hayes
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tuning into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse without having the voices washed over with background noise
The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrating on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear saying an ambulance while driving
There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths
Ive asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive my voice comes through loud and clear despite the booms apparent lack of length reinforcing my belief that size DOESNT matter
In fact I have found the mic to wasn't very sensitive to even small sounds
Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing theyll hear every click
Another example I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Even while driving they could hearing when I shifted gears
Not that its obtrusive to the other person on the phone its just good to is aware they can hears it all
Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommends this product
In fact I just ordered another it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not has to being listed because very clearly in BOLD letterswithin the titleit says 2
Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review
Ive been using my T809 since January and mostly loves it
1 There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens
Ive read that other people have this problem too
2 I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset they wont stay in my ears and because you cant hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music
3 The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume
If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings too quiet and by the time I realize Im getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket Ive usually missed the call
This sucks and I dont thinking theres a setting to disabling this feature
But Ill probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires
BTW if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone make sure you see it on the bill
I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying
TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance but fortunately Amazon exchanged it
Ive always stayed away from the flipslider phones because Im good at breaking things
Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong
You can check all the specs online and in other posts
The one I got my phone will slips out of it once in a while
If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it
If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset
if you do not known the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing dont bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that everyone should knew that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesnt have a chord
Are you kidding me Were going to sets up an EarGel Xchange Will this be domestic the Americas or are we going EnterGnashinAll with this PUPPY
Ok Ill do the web site were going to needs some fat pipe to handled the bandwidth for this one
Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture Distribution is going to be biggest problem here Im thinking we dont give UPS a look lets hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates
Its gamble but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those Johnny Gels come lately from jumping into arena
Ill go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community Ive got a 5 year nocompete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my bs over this they want 9 of the gross ad revenue from www
com but after we secure the venture capital Ill tell those jokers to take a hike
Allright lets get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelflife and the clock is ticking
If anyone knows of one can you please post that information here
These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery store
Of course they do not provides audiophile quality sound but theyre great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping
The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fits in any earbud holder while not in use
Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
My ears are a funny shape and I cant wear regular earbuds but when I add these gels they fit great and dont fall out
They block outside noise and making the sound quality like those expensive soundisolating earbuds
Sometimes I need a Small and sometimes I need a Medium depending on the day the weather and how long I use them
I gave the Large size to my boss and he loves them too so dont say you cant use all of the sizes guys
I do not needn't the large and medium and will isn't glad to give to anyone just for the postage
Tmobiles service may not being the best but I have had no problems with the phone itself
For all the people saying that it isnt really magentaIt is
The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink the tmobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown
I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades
Having had every new gadget imaginable I must reporting that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos I LOATHE having to charged the battery everyday Perhaps I just got a bad battery but Ive NEVER had to charge any phone daily
If youre a shutterbug like me you will loved this phone
I didnt even mention the hot pinkmagenta color which all gals love
One note of caution If you live in hurricane alley like me you may wants to carry a spare battery just in case they dont taking down the cell phone towers before the storm
It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people youre still among the living and need money to scaped the carnage
I have a TMobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months
In fact when I had issues with my first one TMobile replaced it
This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology
And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere
They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this
I personally dont minding the supposedly tedious software
Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone
It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual
Overally I will continue to stick wTMobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone
I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldnt be happier
I have had it for about a month and haven't had no problems at all
Tmobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
The device works fine and I dont feels I over paid
Sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable
My perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine
I higly recommend it over the other types of headset
i helped develops the danger hiptop aka tmobile sidekick and hated holding its bricklike nature to my head
the only problem is i hate earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
i went to the local superelectronics store and abusing their return policy bought one of every headset they had to try 23 headsets to was exact
i picked up the jabra only to be a completeist figuring there was no way id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear styling
but after trying them all the jabra was easily the best feeling and best fitting
in a nutshell here are the things i like about this unit in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the right and the left so you get a chance to get a much closer fit than some generic ear piece
contrary to what others have said here the ear pieces stay very snug in your ear if they dont youre not fitting them correctly
i wear glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic earonly jabra because it
lets people know youre talking on the phone and less likely to interrupts you while youre talking
i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and being heard without a ton of wind noise
its small and easy to wrap up into my cell case
also in the newest version theyve adding a securing lip to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a ball point pen for my troubles
using one with my hiptop is a joy it means i can still contruct smss type in emails add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone
if you have a data device of any kind this will made your phone experience twice as good
a truly great product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right
granted Ive only used one other it was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort
Where my friends would fallen out of my ear this one once I got it figured out never comes loose
Second listening to people on my friends I would have to turned up the sound to heard the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turned down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear moreso than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shaped as you can see in the picture and there are six of them total three of them for each ear
Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could I tried holding it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeats the purpose of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I95
And then one day somehow I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear with the little pokyout part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top of your ear if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
Matter o fact itll stay put so well that itll been a little bit difficult even painful to get out again
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patience levels and lower IQs might haven't different experiences than my own
But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out I was golden
I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to gotten in properly before youre good and practiced at it which may not sounds like a lot but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hearing the first sentence they say or whatever
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to got it just right and now I have it so that I can answering the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat
In fact I find this earpiece to were so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or something
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with Nokia phones
In fact it even says right on the package that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone both of which claim to are Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt work with all Nokia phones
While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didnt include mine it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my model the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and letters me testing both of them
The strange part of it was that we couldnt see a visible difference in the two units
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to either known your phone well as in have the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end
And living in windy Providence this is a bit of an annoyance
Also for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cuts out for seconds at a time so that I couldnt hear the person on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
Now for some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Im not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom
Either way its something buyers should be aware of
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost yeah Amazon but thats not why Im writing this review
Id like to talked about the performance and comfort of the Earboom
The eargel thingies are designed quite well of the three different sizes for each ear youre bound to find one that fits very comfortably
Turns out I couldnt find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side
My wife had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comment on the fit during that activity but can says the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed
Id have to imagine itd take a big hit to knocks it loose once in place
Sound quality from the earbud is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity especially the higher frequencies
Normally this is not a problem but it can sometimes made the person youre talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tuned into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse without having the voices washed over with background noise
The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to heard says an ambulance while driving
There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths
Ive asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive my voice comes through loud and clear despite the booms apparent lack of length reinforcing my belief that size DOESNT matter
In fact I have found the mic to were very sensitive to even small sounds
Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing theyll hear every click
Another example I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears
Not that its obtrusive to the other person on the phone its just good to am aware they can hearing it all
Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product
In fact I just ordered another it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letterswithin the titleit says 2

If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
Althought its not really the phones fault but BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hooks up my new phone to my new BMW
I owned one of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
I can being moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someone with no problems
It has far better sound quality than my backup which is a Jabra with no boom
The ear volume is adjustable on my phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont lettered them adjust the volume
As noted by another reviewer this headset does not come with any buttons or switches the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip
6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
The headset is very easy to slip into my ear only takes 1 second and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sore
My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly staying on the phone longer than 2 hours its something to keeping in mind
However it suits my needs just fine and for the low price I think its really a great buy
The sound is great and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear this is a first and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them
I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feels that you are wearing it
If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset

I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all
Tmobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
Sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feeling
Some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but its still red which is nice
I will probably get another color on it for spring
The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually asks me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different
Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m
I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot
Black leather blue piping going around the edge
The blue is that vivid color that one of those exoticexpensive fish tank fish have neons or tetras Whichever it is it is very sharp looking
It does not added much bulksizeweight to the phone
When I am taking a photo I simply unsnap the half that is on the flipup half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is taken the photo and slip it back on
Before I used to know about this I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way like a wayward lock of hair
Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary
They designed it so you can just removing that half of the case taken photos and snap it back on
In fact the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily removed the other half
Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it guys
Its a snap Snaps unsnap that is what they are for
It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand
I can easily pivoted it around in my hand flip it around pick it up and basically not expecting it to skid around
Without the Glove you have a bare metal or plastic case
Smooth looking and well maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars
I think it is at the bottom not at the back the way some people have said but I can not remember for certain
I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet
The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s
With the glove on I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily
Ive dropped it many times and this case protected it like I wanted
Having room for the extended battery is great too because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone
Was received in a timely manner however the picture online was not what I expected
For the price I really thought it was a little cheap looking in person
As it was a gift I was somewhat disappointed in the quality
This headseat is pretty neat when youre on the road or just relaxing between work
It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pauseplay and answerhangup features
The comfort of the ear budds could are a little better but the stereo sound is great
The only area of improvement would be the belt clip
I Really like this phone the camera quality the software everything is excellent
Unfortunately you could not use some of these features in the U
One thing I do not understanding why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price
The phone gets 5 stars but the retailers price gets 2 stars
I will keeping this short and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned
Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear
Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model the photos are much better both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses but this is 3
Also the N73 covers all radio bands making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere supposedly two internal antennae
The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular so depending on the city I was in I occasionally had very spotty coverage
The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90 and best of all it is much more compact than the N90 fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket
Last there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone protecting the camera lense why arent they all like this
As usual the flash isnt the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds
its 12 cents per minute which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost
Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when Im in transit and feels that I simply must knew where they are and what they are doing
I dont use cell phones much but if I must having one I might as well have one that doesnt make me worries about another huge bill
For kids who think they can mangle the budget forget it cuz when the card is used up thats it kiddo
Once they use up the card the only number they can dial is 911 but thats it
Bonus features clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to worked and another to told me when to gone home at the end of the day
At some point I might not be able to live without this
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not got it on perfectly the first time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good
This is the state of the art for screen protectors
And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will gets dulled and scratched
Because of the thickness and quality of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
I was completely satisfied with the phone clip I purchased
I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND
I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN
I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE
I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON
Ive been using this phone with the Net10 service since March and have to say I am very happy with it
I dont use a cell phone very often so this was the most economical way for me to go
Although the phone doesnt have all the bells and whistles like other phones have
Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER
I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare
I got better ringtones online and still waiting to seeing about wallpaper
OverallI would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week
The service has been good and the features are easy to use
The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phone will last
The flip part is a little weak but we will have to see
It was really easy to add minutes and you can don't it right from your Net10 phone
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to is
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increasing the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to typing
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does didn't what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not kept it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to removes these somehow
After buying the new LG Chocolate I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it
I searched the Internet and found this one to be the best value
When I first got this it did not looks like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as I opened the package and put my phone in it I could tell it was a perfect fit
I really like the clear window which I did not hadn't on my previous case now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to took it out of the case every time
Wind noice no problem user friendly coustomer support for Cardo is great
My only complaint and consequently the 4star rating is that sometimes I dont hear the Blackberry or feel the vibration
Apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the OEM plastic holster
I have had 2 Zire models and managed to breaking both screens
My dislike is that I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer forms fitting
I have tried to get info on how to shrink it to isn't tight again to no avail
As for the SD card issue I remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allowanced room for the card to clearly eject
To keeping from having to take the skin off to resetting my treo I drilled a hole in the back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes
The skin is very useful but can be improved on ways to putting it on and takes it off
Im not really a gadget guy and what gadgets I do having getting pretty beat up
When the company gave me a Treo 650 so I can staying in touch I needed to at least take care of the thing
Im a minimalist and for that the Treo 650 Skin is perfect A cool look not bulky
Iam very pleased with this item I purchased it for my son
00 battery and I thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting
I replaced my new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ
Just gotten this battery and you will not hadn't my problems
This item works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
The only problem is that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to falling off
When I bought my Motorola V220 my Cingular Store charged top dollar for the car charger and they were sold out
I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon
The car charger is compatible with the V220 and it comes with case and handsfree ear bud all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone
The ear bud does not haven't the best sound voices come across as somewhat muffled though still audible and the case is adequate
I wouldnt buy this set specifically for those items although they both work withfit the V220
As I see it they were bonuses for purchasing the charger
The product is compact and convenient but it feels flimsy
The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TXso it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX
For some reason the cable wont letters me charge using the USB wallcharger I got for my wifes iPod but it does charged the TX off my computers USB port which is a Powerbook G4notorious for being underpowered
Great reception great volume controls easy to use
To the reviewer who said too thin well dont gets the thin phone then
Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra plug in even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones
Were in our late 20searly 30s and just dig the phone
One issue DH has the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into bottom of the phone and when he is on speaker phone he tends to held it there and it sometimes can made your bars go down
That is it and all you have to does is readjust the way you hold the phone
its cute its little its perfect for a young woman
I had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call
I wanted something simple that wasnt an mp3 player i have an ipod that wasnt a professional camera i have a nice digital cam or a pda i have a palm tx
although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth but im not sure if its the headset or the phone
almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse
im grown accustomed to listening for the vibrate feature instead
i like how you can putting a persons picture next to their name in your contact list
i can worn it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable
I have trouble to buy from Bestbuy but I ordered it from amazon cheapest price and good product Thanks
The item by itself is perfect to protects the phone from Scratches it fits like a glove really nice the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of use it wasnt hit or treated carelessly
Ill order some more because they are really cheap and its better to had a cracked cover than a broken phone
Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it
The only complaint is that the case open easily if its dropped or handled in a rough way
Clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that
My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it
The case still does not hasn't a chip or crack on it
it covers all of it so you dont need those plastic screen covers
I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and they last about sixtwelve months
I bought this one and it is much more solid of construction shorter cord and a better angle to the power adapter
i bought two of these for less than the cost of one from Sprint
My wife carries hers in her purse while I just keeps mine in my car
This is the best car charger for the Treo and I have had Treos for about 6 years
i like the catch that holds it on the belt to keeping it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far
The handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it
If you buy this phone it WILL last you a long time
with my phone I know that sounds absurd but its true
Originally I had suggested a friend to upgraded their handset to getting this one seeing how I had already done so with the Motorola V3T
Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorolas V3T RAZR handsets both for having them freeze at startup I called customer service and told em I wanted this handset instead
With a minor contract extensionhandset upgrade I was glad I made the switch to NOKIA
Ive only had it for 24 hours and Im totally satisfied with it
Below is a list of pros and cons for you to consider
MP3ringtones enabled make sure to cuts your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so
Pretty fast charge even while messing around with it
Bluetooth and infraredenabled making for quick file transfers
Date can am enabled on screen which the V3T lacks
Comes with headphone jack adapter which enables use of any standard headphone that you may hadn't
Vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges by default
Power button is somewhat small and difficult to executes
FM radio plays with static this may varied by area
As you can see the pros outweight the cons with this one so give it at try
Also if you decide that its not for you return it to TMobile within 14 business days of your purchase and gets a full refund
As for me I wont returning it because its definitely a keeper
I purchased this phone to replaced my land line and have not been disappointed
I havent used all the functions yet downloading music but havent had any problems with anything else
2Good Volume ringer volume is loud enough and I can hear callers just fining
1No shortcut to gotten to main menu have to keeps pressing back button
2Battery access its really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and SIM cardcould be a good thing though
3OnOff Button its very smallbasically have to use my fingernail
I got a chance to plays with one of these last week
The external speaker is very loud the controls are easy to use and best of all it comes with a 1GB card
My only gripe is the slide feels a little loose I felt like I was always going to opening it up by mistake
All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capabilitysoftware is a lot better than my KRZR
I purchased this Nokia 5300 Black at the TMobile store
It does come with 1 GB memory card and I was able to easily loaded up 160 songs last night with no problems
Phone comes with USB cable to connect to your computer
You will not be able to download songs bought from iTunes but you can loading up AAC files and mp3 and mp4
I wasnt able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook but I was able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car
Apple has not approved the Nokia 5300 yet to syncs
I am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new
Overall I love the feel of this phone has wonderful 2 in screen color is great camera is cool and it is very intuitive to use
I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia
However the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned
Once you load up your songs the speaker is impressive
This morning I had the phone playing music in one part of the house and I had to go gotten something at the other end of the house and I could still hear the music perfectly
I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of peoplebackground noise and I was able to carrying on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my Samsung that was difficult to do this with
And I am happy to have a phone that not everyone has a Motorola Razor
This Nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but I feel like I have a very unique phone that is more than a phone
Who needs an iPod mini when you can got this and your phone all in one
I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone
There is very little to chose from at the TMobile store as far as accessories and Nokia
You can chooses to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increasing the volume of the song for your alarm
You can make calls without even having to slid the phone to dial
As long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book then all you have to do is look up and press the green button
When you are playing your music if an incoming call comes in it will stop playing the song and then alerts you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in
Once you are done with the phone call you can resume playing your music
As I said this phone is a gem in all areas speaker sturdy colorful I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing call quality is great even in loud areas and lots of little creature comforts
Definitely consider this phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone
I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part
The first thing youll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is
This is a slider phone and thankfully you can done most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys
The only things that I can thought of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dialed a new number thats not in your contacts and to text message
3MP camera camcorder music player 1GB microSD card bluetooth support and infrared port
Now the FM radio isnt satellite based so you can not picked up radio stations from across the U
Now I will went into the good and bad things about each feature
3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does 55
While you are recording the quality seems perfect
However once you play it it turns a bit distorted
Plus it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card
However I still could not found a way to changes the order of the songs without making a playlist
Theres play pause next song previous song fast forward and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures
The buttons must weren't pressed fairly hard so your music wont start playing spontaneously in your pocket
Also I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds
FM Radio I bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to bought an enhancement
Well the truth is you dont need to bought anything extra
Just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone and this will served as an antenna and will allowance you to hear stations
And since you need the earbuds to hears the radio yes the sound will go to the earbuds
However theres a loudspeaker option that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker but you still needn't to keeps the earbuds plugged in as it serves as the antenna
This means that if you want to hears the radio on your phone you NEED to have the earbuds with you
You may need to playing around with the position of the phone and antenna or you may have to move in order to getting clear reception
You cant deleting the precreated profiles those that come with the phone
In order to changed the phone to vibrate you must made a vibrating profile
Then to use it it takes several steps which is not hard but inconvenient
The interface shows the month and date but not the day of the week
Its much faster than the old one I used for an earlier Ericsson CF388
Good product the retractable chord feature is great and keeps the car clutter free
This one is great the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use
It looks pretty fragile but so far its held up to pretty heavy use
Many of the other chargers Ive owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection no such problems with this one
Easy to snapping on and it wont come off easy like others
This is the one you want if you dont like the bulky one
It slides around too much it needs a smaller fit it is too big
I have a baby pink Razr and this skin looks so good over it
Also it really adds grip so its not as easy to drop and the silicone stays warm in cold weather unlike the bare metal of the razr
I would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr they are awesome
This cover is great it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped
It isnt soft leather so if you want to protect your RAZR you might wanted to considers a shield
I think it will does a good job of protecting my phone in case I drop it
Hard shell protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable
protection on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover Ive seen for this phone
keeps keys and screen open so no dust gets pushed up against them
5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image then what the h
this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky
thinking about buying a couple more in different color
I am very happy with the phone case there are alot of cases available this is by far the best in my opinion
Wow I have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever
Clear soundgreat rangeand most of all its gorgeous
Only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjusting it constantly to fit correctly
It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it
It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days
I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size
Crystal clear sound along with being very comfortable and user friendly make this headset a great cell phone accessory to hasn't Love it Amazons price couldnt am not beat
fully compatible with Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR
not the best sound quality I like Logitech better
The sound quality in both units are great but Im impressed by the weight of this LG unit
It is like comparing stones to feathered a bit exagerated but you get the point
This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud which sits snuggly in my ear
which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls
That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my head a bit to keeps the unit against my ear
With the new LG I no longer have to look like I have a stiff neck while Im driving
This item came with the other item I ordered at the same time
Its quality is good but does not stay on the phone when opened as well as I would haven't liked
The title says it all Fits Great Great Price Real leather and fits like a glove
This product is a good deal if you know how to use it
Unfortunately if you are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may wants to reconsider
The Verizon Vcast product would be better because it comes with Headphones
If you already have the headphones which cost anywhere from 20100 than this product will be good for you
It fits great but doesnt cover the corners of the phone
The seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabbed your ear if not careful
The bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not planned to use the belt clip youre stuck with it sticking out in your pocket
I am using this as a spare so havent actually put it in the phone yet
i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync an idiot design if you ask me and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires
and to buying a cradle which used to coming with the palms was an extra 3040 so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat and you just need this plugged into your computer to doing both jobs of charging and hotsyncing
the reason why it got only 4 stars is bc when i first tried it my computer said that it didnt recognize the usb device
i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why
it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more
so the connector part could are a little sturdier thats all
Use it every day its a nice connector that does just what it says it does
As with all TreoPalm connectors you need to made sure the contacts are clean to gotten a good connection
Wiggling the connector where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to works for me
Its not listed in the product description but you can found the info on ziplinqs web site
The product works very well but might proves a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone
Overall I would recommended it if the user pays attention when connecting
Eventually prices will is free like the motorola Razor V3
Reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to added a memory card
Video and voice recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera
I was expecting just to save the touchscreen from scratches but these screens make the touchscreen also feel better
Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough
Have been using just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replaces it at least for another three months if at all Ill need to replace it
The only problem might be that it is hard to pulling it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone
It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did
For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt
One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should is so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well
and also because it holds it where the strap is it adds a little wear to that area
I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall which was highly over priced for my standards
Amazon seems like a great place to buy it but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories then you can find a site with free shipping for it and its 7 bucks
Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks but with shipping
So if you want a functional holster got this one
I have had this phone and Virgin Mobile pay as you go service for only a day or two but I wanted to write this review before I forget
Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in its a good ride
Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screen but its a pleasant experience
The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation
It seems a real nobrainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service
You can having fun with it or just ignored the fun stuffbut youll have to getting used to the funny graphics
You interact with the menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if youve been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences
One thing this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine thirties
While its a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing pay as you gofor me 18cmin theres a ton of stuff to playing with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel
I have Lily Tomlins operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds and if I should ever receives a text message among my canned response options that come standard with the phone are Hell no Cant talk and Leave me alone
My friend has had one for a few months and loves his
He makes a good bit more money than I and sports some fancy handheld devices so its not just that its so cheap and cool
Im a longrunning Virgin customer but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry and so Ive had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier including nonUS
Previous Virgin phones Ive used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255
My 8610 still works but its a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgraded
This is probably the cheapest phone of its sizecapabilities available anywhere
It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet I sometimes forgot its there
For the cost it is pretty decent in terms of features
128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support 10 MB for downloads 32 total speakerphone web capability comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices
For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight
Ive found this to been very reliable in my area and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors
Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell which was also good my old Kyocera on the other hand was garbage
The phones graphics are a bit odd but not necessarily in a bad ways
Good library of games ringtones and graphics available
Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on
Its no good if you want video on demand 3G or whatnot
But for just making callstexting now and then you simply cant beat 203 months
No annual contract as well which is a huge plus as many whove had one know all too well
They are a bit stiff as well which is good and bad good because you wont accidentally press them as easily bad because typing is more of a pain
Their web service costs extra and it has problems viewing many page formats says network gremlins when you try
You can browse basic html and thats about it good luck reading email with it
No bluetooth builtin though this is to aren't expected
This can actually be a good thing since camera phones are offlimits in more areas than you might expected
There are flaws with it as with any phone but the pluses outweigh the minuses
Ive seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone but in my professional opinion and it is an expert opinion these people need to realizing that you get what you pay for
This isnt a 200 Samsung T519 and youre not paying 60 a month for service on a 2 year contract
Considering the costs the Slice is an great handset with excellent service and that is that
Ive been a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agreed with an earlier reviewerif you want a phonephone without all the extra hoopla this isnt a bad deal
I bought a red Slice a couple of weeks ago take note that Im not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear and for my needs emergencies quick calls to family from the grocery store its just right
I got mine for free with Reward Zone points at Best Buy
Nice looking someone mistook it for a Chocolate the other day
Clear reception long distance calls are just as crystal as local not sure if this is an area thing but apparently the service in and around Chicagos solid
Payasyougo option works well for someone who doesnt spend a lot of time on the phone
My Slice holds a charge just fine Ive noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem but so far so good and doesnt heat up as someone else mentioned maybe that reviewers got a defective phone or battery
Its so slim my husband has bet me Ill lose the phone within a couple of months could weren't easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk
Someone else mentioned the odd graphics hot dog dripping blue sauce some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth
Seriously I have no idea what those things might be but I say its workable if you have a sense of humor
I have small hands slender fingers and I still manage to bumping the 3 whenever Im trying to shuttering off the phone
Sometimes its difficult to turn on the button doesnt always responded when I push it though could am not Im a wimp but once its on its fine
Im thinking this will get broken in with more use
I find myself staring at it just to appreciates its beauty phone confessions
And since I havent forked out hundreds of dollarsor any dollars reallyI wont feeling too guilty whenif I do manage to loses it under a pile of paperwork
I got my Slicer past black Friday for 19 from Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency
The Virgin plan 18 cmin pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they were originally made to done
First 20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 months one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30cmin to Eastern Europe
I used the phone on my business trip to calling home
The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phone so far
They also have planty of ring tones and graphic options
for downloading mostly priced about 2 per download
The phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuff except a camera
However the memory is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for 19
I am surprised to heard that other people complained about the battery life
The only bad thing I discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone for example during the flight I had to reconnect phone to charging in order to activated it again
I would sincerely recommends the phone and the Virgin pay as you go plan to mature users
1 When a headset is attached the phone does not ring through the external speaker
So if you are not wearing the headset when a call comes in
2 There is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time
In Standby the phone runs out of power after about six hours
To replied to a text you have to start a new message and then search for the sender of the original message
5 The ring tones that come with the phone are horrible
Aside from those few problems I have been quite satisfied with the phone
I got this phone to use as a phone and am very happy with it
I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review
I have a nice canon camera and dont want to use my phone to take pictures
I dont want to use my phone to listen to music or surf the internet either I just want it to makes and receive calls and maybe a text here and there
If you are one of those people that has a different agenda for your phone then this is probably not the phone for you
This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width but shorter
It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky
It makes a razr feel thick but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvr
The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phone
Sprints network is not the best in my area but my slice has been able to connecting wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar
When I was in the car the road noise got too loud to hear but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine and keep my hands on the wheel
Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lot
I expect to spent between 150 and 200 this first year including the 50 up front for the phone
The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would costs me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included
Although I havent tried them it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level
Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it it also looks like a real piece of equipment
As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plopping this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP
in vibrate mode of course At the same time my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phone so he can hadn't this one because it is so cool
The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu
What were they smoking when they decided to use a pig for my account a dragon for messaging etc
Other than that the features are all where you would expect them to aren't and navigating the menus is quite intuitive
Cant really commentates on reliability on this phone after just two weeks but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine
Perhaps because they are affordable in other ways Virgin screws you on ringtones and background
The four ringtones included are unacceptable and you are blocked from up or down loading your own
They do haven't a pretty big collection on their website you can getting for 2
The included wallpapers were chosen to were the most despicable choices possible too so you are likely to bifurcated out 2
00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well
Most of the time I do fine but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small
Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I havent run into that problem any more
Battery life has not lived up to what I read but that might be because of how I use it
I ordered an extra charger to keeps in the office and one for the car as well just in case
After two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls
It is not big on extras like a camera but what it does it does well
Virgin uses Sprints network see if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a Virgin phone
I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now
Ive used it for 3 years and really like its basic functionality
The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and thats pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have lowbattery life
Im hoping itll last for 2 more years before I get a new phone to catching up with the modern world
Saves time and updownloading pics tunes tofrom my phone
The Speck rubber case is the best case ive found for my Blackberry 7290
That being said its not ideal and id make a few changes
Pros protects case well no screen scratches minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag no need to use the belt clip most women prefer pursestotebags to belt clips and i love the fact that you can easily sees whether you have new messages no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag
Cons clear case collects dirt screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight screen cover doesnt fit squarely into the rubber case and screen cover gets scratches on it making the screen harder to read
I get a lot of compliments on this case its different enough to be noticed and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case
However because of the cons I suspect ill need to replacing this case more than once a year
But i like it enough that ill pay the 35 to do so
Maybe the next version will haven't some improvements
In the meantime i feel like im getting my moneys worth out of it
Im not really a gadget guy and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up
When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can stay in touch I needed to at least takes care of the thing
Im a minimalist and for that the Blackberry Skin is perfect A cool look not bulks
THIS COVER IS SO HOT I GET TONS OF COMPLEMENTS ON IT ITS A GREAT COLOR AND THE SCREEN PROTECTOR HELPS A LOT TOO
It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover most cases dont have this if you drop the phone and crack the screen youre hosed
The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip
I have had this for 2 months now and it has worked out well
I use it on my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercise I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone
When a call comes the AudiblePlayer pauses and I can answering the phone with the builtin button
Voice quality is fine on my end in both ears and I have received no complaints from the other end unlike the other reviewer maybe he got a bad unit or his stereo connector is dirty
I never have to stop my exercise or even slow down My only complaint is that the volume control doesnt work worth beans
When you rotate it at various positions you will hear from one ear or the other
There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears but that is not at the maximum volume
This is a bit annoying but something I can live with
I just leave it at one position close to the max volume but a little less and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume
It is so flexible and high quality soundvolume control
Just plug in a headset of your choice and you can
It will automatically shut off the music when the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headset still ON
Works with any headset and you can hears it in BOTH ears by the way
I keep my headphones on while on treo cell phone calls because it has a BUILT in Mic which is perfect
I have a stressful job and listening to music while I am working in my home office with headset and the ability to picks up calls and leaved my headset on with microphone is REALLY GREAT
In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants I let it dries out for 1 day and guess what IT WORKS
I am still using it as it works perfectly even the camera
I used my sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it
The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable
I will was keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives
This Samsung is the most reliable phone Ive ever had
Ive had it for two years dropped it NUMEROUS times and it is still going strong with only a few scratches
The battery life has declined during this period of time but it still lasts about two days before charging
While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now I am impressed with how many applications I use daily alarm clock scheduler memo pad etc
In all honesty though the camera is not terribly great
Pictures tend to have a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry
I still enjoy the camera if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options black and white brightness flash etc
The video option is rather lame though as the footage is choppy and you cant even transfer or send it to anything
Recently when I was on a shuttle two girls both with Razors saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to hasn't it as well
Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones
I am supposed to being getting a new phone too but I know I will wasn't keeping this one as a back up
If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone this is a good one
Almost 2 years ago my fiance and I signed up for a 2year contract with Verizon
And two years later both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents
This is a great phone for someone who would still liked the option to taking pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily
I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone
Sturdy Its not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultrathin phones
I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition
Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone the battery doesnt detach easily
Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson the battery would also detach and Id have to restart my phone
Compact Though it is on the thicker side this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it
Good Buttons For those who text message a lot the way the buttons feel can really made a difference
The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting
Menu short cuts On the side of the phone you can adjusting your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow
If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera video menu pop up
You can also choose which shortcut youd like when you press up I have mine set on the calendar
Long battery life Im not one to spends hours on my cell phone but for every day use this phone is great with respect to its battery life
There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and gone 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged
Camera has flash other neat options You can also adjust the brightness level have a self timer takes multiple shots 10 different fun frames and 5 different colortones like sepia monochrome black white and negative
Phonebook Contacts are easy to access and its easy to searches for entries
I like the fact that you can enters multiple numbers under one name
You can entranced that persons home mobile fax office and pager number
You can assigned a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorizing your contacts in different groups
Voice commandsBy pressing holding the button a voice command menu appears
Its a nice feature but is not something I often use
Speed dailing One feature that I do took advantage of is speed dailing
Its nice only having to pressured a button to instantly connected with another person
Menu styles There are 2 different menu styles you can use
I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through
My fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design
Despite the generous 15 ring tones its hard finding a ringtone that doesnt make you want to pulls your hair out
Out of the 15 ring tones there are only about 2 decent ring tones
Antenna I dont use the antenna very often but when I do it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy
If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommends investing in a better picture phone
Overall This cell phone is exactly that a cell phone to makes calls
It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone
It was my first phone ever and when it came time to got a new one i just couldnt find a phone as great as this one
So if your looking for a phone that will is able to handle almost anything cause let me told you mine went through world war 3 and its still working like new and not to mentions the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in time if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect i was and still am real pleased with this phone and it is an excellent phone for anyone
If youre hard on your electronics like I am this phone is for you
I put mine through the washing cycle as in washing machine yes three times letter it drying overnight and it still works perfectly
Ive also run it through the dryer twice dropped it countless times thrown it at a wall and ran over it on a mountain bike
The camera still works and I think the reception actually got BETTER after going through the washer
All it has is some scratches on the casing and a bent antenna
This is a perfect phone for a onthego klutzy person
The camera is pretty good and its small and cute in size and it has good reception
This Similar Unit is 14th the Cost of the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300 and it is JUST AS GOOD
Bottom line it is just a Piece of Plastic that gets the Job don
Ive had my snapon case for about a month and I love it
The magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone
The bottom case could fits a little more snugly but its not a problem
Fits great My Wife likes the bright color as it is easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone
The color and fit were great I was worried since it was a phone from Altell but it fit like a glove Thanks
You dont have to getting a car charger but its a good idea if you have a car
It fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it
I found that i had to files the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit
But sometimes it can slipped and press the buttons on the side of your phone
It can either made the phone not work or runs down the battery
First of all fast shipping and second of all what a great product it is I absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees it Thanks
I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover
I have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it
Only one complaint the clip is not tight enough on my belt would recommending a little tighter
This case is well equiped the handle wearing it on belt at worl plays movies etc
easily access good looking It functions at any level
The case fits like a glove Appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching
The cover and back were easy to attach and did not scratched my phone which I checked by removing the case
My only complaint was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt
No problem if you slide off the back cover and take off the small foam piece on the inside you will seeing a tiny screw
There will were a hole in your cover if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece
Attach the back cover to the phone and then fills in the hole with a piece of felt
If you are a clip user the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it
But maybe that is a good thing so that it wont falls off accidentally
I can not commentated on how well the case will wear since I have only had a few days
I chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone
This was a great price for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery
The only thing I dont like is the lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keeping the phone from sliding around
Id give it 5 stars if not for the cheezy cover it falls off sometimes
I like the shape of the plug so that it doesnt covers up any other outlets
If anyone needs one for twentyfive plus shipping that has not been registered with Net10 still has bonus 300 minutes and no number is new and has all original accessories open package or for ten extra you can get an OEM car charger leather case and earphone all unused please email movieshopathotmaildotcom
Ive had TracFone service for 2 days now and glad I switched
The C139 is small compact and fits in my shirt pocket
It lacks in ring tones and the address book could was better but for a simple phone its all I need
I dont need the internet access and all the other features I end paying for and not using
TracFone was quick to transferring my phone number which happened in 1 day and they said it would take 7 days
I wont go back to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in on a service agreement for 2 years
I have good service and will be saving 300 a year now
If you want a nice small light and simple phone that all you want to do is makes and receives phone calls this is the one
For the 50 bucks you pay here you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime
Thats not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere it would be 20 bucks and buying the airtime separately would also totals approximately 20 some odd bucks or so
Frankly I see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere
Regarding the sim card I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion
A sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD electro static discharge just like computer RAM is
ESD is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed
Id bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows
Before you handle the sim card you should ground yourself by touching something metal
Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD
I just transferred my mobile from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139 about the only edge the c139 has over the V120c is the color display
Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper
IMO Motorola could have added a port to accomodate a USB interface to this model
It was shortsighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c also in the same price range has such a port
Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time
I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday 102806 and it took over 5 hours for my number to is transferred over to the new phone
In Southern California the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular
Suffice it to says I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesnt recognize my number and to input my voicemail number
I anticipate nothing but problems with technical support when I contact them
They are very polite as customer service reps however they can barely speak or understood English
I am envisioning hours of BS with the call I have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever
Note to Tracfone Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT
Also I wasnt overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging
But the c139 does having one advantage in this regard text messages cost only 0
3 units versus on the V120c TracFone was deducting 0
5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message
Im not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone
It should being one uniform deduction across the board
Consumers should contact TracFone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon
Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone and wants an inexpensive phone with a much easier on the eyes color display
Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for 20 bucks
But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper and a little more flexibility then get yourself a Nokia 2126
For the same money you spend here the Nokia is a better phone
It has a USB port a speakerphone plus other extras
And you probably wont have any trouble setting up the voicemail either
i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer a friend program will gives each of us 100 free minutes
pleased sent me an email and i will sends you a fast referral
Customer service is fine and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use
If you decide to get a tracfone please email me for a quick referral before activating it we each will get 100 free minutes from the refer a friend program
Ill also send you the simple instructions to following
Ive used Tracfone for quite a while so i should being able to answer any questions you might haven't
ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should aren't able to gotten us the free minutes
i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer a friend program will give each of us 100 free minutes
please sends me an email and i will sends you a fast referral
I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great
I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good
I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces
This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good
i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine
Are we all talking about the same phone here I havent had any problems with it and using it is a breaze
I bought this phone after I wanted to changes my calling plan so I wouldnt get stuck with roaming charges while I was away far from my calling area
My old phone also an LG wasnt compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old ATT service
I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for
It does not hasn't a camera and I was not looking for one
I already own three very good stand alone cameras why bother with another I was although a little aggravated having to reenter all of my old phone book information because thats the only way you can don't it
The manual is not hard to reading at all unless you are dyslexic
After two nobrand aftermarket cables which were invisible to the phone and Nokia Phone Suite this cable and the included software driver worked perfectly
Note Nokia Phone Suite must be separately downloaded but is free of charge
We have uploaded photographs from our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone
Nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cable
I recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone
Some Motorola phones accept a universal miniUSB cable which I believe is cheaper
Although I have not used the headset yet the case and charger work perfectly
Be careful Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz
Read the Vital Statistics section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz
Check the Sony web page and other people who sell this phone and you will saw that it does not work on 850MHz
I dont own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy
I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case I have no idea if this phone is really good or not
Purchased this phone a little over a month ago and so far everything works well and have no problems
Many nice features and the service in the state of GA is good
I bought this phone as part of the SprintNextel SERO plan
I used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didnt fit my needs for several reasons outlined below
Battery life was sporadic I got maybe a day worth of power from it
For the price of the phone and the two year contract it carries this is a dealbreaker
The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years so I have some experience with coverage around town
I was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals
An incoming call would lighting up the display but there would is no ringing
This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring
For the same monthly service fee I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet ability
Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen but if Im going to aren't locked into a 2 year contract I would likes to have some fast internet access on the phone
If I were then my opinion of this phone might isn't a little higher since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network
I could not justify being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed subpar on a network that did not and likely never will support the latest high speed technologies
Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phone
Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so the microSD card is accessible from the outside no need to pull the battery to update the card
You CAN NOT use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the microsd card as ringtones
You also can not readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download
Any message mms that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpapering
Battery life on my phone is flaky Im getting maybe a day and onehalf with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages
There are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their microSD memory card however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with
Note Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company
Nextel there are only a couple reasons that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint
Second if you have a need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature
The Sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications
The Nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrialconstruction market
For almost every consumer the Sprint side is a better deal
Sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives
Heres my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks
Nextel smsmms messages can now aren't autodownloaded I believe this is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature
cant play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other nonNextel transfer Note Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable but this may being more technical than the average user would likes to tackling
Nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things
While not entirely unexpected it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to nonconstruction users Nextels core group
If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most Sprint plans which include them
Nextel doesnt have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers
Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens
the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to
while not phone related some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals
I am only getting about a day of battery life which is extremely low
I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first
how brilliant They shouldve provided some sort of User Guide on how to puts the case on
The seller is awesome very Amazonlike shipping i
The leather is nice and what you cant saw from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard
When closing the keyboard the plastic does catch a little but I think that will go away the more I use it
The phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior
Each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather
The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating ok and ptt
The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen
On the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc
Another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clip however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case
I was very happy to saw that Amazon shipped me PalmOne brand Styluss and not some generic
This is a great deal and Im going to order some more
The hell with Palm that changes stylus with every new model
Great battery now the phone goes way longer without needing to weren't recharged
I ordered this headset in silver Webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really IS silver We argued about the color and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white silver red and black
It took almost a month to gotten resolved but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered
There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit
The headset gets 4 stars Webtreo only gets 1 star
This is by far the best bluetooth headset in the market it is small and very light as well just like wearing an earing
The sound is amazingly clear people on the other end thought I was actually using my phone
I have no problem with it falling off just making sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ear
Im so happy with this cutie that Im buying it for my sisters friends
Consumer Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as the best
I can hears my callers while driving and they can hearing me
The Samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headset so you wont look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car
And if you want to be one of those people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places its small enough where people will really wonders if youre a crazy person talking to yourself
Gim me a break The Samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger
This is super handy since the headset is so small and would were easy to lose or damaging if not for the sturdy but not at all bulky carrying case
The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headset that I did not quickly return due to poor headset volume
I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my car
I simply could not hears the people to whom I was talking
The Samsung is the first to provisioning enough volume
Im still happy with it after two months of ownership
The Samsung was also approximately 35 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy or other retailers whether online or in person
The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stay in your ear while running
I learned this one morning when I was late for work and ran from my car to my office
If the Samsungs short talk time is not a concern for you then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremely small package
The button on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call
Works much better and more reliably than ANY BlueTooth set Ive tried and Ive tried almost all of them
only problem is that it is easy to dropped and the scrren smudges easil
This case has good quality construction and fits properly
It solves the problem of being able to plug in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case
I prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses
I also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working
The fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning
This is still the best optional case if you want to use the MP3 player feature and require the use of earphones
I recently took a chance on this item and I am happy to reporting that its not bad
I was actually not looking forward to a swivel bad experience but the swivel is very solid
The only problem I have with it is that you have to took out the phone completely in order to use it
My only complaint is that the cord is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the price
The short cord is the only reason it didnt get a 5 star rating
you can tells that the quality is not as good as the one you would gotten in a retail store
but it does the job well and i have never had a problem with it
I have nothing but good things to say about this purchase and product
I only wish they could makes a PDA phone that wasnt as big as a boat
However the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily
The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flipped opened the phone when phone is in the holster
How stupid is that Why would Samsung supplied this type of holster to their customers
You can now flip opening your phone when using this holster
I wasnt expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case but Im very impressed
I bought from accessory one the total cost was about 4
The case fits nearly perfectly every hole is the right size and in the right place not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case
Others have complained of chipping paint but in the week Ive been using this it hasnt chipped yet
If I remove the belt clip there is still an impediment where it use to be
For the quality and fit of this cover the price is a bargain
It fits very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grip
I found the razr v3 to be akward or slippery at times and this cover takes care of that problem
If youre looking for a slim cover that wont add a lot of bulk to your RAZR this one is great
No it probably WONT provide much protection if you drop your phone
It DOES protecting your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints and the rubberized material is easy to gripping and feeling great in your hand
The cutouts for the outside display camera I have a V3m and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well
I dont use the belt clip as the cover by itself adds hardly any bulk so I just keeps my phone in my pocket
Without the belt clip there is a small snap that sticks out a bit from the back of the cover but its really no big deal
Thought Id post this info here since this subject still confuses people
I just talked to a cust care representative who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180day period will invalidate 250 Amazon phone rebate
Well I guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer since I dont really need a data plan and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time
I still would like to given it 5 stars since I believe it is a great product
Ill take one star off however due for its weak battery life and lack of standard audio connection 2
There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate
My intent is to document some of the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heeding and correct in the future
I am a business user who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device
I use a Motorola H700 headset with my old devices and the 8525
My overall assessment is Replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I dont think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use
All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flip phone
If readers find that there is a way to performed any of the deficiencies I describe please letter me knowing
Blue tooth audio should always comes through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting
To hears my voice commands repeated I have to turn on the annoying sound of the PDA so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset I can hear my voice commands repeated back
I am referring to the standard voice dial that comes with the 8525
One quick solution would am not to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA
Even nicer would was an upgrade that allows full audio with the VoiceCommand software this is documented in many other reviews
Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate
It changed back to the original audio setting after turning off the BT headset
1a If I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS displaying the voice dial page
Instead the initial Owner Info page stays up and you cant sees the name on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screen
If you didnt set the PDA to its annoying noise level you cant hear the name you requested either
2 Need to be able to control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio Vibrate or OFF
For example need to be able to tied turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF or vibrate
3 Need to aren't able to program how long the display stays on
I am constantly groping to found the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off when I need to sees something
4 I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if one was available for long drives when my BT headset battery is dead
Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeway
5 Provide a built in way to making the PTT and Comm Manager and IE Quick key buttons programmable
I would use them for many other functions such as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker need to were able to selected speaker here see below
6 Give me a way to press an external button to toggling between speaker on and off
I cant easily pushes the speaker icon with my fingers
Add a radio button on the volume control that allows you to select speaker phone
Yes you can selected the phone speaker soft button but often the display has gone blank and the keypad is showing
7 Provide option to saved email attachments to stored card
That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed me to captures lots of attachments without running out of memory
8 Remember the Filter setting I selected for Tasks
If I have filtered by a task category during that session remembers the filter I selected
Currently I have so many tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up
9 Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key or make this button programmable I am always having to close the browser because it gets hitselected
10 Let me EditPaste with one step for notes word task notes etc
With 8525 OS you must select Menu then Edit then Copy
Question is there a key on the keypad to select CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC the letters are underlined in the menu but I dont seeing a CNTRL key on the keypad
11 Allow the trackwheel to scrolls up to the icons on the top and then use the nav button to motions across the icons might be the way to allowance an external way to set audio volume
12 If I power off the device have it remember my input selection
I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do
However eventually i found out that the phone part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone
My friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking
The phone earvolume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places
Software The windows applications Word Excel Media player
Plus Ability to created office documents and play games
Hardware Micro sd slot Sandisk card cost me 20 bucks
Wireless Internet You could connect this device to any wireless unsecure network to gets to the internet
I dont have a data plan with Cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my WIFI home network
If iam at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free
The view finder is sloppy and can not capture images in low light
Battery needs to been charged every second day depends on usage but even with light use i had to charges it every other day
To listen to music need to purchase microsd card
Leather case by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device
The only problem is that after you put this case on the phone volume needs to be set to the max even after that you wont am not able to hearing the other person so well
But the boxwaver case could were opened half way and folded over
If you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you
Build quality is typical of HTC meaning very good
The call quality is good provided youre in a decent service area system not overloaded with AMRHR kicking in
The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable
The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback
There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult this is perhaps the ultimate geek phone
The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools
There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile but IMHO its not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to am not
In general things work as they are supposed to with this phone
One drawback is that while the device does supports the Bluetooth A2DP profile stereo bluetooth sound the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible
The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono which means youll have to manually edited the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth
The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improving
And even after all of that there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio
In other words dont wasting your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously
However the bluetooth does worked very reliably with most regular monoone ear BT headsets I recommend the Jawbone and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable
Another audio related drawback of this device There is not even a 2
The only physical audio out is through HTCs proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack
The saving grace here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable and also the availability of HTCto3
Even with a few shortcomings I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market
It packs an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor
If youre in need of a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices this is your phone
Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed
I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professionalbyday GadgetFreakbynight guy
If you dont reading anything else in my review please understand this
1 This is a Microsoft OS and things will goes bump
2 If you are NOT in the market for spending around 110 a month for a service plan voice and data you have no business with this phone
This is a productiviy enhancer it is not 100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day this phone does the trick
The battery life isnt that bad as I have this thing in its cradle not included during the day
Active Sync is so easy to setup a noob could done it
The only reason reason I didnt give it 5 stars is the fact that it cant make me a cocktail
This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia its quite popular in Singapore and the HTC TyTN in Europe but in an unlocked model
and quite a bit more expensive than what Cingular sells it for here
If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product you will think its a heavy over feature laden product that you will never fully use and its a problematic one at that
Having said that this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today
are such that you would never needs to brings a laptop with you
There were initial problems with this phone in the Asian market that have now been since resolved and is now robust and reliable
But one caveat to keep in mind when using this product
Meaning if you are not familiar with Windows devices it may frustrate you
But if you can overlook that it will performs better than anything available
Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brandnew 3GWificamera equipped smartphone
It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service
Email and internet works very well in both locations
Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette and use a card reader and USB cable for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips
The color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone
Again 1GB allow you to take a very long video in Windows Media Player format
Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronizes to Lotus Note emails contacts and calendaring any time any place and automatically chime schedule notices
The only drawback are the battery life which require frequent charges slow keypad for phone calls and I do not know how to silence the keypad and a little tough keyboard touch
Lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult especially shiftA
In addition Microsoft Word processing is slow and so as Excel which will requiring a faster chip
Overall a great allaround pocket PC in this generation
I bought my 8525 when they first came out like two months ago right after christmas
I upgraded to a 2gig memory card and also have the GPS service
I love my phone though it might hasn't problems time to time and some getting used to
Overall this was the best purchase for the price I ended up spending almost 900
but I also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and some other features
I would like to sees the iPhones operating system though
Yes you do hasn't to restart the device it does get hung but i dont blame the phone after all it has windows mobile 5 in it
The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week So be careful
Other than the fact that it has windows The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to haven't
If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature
Once you buy the phone i suggest that you get this software Spb Pocket plus
It helps shutting down softwares running in the background and adds more features
The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features
Sorry Microsoft but you need to removing the bugs outta this windows too
I bought this cable knowing by reading the reviews that it might not worked so for the price I gave it a shot
This USB cable was a replacement for my other cable that was used as a chew toy by my dog
Since I already had DataPilot susteen software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computer with the phone attached it saw it as a susteen USB cable and installed all the drivers on winXP if you dont have susteen driverssoftware you can obtaining the drivers for the USB cable for your phone from their website free download
I never used the installation CD that came with this USB cable and I installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes it also works with the DataPilot software but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830
i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id
if you havent activated your tracfone yet then the refer a friend program will gave each of us 100 free minutes
please sent me an email and i will sent you a fast referral
Once i got the phone activated I havent had any problems
Tracfone has a refer a friend program that will giving each of 100 free minutes
All you have to doesn't is sends me an email asking for a referral
Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things
Just unscrew the tip of the stylus and youve got a pen
You never know when youll need one so when you do there it is
It also blends in well with the design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactilely
The product came promptly and I am happy with the quality
However fitment wasnt perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo
Not a huge problem but something I would feel everytime I reach for the stylus
But the pen works pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands
I would definately recomment this product to others
This is the original and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy
Fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the V188
Fried my original one when used it abroad with wrong voltage
Shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item
I definetly will continued to do business with Amazon and A1 Accessories
Kind of difficult to placing without getting some kind of stuff between the screen and the protector
I recently bought a Nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and creating my own ringtones
However the Nokia CA53 cable was around 50 dollars
So far everything that I have used it for is working flawlessly
I would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the CA53
This product helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone
Eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them
Comes with an unlabeled cd couldnt tell one side from the other that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones arent labeled in any helpful way
It also has links to any 1st party software you need though Im sure a Google search would isn't just as easy
I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect
The belt clip is very strong making accidental unclipping rare
The pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts
The front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets
The bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the Chocolates End button
This allows you to silences calls without having to remove the phone from the case
The only dislike I have is the name Cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really a big deal
I would recommended this case to anyone who owns a Chocolate
Ive had this case for under a month but its working great
When I first got the case I thought I was going to have to sending it back because I thought it was too small for my phoneI have an LG CU500 from Cingular
The case has since seemed to stretch a little so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out
The computer recognizes my phone when I plug it in but the drivers on the provided CD are pretty much worthless
I needed a Razr Car Charger and the Crystal Clear Hard Shell Case was included with the purchase
I did not think I would even use it but I love it It is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my Razr phone
There are stick on belt clips that work fine with this
a nice bonus hard shell case that doesnt ruin Razrs stylish look a single bit
The charger wasnt very fancy but it seems to works fine and the price was very reasonable
I wasnt interested in the case but after I got it I found it to wasn't very useful and the best part of the deal
Eventually prices will aren't free like the motorola Razor V3
Reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card
Video and voice recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera
Im using it with TMobile so your mileage may vary
In my opinion its a featurepacked phone at a reasonable price for an unlocked smart phone at least
The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well although I did experienced some lags and software freezes with thirdparty apps
I think the menu organization could be smarter but you can customize much of it
I do love that the default screen displays your days calendar agenda
Photos with the 3megapixel camera are grainy it also has a VGA camera
Since this is a phone first and not a camera there is also no stabilization control
Your friends family and colleagues will hearing you clearly
On your end however it will sounding like youre talking on a cell phone
Its not bad but Ive had conversations on better sounding phones
I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet WLAN access
The problem is that if you arent at that location regularly you will has to search for a new network
One way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider
I agree however that some kind of onebutton autodetect would be ideal
The metal cover pops off fairly easily as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first
The phones slider form factor moves smoothly perhaps too much so
By default sliding the phone completely open something thats hard but not impossible to did accidentally unlocks the keypad
Its 5way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than youd probably expect
The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible
When enabled it works contextually on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs
Overall I give this phone high marks for features but a few annoyances mean its far from The Perfect Phone
I got this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back
Just right off the box the phone is quite impressive
Many complain about the response time yes this phone is slow but doesnt bother me far better than my windows machine Overall very good phone for what it offers
This phone tops in ergonomics ease of use presentation features Bluetooth speakerphone and call quality
Nokias connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market
It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots of money
I accidentally downloaded a big chunk of data and going to pay through my nose next month
All the apps that come with this phone are quite good
Also I transfer musicthemesringtones using data cable from my Wintel
The phone automatically toggles to Mass storage mode when it is connected to PC which is pretty neat
I havent faced any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily
I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 23 days good enough for my call volumes
Having the wifi feature helps you to setting all the bookmarks while youre at home and then use it wisely while you are away
Camera settings are similar to professional cameras very very impressive
Battery life as many claim seems short but I charge my gadgets daily so not a big issue
The headset that comes with the phone is really good
Tonnes of themes apps etc available for this phone
My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed
It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I selected an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left
My second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on the screen light does not coming up
So you wont know even in the day which button to pressurizing to answered the question Unlock phone you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain
The picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get
There is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final image
I sincerely hope if there would be some sw patch for this
I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i
That is one far superior camera quality I saw so far
I am putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket the phone could turns on and ends up with accidental redialing
So you would need a small app to do the locking properly
At this point Nokia has better phones like N95 etc of course very expensive
I think this is going to be a very good phone but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800
well I called NokiaUSA direct and regular retail from them is 499
all day as many as you want so it should isn't considerably less on Amazon
I recieved good customer service and excellent help from these guys
Thanks for allowing me to kept this phone with my network
I didnt want to gives it up just yet and you allowed me to get another phone just like the one I had
My V180 is through Cingular I never have a dropped call and reception is excellent
Long Battery life very easy menuswayfinding and small size
No frills like MP3 player or camera however just a very good phone
Ive had this phone for a year and a half with no problems
It is good for making calls which is really all I ask for from a phone
It is easy enough to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and theyve had no problems
My carrier is Cingular and Ive had excellent service in the NY tristate area and because it is a quadband phone Ive also been able to use it while roaming internationally
Battery life is just okay not as good as my old Nokia
I have to recharge every other day with normal use
Overall its lasted me long enough that I would call it a good value
If youre the type of person that doesnt spend HOURS on the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you
I bought this phone in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great
I would saying that the only gripe about this phone in the US is the price I wouldnt pay over 40 bucks for it
The screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones
It didnt seem possible that the stuff would actually worked for such a low price
Even though shipping was steep it was still worth the money
The case fits great and it hasnt cracked at all
Both chargers work great I think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it but I cant complain I would highly recommended this package
just for the car charger alone verizon wanted 24
the plastic cover for the phone is very good as the razr phone scratches pretty easily
The chargers might feel a little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality
Helps reduce clutter and now I can actually closed my cup holder tray Acura RDX
It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended it doesnt get in the way like the spiral cords do
I never measured the cord when extended but it is much longer than most
You go to your service provider store and buy a car charger and it will costing you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better
The retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchased from cigular or sprint stores
Ive had it for about 2 months and I am still happy with it
It has a little blue led light that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but I like it
I like the way it doesnt take up space in the console when I am not using it and it seems to charge the L6 just fine No complaints with the devise or the service from Amazon
ive had this charger for the last couple of months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it
It is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone
Car charger serves it purpose it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter
You just needed to make sure you plug the connector in the right way
I would have liked some type of label that would hasn't identifed it as a motorola compatible device
The cord is a little short but have had no functionality issues
It was exactly what I needed and works as well as one that would hadn't cost me 20 or more in the stores
I purchased this battery becuase my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of serviceso it was time
It does last longer and Im glad I bought this battery
I have no bad reviews about this so if you have an audiovox 8910 cell phone and you need an replacementthis is the one
It is the standard Palm battery meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device
Note also that when using Bluetooth andor the Blackberry Rim email service battery life is notably reduced
The solution would am not lower device consumption or a bigger capacity battery neither of which appear possible at the moment
It installed very easily with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first day
It has far out performed and put to shamed the more expensive bulkier unit it replaced
This navigation system is truly a useful tool when traveling in areas you are not familiar with
I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell and opted to pays a little bit more for a product that appeared to weren't top notch
The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use
Cosemetically it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards This is an excellent product
I used to forget my wallet but I always had my blackberry so I bought this then since I take my phone every where but not my wallet This salved the problem
This is good for people who forget their wallet or phone but remembered to bring the other
I love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one
It is just nice to have to keeping up with one less thing
I highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff
These are well worth the money for your Nextel Phone Although it may not listed it from Experience these batteries fit 95 of all the Nextel phones
Take a look at your phone battery to see if its the same shape
The color will is different as these have a white cover
They are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store
Plus these were NEVER used before Unlike the celluar store battery these batteries come in a box with the battery in shrink wrap so you know the battery has not been used
When you buy then in the cellular store they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed and youd never know it plus there is no shrink wrap Ever buying a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months Hmmm I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one Would you know
These batteries are well worth it Buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days
This charger works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
It is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone
This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery
However it seems expensive for what you get not to mentioned the fact that what the text doesnt tell you is that you need an additional expensive serial cableadapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable
Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price
and just placed the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges
i couldnt believe how small it is compare to the pictures i saw online
however one bad thing about that is that i lost it already
i would recommand it to anyone whos thinking about buying one
When I lost my Stylus I had a difficult time finding a replacement
Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phone models A630 A850 A950 A970 A930 A990 A645 and A870
The thin adapter makes this charger very easy to pluged into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office
I originally bought another Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one
I returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not bets It actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer
Its a great product for a great price Delivery was quick too
It fits like a glove and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases
Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer
All buttons of the phone are accessible through the case
The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wearing the phone on your belt and easily removing and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of your waist
You can not access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case
The clear plastic screen that covers the phones screen is a little to far from the surface of the phones screen
This makes it more difficult to pressing buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen
The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but Im not sure
On the positive side you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can are found online
The screen is perfect for text but not for pictures
Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots
I expected to use it like a typical pilot where you write on the screen
Good reception great sound quality Speakerphone is great Neat features
The Treo600 has all the functions I needed phone calendar camera etc
1 the screen is not good for viewing pictures but thats what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo650
2 the phone failed to dial two times in two months
I had to turned off the phone and on again to fixes the problem
This is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen
It has a slightly frosted surface to cuts down on glare but the frosting is impossible to saw when the screen is on
Ive washed mine it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky
Just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place
It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bend it IT WILL NEVER GO BACK
Durable thick doesnt interfere in any way with the touch screen
I havent had to washes it yet so I havent tried out that feature
But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these its been totally worth it to me hey after spending hundreds on your Treo whats a few dollars
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
When the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good
This is the state of the art for screen protectors
And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will getting dulled and scratched
Because of the thickness and quality of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
I had it up and running in minutes with my LG VX8600 Verizon
I downloaded BitPM free software to use with the cable
I just followed the installation instructions that came on the CD that comes with the cable
I clicked on discover phone in BitPM to have it automatically found the phone
I didnt even need to going and look for the com port as the installation says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phone
When installing make sure you pick the right driver
if you have XP choose the XP driver not the NT or Win98 or other driver
My only complaint is in the description they dont state the length of the cable
My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly
I had to comprehending this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall
I projected the cable to were about 6 feet and if you do yourself youre in for a surprise
This cable is only about 3 feet long otherwise everything is fine
The description doesnt state this but the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models which really helped me
On a better note shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated
I have a VX9900 enV and this cable works great with it in conjunction with BitPIM
Not much to say about it really it does what it should
got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everything awesome deal for 3 bucks
Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install
No synchronization software is included so you have to use a thirdparty tool like bitpim
I ordered this cable on December 1st got it on the 8th
It came with drivers but I didnt needing it because I found drivers online
The cable fit perfectly with my LGVX9900 and to my surprise it charges too
I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525 and hasn't had a few problems wit
First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clipping it to my belt
Second the aluminum case isnt the sturdiest so now its sort of bent referring to the hinge I guess Ive been really rough on my phone but I just bend it back to where its supposed to be referring to the hinge
my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it
When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip instead I recieved a full refund so that was a pleasant suprise
I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone
The K790a is currently the best Cybershot camera phone in Sony Ericssons lineup but more are on the way and also handsdown the best camera phone in the U
Its too bad that SE doesnt sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside
But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera
Sure its only 3MP but like many professionals will tell you pixel count is only one thing
This 3MP camerainaphone takes betterlooking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar Aptech sp Samsung and other offbrand companies
My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card I was simply blown away by the quality
Of course I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality but the results still far exceeded my high expectations
I dont care for the MMS features because my prepaid service Speak Out Wireless doesnt support them
I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader
I wish there were optical zoom more and more camera phones in Japan including models from Casio now have optical zoom but the truth is of course that if you need serious picturetaking you still use a real digital camera
But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam
Ill use this for a year and upgrade to SEs next gen next year hopefully by then theyll have released optical zoomequipped K phones
Reception is pretty good on the TMobile Cingular networks used by Speak Out Wireless
Pictures are amazing for a phone MP3 player could use a little help
Screen is beautiful and as always menu interface is a treat
The phone is Java 2 compliant however many programs that run in the background will not notice aren't able to noticed you unless the program is open
Very other than the MP3 player and Java notification issues the phone is a 5
purchased the phone about 3 months like the nice QVGA screen and impressed with excellent cam it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors
the phone has good reception at least on par with W810
voice call is OK but as other users stated the level is kinda low esp speakerphone firmware upgrade R1KC001 will help
the operation is standard SE style if you are familiar youll weren't OK without reading manual
the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio still used by BBC and it works well with TMobile internet it can plays local mp3 VBR supported wma asf audio rename the extension to
wma realaudio but I wish it supports ogg vorbis which is the audio format I use
bluetooth works pretty well it works with ALL bt equipment I have including wireless headphones
logitech headphones users please reads in order to made the headphones works properly you need to went to bt menu and connect from there
web browser can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html and wap sites
the phone is kinda bulky and a bulge on cam cover but its pretty comfortable and firm to hold making messaging is a good pleasure
though the phone has lot of functionsfeatures are pretty appealing it lacks something its supposed to have
quadband this is not acceptable for this price even many lower models have quadband K550 W610 W580 W810 Z710 W710
music player should has more file format support ogg vorbis streamimg wmaasf shoutcast
m2 memory card though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB PSP card is a lot cheaper
QVGA screen and it shows clock when the phone is idle
low earpiece and speakerphone level though firmware upgrade will fixes
conclusion if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam go for it however if you travel a lot settle with quadband models theyre cheaper
Ive had 3 cell phones prior to this one all Motorola and I really thought they were all pretty good phones
However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water Its very compact and durable you can tell it was made with an incredible level of quality control
This is why I bought the phone now I am never without a camera
The flash is good and strong so it takes great pictures with good focus
I dont really use the mp3 feature because I have an iPod
However I was VERY disappointed that it wouldnt allow me to use mp3s as ringtones
I heard this was because my service provider is a jackass and not the phones fault though
With a little bit of forum browsing I was able to hacks my way around this if you have this problem email me at skibum2801yahoo
now I have my very own custom ringtones that come out as clear as day with the nice speaker
I feel as if Im simply using my home phone its so great
The buttons took a little bit to get used to because I was a Motorola girl for so long but I picked it up quickly and now I have no issues
Pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carrier
Super easy to upload pictures straight to Flickr via phone
This is a top selling handset in Europe but tricky to gets hold of in the US which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology
Coming from a SonyEricsson T637 I was familiar with the SE UI so getting used to this phone was relatively easy for me
I love the camera it takes amazing pictures and the music player serves my needs just fines
Support for a memory card is a huge plus I have a 1 GB Sandisk M2 Micro card and now I never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos
This phone also allows for extensive customization in terms of shortcuts and themes ringtones and so forth which is another plus
As far as negatives for the phone I only have a few minor ones the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet and the camera lens cover sometimes slides open in my pocket but neither of these would convincing me not to getting this amazing phone its quite possibly the single best phone Ive ever owned Definitely very happy with this purchase
Es el mejro celular q pude encontrar tar pasar 2 meses leyendo Reviews en mil paginas
mp un screen de colores hermosos radio videos movies mp3 bluettoth memory card buenos acesesorios incluidos Es el mejor celular del mercad
EDGE device makes internet data fairly quick and usable as PC modem via bluetooth
camera lens cover needs a lock switch mine opens just walking around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket very annoying
sleep timer is a bit quick and should were adjustable
I shouldnt expect it thinner since it is the size of a very small digital camera but Id still like it slimmer
The xenon flash really helps taking night pictures
I use to owning the w800i and this one takes way better pictures
It has autofocus and other several fucntion that i havent used yet
I love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phone
It also very easy to navigate through the phone functions
My computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded
The only complains i have about this phone is the headphones
Walkman series have way better headphones so when you get this make sure to buys new headphones and adapter
Another complain is the expensive memory stick micros
and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned
It has also replaced my camera and I am now never without a camera
I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited
They dont give the phone a second glance not realizing its got the 3
I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows
After throwing in a 1GB memory stick I think it was 79 it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300 pics right now
The movie function rocks too however you are going to wants to be up very close to the subject
The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though so at least concert videos make for good listening
If I throw it on the USB cable it pops up instantly as another drive just like the camera
If I dont care about viewing the files and just wanting to move stuff on and off the phone I dont even take it out of my pocket
The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around
Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program
The contact list is easy to work with the call clarity is no issue at all good signal no dropped calls etc
It needs charging about every 3rd day charges very quickly
Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges
The only thing I can thinks to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charging it only wants to charged it to 89
If I want 100 I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes
I paid 14 as much for this product and it works just as well as the name brand product
The product was delivered in a timely manner and functions properly
The photo of this Premiun Side case is not at the Photo
The side case in the photo have a Treo Logo and the producto dont have i
I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car
The clip just wouldnt grip my belt securely enough
I gave up after the 3rd time my Treo 650 hit the concrete
Most of the time I just slip the thing in my left pocket but that doesnt work so well with some pants especially jeans
I decided to tried the Treo leather case and I like it quite a bit
The clip is strong and I find it easy to gets the phone in and out of the case
This is the third case I tried for my Treo 650 and its simplicity is its key to success
My first case had a flapping piece of leather that cost 35 and was totally useless
My second skin had a belt clip that whenever I bent over to tie my shoes for example the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor Simply bad design
This well designed Premium Side Case is easy to use easy to wears and gives excellent protection
When the phone is in vibrate mode you are always aware when you get a call page or email
Its small enough that its not a problem when worn with a suit and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt
Good design is always fashionable and the case is well made
I used to carry my Treo 600 with the original case that came with the device
But soon I found out that the original case is kind of loose and my Treo fell out from it once
Luckily it was on a carpet so no damage at least no visual damage
After that incident I started looking for a better case and this one is what I found
What can I say you dont know how bulky Treo is until you wear one on your belt
The case does its job it provide a nice and secure protection for Treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway so you dont have to carrying it around with your hand or in you pocket which barely fit
But Treo is quite heavy and its thick so you will definitely aware your Treo is hanging on your belt
And sometime I just feel like its too much a burden and I want to get it off me
But overall I still prefer to have this than the original case
And the heaviness is not this cases fault should blame Handspring now PalmOne for not making it lighter
This case is great for protecting my Treo but the downside is that I have to removing it from the case to use it
I purchased it because I had actually dropped my Treo when walking with it balanced on my portfolio now I clip it to the portfolio and it is secure and safe and I dont run the risk of leaving it behind
Dont waste your time looking for another case this is the best
How come phone accessories dont qualify for prime shipping How are they different from other electronics
The only negative comment that I will made about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit
Amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price
The fit is snug and secure enough not to fall off and get lost
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to typifies
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does didn't what is was designed to done
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should having paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to removing these somehow
Driver install was easy and Bitpim access works just fine
The cable I received also charges the phone VX8300 from Verizon
I agree with previous reviewers Gely ZenCity regarding this cable
The price was right set up was easy and with the Bitpim program you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently
I loaded my whole Outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones
Dont waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from Verizons sites VCast and such just hooking this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the musictones that you already owning
You will likely needn't some type of additional software to actually DO anything with the phone
I ordered this cable two of them actually to use on the LG 8300
The driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300
I used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phone
I was unable to locates a data cable locally and was happy to finding one on Amazon even though it was only available through a third party
All in all I recommend the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300
For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to be no driver included for your phone
However I already had a driver that I knew worked so I did not use the disc
Product is excellent and does all it is supposed to done
I was very pleased when I got this cell phone case
I was really frustrated with my phone before purchasing this case
I kept on getting the screens dirty every time I made a call
It feels good it has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth
It protects my phone I have two boys and while they are supposed to not touched dads phone it has an almost 100 chance of getting dropped sooner or later
Like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the camera a little but not a big deal camera is not so hot anyhow
I have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best
The rubber suit covers every bit of the phone so I am confident that I wont aren't getting any scratched
You can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched
There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isnt going to fallen out
3 minor qualms The see through plastic has a little glare on it especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suit
Also it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock
noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt
Last the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the camera
You already know the v710s camera is crap for its specs but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap
I just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice
It feels solid and professionally made not some cheap import special
I like the blue LED light instead of the typical red dot
Also the cord is long enough to talks and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging
The IC chip is important so that you dont overcharging your phone battery and shortening its life
The only problem is that it can only hold the standard battery so your out of luck if youre using the extended battery for your A920 phone
Other than that its a very nice and stylish case for the Samsung A920 phone
top part of telephone gets loose very often elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily
I have a 6255i phone and used the cable to connect to a windows XP home system
Installation was seemless and the drivers from XP worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately
Downloaded the Nokie suite software from the Nokia site to works with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine
Cellphone companies wanted 50 bucks for the same cable
Use this one you will save money and its the same cable
The cable came faster than expected I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow
The cable came with the software driver although I did not needed it and worked great with my already installed Nokia Sync software
Electro Island had the best price by far and the service was excellent
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to weren't
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increased the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to typified
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keeps it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
Bluetooth can not was accessed when the phone is in the pouch
I was so easy and fast to order and the person I bought it from seemed to making it easier
I have had no problems with charger and am very happy with my purchase
I dont need to buy stuff online when now I can download it straight to my PC
makes it easy to transfer Pictures videos ring tones contact numbers
My original charger broke that caome wit the cell phone
I was going to go buy a charger but they cost like 30 if you get the name brand
This one I purchased does the trick and saved me lots of money
I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand charger I got with the phone
While it does charges I am unable to gets the battery charged to more than 98
I am unsure however if this is because my battery is less effective than when new
This holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with the phone
It has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt
It is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holster
The thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy inout
This item cost 1 penny of course the shipping was 4
84 but I thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores
Ive had it for two weeks and it hasnt broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally
Order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters
This belt clip was exactly what I was looking for and the price was great
If I could change one thing the swivel action is just a little looser than I would like but definatly not a problem
Ive had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now and I just loving it I am very new to all this fancy cell phone stuff the last one I had was bare bones basic
It is great having a phone that you can did so much with
The camera is so handy since I never remember to take my other camera anywhere with me and the mp3 player and radio are also great to have
The music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadnt made up my mind until I saw this phone and what an awesome deal it was
You just cant beat a one cent phone with free shipping and 75
00 in rebates TMobile had my old Net10 phone number ported to the new phone in 2 days The customer service people have been so nice and the ability to buy ringtones wall paper and myfaves icons right on the phone from TZones is awesome
I also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account plan info right on the phone
The only issue I have been having is finding accessories for itmy usual discount accessory shops dont have much yetIm assuming because the phone is so new but Im sure that will getting resolved soon
yes its a tie with the Sony Cybershot K790a for the best multimedia phone so far on the market at least until the iPhone will show up then the game is on again
i am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile contract for 2 more years and got this phone for 100 or drop my previous one and get a new contract
For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travel charger you get a travel charger home charger and a USB cable with driver CD
The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use Windows Media Player to moving music over to your phone using the Sync feature and you can use a free program such as BitPim to didn't other file transfers between your PC and phone
Some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine but they were unable to got the data cable to work
However I found no such problems and successfully used the data cable to transfer files off of my phone
After installing the drivers just search the web for a program called BitPim
Its not exactly the nicest looking software but gets the job done
I got the a data transfer cable the house and car charge cheaper than what I would have paid for the car charger alone
I have been using this piece for the last one year and its quite a decent one
It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed
An ample speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handy at times
I recently had a problem with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by T mobile
If you want a cell phone that is well made looks good feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the V360 is an excellent choice
It has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that I dont want
it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use
I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlockedunbranded and it was of the quadband variety
Durability this thing was built with the clumsy in mind like me
I must haven't dropped this thing a dozen times and theres barely a scratch
MP3 player I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke but with the cost of TranshFlash memory coming down I bought my 512MB chip on eBay for 7
That being said the MP3 player is a feature you will actually USE and the sound quality is good
Ive had no problem with playing my iTunes music as long as theyre mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality then it will play fine
Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats you need to converted them to mp3 or changes the default in either program to rip to mp3 format you can changing the default to mp3 in the settings menu
Programmable smart keys I read where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side it was the camera icon button on the front keypad
He must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the Personalize menu
Not only that but you can rearranged the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps
You may not use these features outofthe box but theyre for the time when these technologies are more commonplace
I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files mp3s pics etc to my phone with my laptop
This phone works on 850 900 1800 and 1900 GSM networks although that has not been personally tested
However I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and Ill know for certain by then
Theres a slight delay when you answer a call I usually have to say hello 23 times or waits a few seconds before I begin to spoke
I dont known if this is a carrier problem or the phone
The light stays on while charging even when the phone is powered off
You really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone
It has a monochrome outer display full color inside
This doesnt bother me at all but its not as flashy as Razr or other phones
This is a great durable little phone with handy features I think people will actually use
Ive read where people complain about the picture quality but thats what a digital camera is for
If you want a good quality cell phone thats well designed user friendly and doesnt look like a trickedout teenagers phone then this is the phone for you
As usual Motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all its more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal
Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual
My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory
Despite having something like five Meg of memory on the phone and a Micro SD memory card thats it
The size of the text message doesnt seem to mattered
This is a great phone that Ive used for a year now
Id like to highlights the standout features that make this phone unique especially at its price
Just gotten an adapter for the usb port a few bucks on eBay and you can pluged in your stereo headphones
Too bad they havent offered an update to the Motorola Digital Audio Player
You can take a MicroSD card put it into the included adapter and plug into an SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtone cropping it will makes it more effective 3GP videos animation looks great but the sound was slightly out of sync search the web for video converters to convert your content or pictures
I love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them
I got an Explorer 320 headset for 20 and it works great with it
Easily slidden off the cover and pop in a fresh one
The battery life isnt very long so its good to hadn't a spare battery theyre cheap
Not high quality video but its something the old RAZR couldnt do
You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the top of the keypad and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone
It even has a shortcut list to lists all your favorite features
You can easily making any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper
Also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique
Good for using automated phone menu systems and when youre put on hold
The speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s
The plastic may resounded at certain sounds though
VIBE THEN RING Why doesnt every phone have this It should be the default standard for all phones
The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket
If you are one to shows off your ringtone let it move onto ring otherwise was descreet and answer immediately

All the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off
I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit
I scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldnt look half worn off

All the great features is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509 or other more expensive phones
This phone just has all the feefree features you could want
if the cell is in my back pocket jean the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up
I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headset and found it more than adequate
The ability of using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect
Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick
So you throw your headset and charged away and buy a new one
Depending on your ear structure the fit can be either formfitting or loose
From reading the other reviews here one can infer this
Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or device it pairs to would make a difference in performance
Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static
For me and others we experienced no such problem
Best bet is to checks the return policy if you find that it doesnt meet your standards
But if it works for your device you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talk time on 1 AAA Alkaline battery
And you will never aren't bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea
If it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner
I can use it daily for an hour or so every day on a single AAA for at least two weeks
It appears from other reviews that this can varied a lot
I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone and a Apple PowerBook G4
On the Apple I can use it as a generic output device
The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away on the Treo 650 the signal is not nearly as good
like driving or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing fullblast OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly then its sometimes hard to hear
the call goes back to my cell phone when the battery is getting low
You can milk it a while longer but thats really your first clue about the battery
The earpiece is OK its not as secure as Id hope
If youre outside in a gust you may want to hang on to it
Also people on the other end sometimes can tell Im on a headset with this one they mention that I sound a little staticky
This is my first bluetooth headset so perhaps my rating is higher just because its a nifty gadget
But the battery life on this is really the winner my workmates have rechargeable headsets and it seems like theyre always having to charge them
I use rechargeable NiMH AAAs and they just last a really long time with this unit
I bought this headset for internet chats with my husband when he travels for business
The sound quality is good volume more than adequate and my husband does not heard any echo
I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a charger
All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies
The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear
It would been nice if it bent for a custom fit but I am pretty happy with it
Easy to pair with my phone Motorola SLVR L7 European Version
Have not had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated
Price affordable but acts like an expensive headset
22 Hours of talk time before battery has to being replaced
I would highly recommending this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best
There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest
Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price
It works beautifully with my Treo 700p smartphone
I love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button making the whole unit quick and easy to storing
The only complaint Ive heard is that the large blue power light is too bright at night
It doesnt annoy me but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down so the blue glow doesnt shone up into her eyes
The retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone
My complaint with all Palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connector and they break
But the price on this one is good enough that you should buys 2
This is an excellent product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hiding its style
I chose Treo because of its unique look and excellent features however the case from Palm didnt work for me because I use the phone a lot and I dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime
So it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it
I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phone while in it it hides the Treos real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag
I loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands anyone who are crazy over that color
had a return and they replaced it no questions asked
Good battery life certainly much better than the old one it replaced
For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original
However it doesnt fit quite as snugly in the dockstyle charger that came with my phone not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly
That is a little annoying that it tends to fallen out if Im not paying attention Ill wake up the next morning and my phone wont actually have been charged but it still works
This battery saved me from renewing the contractthus the battery was a contract killer
I thought I was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49
The product is probably a decent product but it doesnt work in my vehicle 04 Jetta
I think it has to do with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to longing
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving
I couldnt believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price
Everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase
The cable is exactly what I needed and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives
Drivers provided on the accompanying CD worked but were not as complete as I would have liked
I am still very satisfied as it was only the cable that I was really after especially for the price at which I bought it
The vehicle phone charger I received was not the one pictured as for sale
It does however appears to be equal in features
I have now used this product and finding that it does not work to charge my V170 cell phone
I have since purchased the Motorola charger more expensive and it works perfectly
This car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right
You might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind
I am always willing to waiting a little longer and paying a little more if I know what I am getting is not just a counterfeit
After reading reviews here user forums I decided to purchases this
It can charge a secondary battery in the rear compartment AND can charge
the extended life batteries as well while the Q is on the charger
The three color LED indicator is added benefit wa simple guide
The charger can not overcharge the battery which is an added benefit
And you can easily access the Q while on the charger for SMS texts using any app
or even using the speaker phone while on the desktop charger
Motorola should includes this with each Motorola Q phone as standard equipment
Great product works quickly when charging my Moto V555 in the car
I simply wanted a data cable to connect my Verizon cell phone to my Macintosh so I could transfers and synchronize data
Verizon was of no help and wanted to sells me a very expensive package that only worked on Windows machines
This was a WHOLE lot cheaper than the Verizon dealer wanted for this product
My only disappointment was that it didnt have clear instructions which was LGs fault
cover fits great and for the price i could not found anything better was at the local mall and saw a cover that was the same for around 17
I just bought this case a few weeks ago and its holding up very well
Well I hope this thing will last for many months down the tough road
I would like to buy two or more shells do you offers differents colors to choose from wich colors are there this is because i would like to payed only one shipping fee
the case looks great and it is very slim fitting so the phone doesnt look bulk
This was delivered as an OEM product exactly as expected
I bought one of these extended batteries on ebay and was really sorry
I was reluctant to try again but I was glad I did
This time I got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery
I only have to charges the new battery every 2 3 days
I have tried a dozen screen guards some of them shine a lot some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble
And yea the best part is its static not gum and its washable
The touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice
The onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to gotten dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so were very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen easier sad than done
If anything does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer
I have had it for some time now I got it for my 11th birthday
I have reviewed the cingular version too even though mines verizon
Very short battery life I have to charged it almost every day
Camera The picture you take cant move or it comes out all messed up
Recording videos Even though you get 15 seconds I still use that to make funny videos with my friends
Its style I love the color and style My friends are all jealous
Personally I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its functionality you are buying the wrong phone
I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not were as small light and attractive as Motorola phones LG phones are built to last
However if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carrying in your pursepocket and to use just as a nice looking phone this is a great one to own
I previously had the LG VX9800 before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c
I had the VX9800 because when I was in college I would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes
However now that I am in the working world and basically only use my phone to call people I wanted a phone that was easier to carry around and was cute
I dont recommend this phone if your phone is your lifeit doesnt do much
However if you are just going to be using it to making calls and sent the occasional text its wonderful
The pink color that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeousits almost a purpleypinkish lavendar color
In my opinion this pink is prettier than the TMobile magenta and much much much nicer than the Cingular pink I am not a fan of that one at all
In essence if youre looking for a hightech phone this is not it
If youre looking for a lightweight attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting this is a great buy
I just got my pink razr phone and I love it so far
i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones
Even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you can see it still it works well
I was scared to buy this phone because I read some of the reviews and some of them werent saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it
When I first got my Motorola Q I was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or been caught with a dying battery in mid day
With some setting changes and the 1700 mAh battery that is now far in the past
A little fatter than the regular battery which means a very tight squeeze in my Qholder but the extra power makes a big difference
I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protector only but also a squeegeem cloth and cleaning instructions
This shield fits very nicely over my phone screen
My friend from HK just got this phone and asking me to buys her an Eforcity screen protector
Hes been know to showed it off and got his hold phones all scratched up
Its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but I digress
The screen protect works as described it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator
The film has some kind of electrostatic polymer theres no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen
Squeegee help to gets out 1 air bubble that formed
It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when Im using it as a phone
It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse
My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases
Come on guys Women use these items too Also the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that Ive had this case
Other than those two things this is a great not bulky case
it is small and compact easy for travel but also good for home use
I am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone
I would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and getting to when needed
I use my belt holster with all the phones ive owned my i530 is no
This belt holster feels really well made it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard I use it
A big plus is that I can use my phone while its in the holster
works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate and can were used to adapt your lg phone to what ever you wan
An extra Lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone
The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts
I have found the 750 mah Lithium Ion Battery to been dependable nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging
It doesnt weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range
However the first time you charge or recharge your Lithium battery is the most important charge of all
You must let the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery
The deader the battery on its first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come
I am in northern Ohio and travel many places around the state
No matter where I have gone and I take my phone everywhere with me I have yet to found a place where my phone doesnt have Nextel service
I live on a farm here and we use the twoway often to communicated
My phone in particular has been dropped several times once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud
I am extremely happy with Nextels service and phones
I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also cant complain
I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon Alltel Cingular and Sprint
Its a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged from my experience with Sprint they are terrible with no service anywhere and their phones suck too
I have used the i530 for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit or with NEXTELs service
To simplified your reading here is a list of pros and cons
Cons A little chunky Lacks up to date features and tech such as color screen external display etc
Pros Durability been dropped off a roof still going strong Looks yellow model Call quality is excellent Good speakerphone Digital 2way is a great feature
The only issue among the cons that is of any real concern is the battery life but this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones perhaps due to the nature of the iDEN network on which they operate
Even after two years my original battery lasts more than a day with moderate use
A pain Slightly but given the advantages of NEXTEL its worth remembering to charged up more often
Please beware of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below my experience with their coverage customer service etc
Just make sure you do your homework with respect to coverage before you sign up with any wireless company
Go with the one that gives the best coverage in the areas in which you live work or travel
Its always best to actually putting the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone
NEXTELs maps are pretty legit at least as far as I have discovered
For two years now I have not had any problems with my Motorola i530 cell phone which is serviced by TelusNextel
Over all I would rate the service as good not excellent
Rarely I will have trouble getting service in a area where I would normally get a strong signal
This problem will normally last for roughly under a minute before my phone is once again operational
Im a daily commuter between Canada and the United States
My phone doesnt miss a beat it will automatically switches from Telus a Canadian server to Nextel an American server and still have the same great reception
The cell phone itself is big bulky heavy and ugly
It does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or video features
It does has a direct connect feature so you can use your phone like a walkytalky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone
The reception on the phone is clear and crisp it will seldom cutting out of the conversation
Therefore I did not expecting the quality of the sound of down loaded music to be so poor
I have thrown my phone across a room to a friend who failed to caught it more then once
One of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces
On a road trip my phone had fallen off my lap out of the car and sat on the side of the road for three days in the rain
I had recharged the phone and it worked as expected
My phone has never let me down I have always gotten service and the battery has not died on me thus far
The battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderating usage
If you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishment and do not desire all of those new phone gimmicks this phone is for you
i have this nextel it works verry good im verry happy with it
What can I say It works very well I keep this in my car so when I travel I dont have to worried about my Palm TXs batteries
This is the 5th Palm treo case I have bought in the last few years and it is the best by far
It holds the treo snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap
The clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot
I was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protected my Treo 700p but would allows complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it
In other words I didnt want something that was attached to the Treo permanently
There is one complaint sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk
I have the i850 but the i560 is what my wife has been using for about 3 months
The phone is so good my 2 year old cant destroy it hes tried Theres only 3 things I dont like about it it doesnt have a very big screen the external screen isnt color and it has no camera
Other than that its pretty much the same as the higher priced models like the i850
and holding them together I suspect that they in fact have the same electronics inside minus the 3 things I mentioned above
If you dont takes pics this really is the phone for you You can even submerge this thing in water and it will still works without needing anything special It has GPS built in and all the java apps
Its everything the higher priced models have minus the camera and a smaller screen
Even though the screen is smaller its color and very legible
The Motorola i560 is nicely sized easy to use and indestructible
These features are what to looks for when looking for a new cell phone
Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones such as the i710 but it is the unbreakable model with outside display
Size is important especially with Nextel because most of their early models are very big and awkward like the i710
The i560 is perfectly in between massive and tiny
This is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas
It is equipped with gripping as well which helps when it comes to using the direct connect placing calls and receiving calls
It is nice looking but is harder to keep in your hand
More damage is done to the i710 because there is no gripping
If however the i560 does slipped out of your hands dont worry
Dropping this phone is not a concern due to extreme durability
If you are worried about scratching the outside getting a leather or plastic cover for it
The ease of use between the i560 and the i710 is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicity however the big difference is in the outside display on the i560
Without even opening the phone you can placed a call by pushing the stop butt at the top of the phone and scroll through your most recent calls
The i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word where as the i560 is still not perfects in that aspect but an improvement is better than nothing
There is nothing worse than having to take a cell phone in for repair or even worse having to replaced it
As much use as most people get out of their cell phones how it stands up to daily wear and tear is vital to satisfaction with a phone
The i560 is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel and is exceptionally tough
When the i710 is dropped it often goes to a blank screen and causes problems with reception and service
Overall performance mass and resilience of the i560 surpasses the i710
My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with Cingular so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do
Heres a breakdown of the pros and cons so far after a week
Nextels Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear
Any call either DirectConnect or regular call can wasn't made with the flip open or closed
You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them
If youre concerned about radio RF radiation and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore this phone has the extendable antenna to getting the transmission point further away from you and improves the transmission
The speakerphone is as loud as you need it to am even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system very impressive
There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone full duplex
You can also turned its volume down to a whisper if you want to
The phone is a little wider than some phones like the V60 but is very light
Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dials with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my mediumsized hand
Phone has slight hourglass shape wider at the bottom to fits nicely into the hand
Phone has all the standard stuff I love and couldnt live without voice dialing custom rings for calls from my contact list handsfree long recent calls list up to 20 ability to store number to Contacts from recent calls without having to keying the number just have to entering the name
The phone is almost completely made of plastic and Ive never thought plastic was as durable as metal
While Motorola makes truly awesome phones I worry there might was an overreliance on plastic to protecting the insides of the phone
When the phone is in the holster the outside display is not visible forcing me to removing the phone from the holster to seeing whos calling for those that dont have a custom ring configured or to check the time
Very annoying as Im used to using my phone as a watch
The icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might having trouble seeing and interpreting the icons
The only two parts that are clear the battery important and datetime
The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone where you connect the charger etc make me thinks that someday Im going to looked down there and found it missing
Its easy enough to pop off but sometimes takes persuading to put back and have it cover the slot completely because it needs to isn't a snug fit to meet the military spec
OVERALL I really like the phone and highly recommended it to all
The cover design is well made based on the requirements
The problem according to me is the device not be able to avoided the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides
In my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the case
Im a heavy user of GPS Applications and Power Vision for websurfing on the go
I used to charge the phone twice a day now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even forget to plug it in at night and I still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day
Even when i forget to charge it hasnt died on me
This battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone
Talk time and internet time are increased greatly
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast
Though that is still better than the original battery
I have no idea if it is as good as the one Sprint sells for 60 dollars
I just bought this battery at a Sprint Customer Service store and I paid 64
Im going to return it today and buys it online here
Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900 making it less highmaintenance and allowing me to doing some web browsing headset using and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will costs me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time
Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind
Its been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars
What Aside from the piddling cost of this battery which is about double the tax youd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside
To me this is not insignificant but is ignorable as it doesnt detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing talking or using the buttons
The only complaint I had about my a900 was the battery life
I am on conference calls a lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly
With this extended battery I am able to use my headset without having to charges the phone repeatedly
Totally worth the 15 plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping
The Samsung A900 is a great phone a Motorola Razr on steroids
BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL You literally have to charging this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time
NOT ANY MORE The Bargaincell price was so low I was skeptical
PERISH THE THOUGHT I got the battery on time it was VERY well packaged
It fit the phone PERFECTLY as did the COVER it came with
I then used the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge WHOO HOO BRAVO BARGAINCELL
BY THE WAY Even though this is a somewhat thick battery it is SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE It does NOT add the bulk you might thinking looking at its picture
In fact I think the phone actually looks BETTER with the larger battery
I have a leather Bytech carry case designed for the RazrA900
Its a tight fit now but Im sure the case will stretching much like a new shoe does after its been worn a few days
The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid battery life
And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint
Nobody wants to charge their phone between 24 times a day
With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times
So of course I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial
Be sure to gets this one because it was the cheapest I found and I did extensive searching
Also this one comes with the door which is very crucial
Ive seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door
You would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery
What would you did putting a rubber band around it Heck no
Well anyway now that I have this battery my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries
My A900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little
Dont worry youre phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all its features without dying
I initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained aboutuntil I applied the FIX Palm has identified that the Treo 680 device can experience reduced battery life when the camera is used
The camera may continuing to draw power from the battery when the device is in standby mode
680 users should install the Treo 680 Camera Update to addresses this issue
I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months Including Cingular HTC 8125 and Nokia E62 and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned
The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system albeit less powerful and much more customizable and synchronizationfriendly than the Symbian OS
Very customizable interface making the phone very user friendly
You can sets any application or any number to dialing as a preset button
Palm OS is easy to use and thus you actually got to took advantage of the many features of the phone unlike Windows Mobile which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS but cumbersome and difficult to use at times
very important for people like me who like to drive and textemail
Perfect size weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear
The lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement
Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop
Can sets the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you which is very useful although limits battery life
Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones
I have to charge my phone every night and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet 30 minutes of mp3 player autoretrieve email every 30 min and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions
If you have it set on autoretrieve for your email the battery life seems to decreasing impressively
The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently
You cant plug in your own headsets into the device like your iPod headphones you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can getting it from Palm
I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm instead of from Cingular
I got it for 350 with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included
Also if you get it from Cingular they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone
OVERALL extremely satisfied with this easy to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter battery life
I had a Palm TX which I loved but didnt like having to go to WiFi sites for the web
I also had a Moto V557 phone which is the best cell phone Ive ever owned
I purchased the Treo for the best of both worlds
I like the Treo 680 but I had to reading all of the instructions call customer service and practice using certain features to not are frustrated with the phone
For example I had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button
Which I usually missed while in a rush to answering the phone
I like the web because its fast enough that I dont miss the WiFi
I had to got used to the fact that many web sites arent small enough for the phone but its excellent for using Google maps looking up business and giving the number for easy dial just tap the blue line checking bank accounts online orders movies weather and especially the news
I absolutely love the chat setting on the messaging
People typically tells me that they cant hears me so I now use a corded ear bud
The Bluetooth doesnt work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately
You cant insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dials extensions
There is no way to deleted one digit at a time if you misdial a number
You have to leaves the phone dialing page and return to redial
The phone dials slowly if there are other programs running
And lastly you cant check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone
You have to hang up with the person unlock the phone check the calendar and call them back
The battery life is poor but I keep a charger in the car which helps a great deal
I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommend
They are Launcher Xexcellent Mobil Write Treo Voice Dialing The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows
I also recommend that you keep you Treo locked with a security password
I have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this 400 phone
It had more memory than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated
From my research I discovered a few things that needed to is done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours
1I had to applied a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th
2 I needed to completely drains my battery until there was nothing then charging it for 24 hours
Once I did these two things my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge and Ive sets my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive
This is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive
Ive had no problems with any of my SD cards or miniSD cards
The increase internal memory also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo
Ive heard the various complaints but you have to work through some of them
Upgrading from the Treo 650 it is true that there isnt much new
Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and nonmegapixel camera leave one frustrated
But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee
So I accept the current Palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries
That doesnt mean that I wont tell Palm Guys getting your act together and come out with something far better
I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didnt want to looking like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear
I took a chance on this headset even though I read a review saying that it didnt sync up well with the VX8300
Even though it is smallabout 112 the buttons are still large enough to use with ease
It also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works well with my VX8300
the headset is great works really well with my samsung phone
the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear but its really great and i would buying it agai
Well I read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here but I decided to take the plunge and go for it
All I can says is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the getgo
It has its flaws but what phone doesnt The question is whether youre going going flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you
Most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me
My area has good Tmobile coverage so I cant complain
It also pairs with my bluetooth headset Plantronics 510 really well
99 plan and yes EDGE isnt the fastest but it gets the job done
It doesnt matter where Im at I can check my email finds restaurants or directions or just surfing the web when Im bored
It really came in handy when I was out on vacation and lost
Didnt want to fork out the money for hotspots though
No its not going to replace my regular camera but I found it really handy when I forgot to take my camera to my friends wedding but was still able to take quality pictures
Mp3Video player Now the speakers on this phone arent the greatest so I wouldnt use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headset it sounds pretty good
I bought a 2GB microSD card bought here at Amazon and now I can holds a ton music and movies
This thing is my travelinig entertainment center
I even found a way to played original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying Mike Tysons Punchout like back in the old days
Calendarschedule I had a PDA but for some reason Im more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedule on this thing than I did with my Pocket PC
Smartphone applications Im in the medical field and I keep all my medical applications on this phone
I can quickly looks up drug references or research diseases
I really thought Id need a touchscreen in order to better navigating these programs and while it might am slightly easier with a stylus I dont finding that its all that necessary and still navigate pretty well
I just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps but its more than adequate
And Im not sure why people dont think there are a lot of programs for the smartphone
Programs written for WM5 are compatable with PPC as well as smartphones equally
Appearance Everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do I
I saw this side by side with the Motorola Q and the Q just looked so much bulkier and
Battery For all that I use this phone for it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spared which is all I can really ask for
I wouldnt went 2 days without charging the battery though
Windows Mobile 5 Mighty Microsoft needs to write a cleaner program
However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will is free to download for TMobile customer soon so hopefully thatll take care of some of the problems
I swear just to turn on the bluetooth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate WM5
Adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best
Luckily my musicvideo programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjusting the volume so its not such an issue for me
Alarm clock Now I dont use this all that much but I see what everyone says about it and yeah its a pretty idiotic written program
However rather than writing half a page on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now goes on
Summary So I use this device to made quality phone calls surf the web check email play games listen to music watch movies monitor my schedule check my medical references and taken decent quality pictures
All this thing needs now is a laser beam that will cutting through metal and itd be the greatest gadget known to man
When I got this phone I gave my PDA to my brother and my Razr to my daughter
I love the full contact list with addresses all the phone numbers and notes that are in my Outlook and it syncs with Outlook
The calendar is really nice and that too syncs with Outlook
I dont try to use it for browsing the internet but I do use Tmobiles Tzones to collect all my email from all my various email address types
It took some learning to find the easiest way to get to everything but its there is you look called and received numbers with one key press extremely easy contact looks up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a push or two away
It has EVERYTHING that any cell phone has and works as well or better and easier
The speaker phone is great and one touch or speed dialing is great
I can store hundreds of phone numbers at numbers I choose then use the spot number to make a call instead of looking up numbers ie Lees cell is spot 5 home spot 15 office spot 25 I found a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phone
Some areas I have service where friends with other providers dont and some areas they have service I dont
All in all I find that I have service across the country without much trouble and I drive
If you have Tmobile cell service their tzones for email and many other internet based services is only 5 and WiFi service is only 20 monthly cant beat that
The full keyboard makes text messaging and keeping notes MUCH easier and more fun
Its not a full PDA but it does everything I did with my PDA
Its way more than a phone really small and thin easy to carry easy to lock and unlock the keyboard
It takes nice pictures for emergencies if I dont have my camera and it uses a mini SD card which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos
Personally I cant think of a negative thing about it
Its not a laptop computer but I think its the best cell phone on the market
My cousin has the blackberry and hes jealous of me and my Dash
Ive had multiple PDAs that have crashed and multiple phones in the past
I had a great Nokia phone but wanted to combining into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago
Been able to makes and receive phone calls call clarity is excellent and with TMobile I have service in my office unlike other coworkers phones
Everyone is jealous their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking
I really enjoy having the email and internet feature
The only issue Ive had at all is with the volume control when Im surfing the net or playing ball breaker I hold the phone and often hit the volume control
Everything else works as described and Im very happy with my choice
When I was looking to combine my phones I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews I picked this one
This is my first SmartPhone and Ive had a lot of fun with it so far
For being so small the keys are remarkably easy to use
If you have Windows XP along with MS ActiveSync 4
0 your PClaptop will recognize it as a network device
A little bonus app on the Dash lets you share the Internet connection granted you have the data plan at no extra cost
If you get the addon micro SD card about 80 youll have no need to buys an iPod
Windows Media Player which comes standard works just as well
When Im in range of wifi I can use Skype and saves my minutes
I hope TMobile doesnt read this since theyll probably patch that loophole
The battery charge doesnt last longer than a day or so if youve got data push to Outlook enabled
The volume strip on the righthand side drives me nuts
When I do an annoying popup interrupts whatever Im doing
You can disable the volume strip but its kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player
A simple classic volume dial on the side would aren't a huge improvement
The strip never seems to working right when I really intend to adjust the volume
The keyboard is nice but a touch screen would isn't better for certain apps
I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable
Right now I have a 140000 word dictionary on it the NIV bible Star Wars many videos of my son about 100 wma songs and a ton of pictures
It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts appts tasks and emails are always up to date
It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset
It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy
I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price
I like it waaaay better than the treo blackberries Q or any other qwerty device
The MPT version is Ok but more value is for seem editing for professional and expert users only
The headset works fine people who I talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well but I doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset
After trying this phone out a few days here are my personal results
What attracted me to this phone were the fitness features flip phone design and the rugged design
You have to calibrating it manually if you want the best results but right out of the box its been okay so far
Ive had other mp3 cell phones LG VX8500 Chocolate Samsung SCHA930 Motorola SLVR L7 and this one blows all of the others out in this category
Granted this is not going to contend with the iPod but for a cell phone the Walkman abilities are impressive
But then I guess almost anything is an upgrade over the Verizon OS
The length of the headphones cord is way too long for running at least for me personally
Its taken me a few times to figure out something comfortable in terms of cord management
My hands arent big by any means but I still have trouble with some of the dedicated buttons Walkman Internet Shortcuts Power OnOff
I said I dont use the camera feature often and im glad I dont for this camera
This has the be the most stripped down barebones 2 megapixel camera I have used
Overall I must say that I am satisfied with my purchase Im still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phone
I had the choice between this and the W810i for the same price at the Sony Store and I opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and I must say that these two features havent let me down yet otherwise I wouldve gone for the W810
So I welcome myself to the more powerful world of the Cell Phones
Ive been a fan of Sony Ericssons phones after Ive seen what they really do and when I had the Z500a long time back when I won the phone during hurricane season I thought the phone was great
My only thoughts were that despite the phone being a Flip Phone and having a Music Player that the phone only had 15MB of space to begins with and to top it off its camera wasnt great
I have already made a few quick station buttons on the W710 and the best part is that I feel original with the fact that Im the only one that has it in my school and among my friends
Most people Ive seen the only chance they have is getting the W810 and while that phone looks ok the W710 just fits me right
The phones color scheme the style of the phone the phones technogeekness for those of us who love technology and the fact that many people namely the girls find it a cute phone Dont know weather that is good or not but at least it attracts some attention
The fact that the phones user interface is for the most part the same as every phone from SE it makes it that much easier to learn the phones buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old Z500
With 2GB of expanded memory that I put in it and the phones already 17MB of internal space the phone has many possibilities And the last part before I go is that with the fact its an Active phone you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day checkering your training and more It even gives you rewards for being active
So for those needing a nice looking phone want walkman power for mp3s and FM Radio knowing your fitness activity this is the phone for you
Note I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710is features work in comparison
I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function
My sons Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not
Ive also purchased the z710i for my son and will reviewed that one later
Excellent voice quality with headsets wired or bluetooth
shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features
Ability to buy an international SIM card to avoids extra fees
Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable if you dont have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big
FM radio reception is soso in the downtown area
standard or flight mode option to use while on airplane
The international charger with an adapter for US outlets
Inability to synced with any computer using Windows Vista Im sure a workaround is coming
I havent used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounters accuracy
Others have warned about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna I havent had a problem with this
Since I have other Sony phones I am disappointed that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger
Translation you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones
There is no way to charge the phone and use the wired headset
You either listened to the radio or charge the phone
You can not use the standard overthecounter headsets because there is no outlet for it
Need to switches settings to view more than one email account
Yet another memory card format microanother adapter needed
picture caller id only works after you open the phone edit March 212007 if you have answer on open set
I purchased my W710i from an internet company for 254
00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days
Overall Sony has always produced quality products
I love this phone and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone
If you dont needing the bells and whistles of a smartphone go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender
If I could rate it more than 5 stars I would even though I havent tried all of the features of this phone
When it hit the clip battery cover and battery scattered in different directions on the floor
The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone
I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again
The mp3 player is simple to use accessible while the phone is closed and sounds great
You can use any headsets or earbuds you prefer and the radio makes it the device of choice for gymrats or runners alike
Sturdy fairly easy to figure out and fine reception
A great phone if you dont need smartphone features
Sony Ericsson W710i is a very nice cell phone 85090018001900 GSM pedometer bluetooth gprs IR 2Mpix camera mp3 player 512 MB included and so on
The original battery never lasted an entire day if I talked very much
With this replacement battery I never run out of power anymore
The battery is a little bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip
The new battery comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly
When I looked at my bill Amazon did not closes out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular
So Cingular tried to charging me some liquidation fee of 30
I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offering
I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned
The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didnt intend but its really not that big of a deal I just need to retrain my hands
I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality
The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
This phone is incredible and Im so happy I bought it through Amazon
very good deal and smooth transaction I definitely recommend getting this phone
even in places that were dead zones with my other phones
Only a few backgrounds ringtones to choosing from without downloading your own
I also bought the data cable package through Amazon and it worked beautifully from the first try
I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations
I will tried to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews
With the cable that came with my girlfriends V3i I have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone
There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not transfer blah blah blah but there have been only very few songs with any problem
I have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2GB mico card I bought and it has been great
The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for the size
Playlists will also continue to play when the phone is closed which I found a very nice and convenient touch
I reupped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal reception which is nothing to sneezed at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR so I didnt have some POS crap phone prior to the KRZR
As with RAZRs you have to isn't careful not to hit the internet button i wish you could locked keys like on Nokia but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that
I wish Motorola provided you with a disk full of programs INCLUDED with the phone like I was able to got with my Nokia 7610 but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself
Some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on RAZRs and KRZRS but for an average size guy with average sized hands this has not been a problem at all
I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wirelesss New Every Two program
My main gripe with the phone is that unlike my former phone Motorola V265 it can not was set to display the time in the 24hour format I do not use ampm
Otherwise the screen is nice and bright its easy to use its much less bulky than my former phone and the voice activation is easier
Works for me as I dont use the phone for internetemail or use lot other features
Advanced video captures decent zoom and playback ability
Great for travel with excellent sounding MP3 player integrated Bluetooth ready and big hard drive for tunes
Its thin easy to dial through and see through easy to gotten it on and off
before i dropped the phone and cracked the screen
I HAVE dropped it since getting this cover and it was just fine
Ive used this model headset for 6 months and the sound quality is great
I drive a truck for a living and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck
The earpiece can was straightened slightly to minimise discomfort
Only problem is it disconnects sometimes at rest
It beeps when it disconnects and reconnects automatically usually within a minute or two
I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product but thats not to say that that the product is not without some flaws
The reception clarity and battery life is quite good
Also my hearing isnt the greatest and loving the fact that you can turns up the volume on this unit and dont have to strains to hear
My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit
Ive gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on but its still very annoying at times
Even with this slight annoyance I would definitely buy this product agai
I just got the cable and the software for my Motorall V600 and its very easy to use
I just did a backup of all my contacts pics and music
Is Good protecs every corner of your phone the keyboard and the screen Its very good 100 Recomendation
I really like the fit and function of this Cingular 8125 case
All the holes are in the correct location and the belt clip is comfortable no sharp edges to irritate
I ordered 2 other cases elsewhere that did not fitting properly and I sent them back
Shipping was also quick 34 days My only complaint is that sometime it is hard to gotten into the phone and the cord is only about 3 feet long wish it was longer
Soft leather attractive look and very easy to use
Overthetop strap easily secures blackberry in place
Blackberry can easily is slid in and out of the holster
I purchased this with my brand new blackberry 8703e and have not observed a single scuff or scratch on the device after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holster
The only potential negative is the plastic belt clip starts to dug into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time
This is the prettiest one I think There are other pinks but they are tacky
It keeps my phone from getting scratched up and its really cute
Although the i607 BlackJack was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectly
The earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button to answer a call
Even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly
good product for how cheap i got it for absolutely nothing wrong with it
I travel a lot so something like this I would use to replace all my other USB cables
I forget which seller I purchase from but its small lightweight and shoudl ship quick
Not looking to spend the cash for Bluetooth but need something to work This is it
With the extra button you can answer put a call on hold or hangs up without fumbling for your phone
I really dont opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly
The sound quality is really good and people on the other end can hear me quite well
I had ordered this case just for my wife and it fit like a glove
We both have Sprints Katana and you can not finds a better case at its price
I bought this for my Sanyo Katana phone which is a bit thicker than the Razr
My only problem is that due to the design I sometimes accidentally push the buttons on the side of the Katana when I take it out of the case
I love this phone cover it looks amazing I am concerned how long the rhinestones will staying attached
This cover is what my baby blackberry needed to am not protected and safe
The cradle has 2 cords a 110v power cord thats just for charging the spare battery and a usb cord for chargingsyncing the 8125
I just bought this headset for use with an LG VX8300
The stereo headset lets you listen to music and talking on the phone has microphone built in
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to been
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increased the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to did
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone
0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past No problems what so ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegance
The flipphone factor lets you talk comfortably and safely with the antena safely away forms your brain
The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevented any scratches
AMAZING battery life surprising for an MP3 phone
I have had it for a week now and it works flawlessly
I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phone before but I am really happy
The Camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great reception
Definetly a phone to picked up if you are looking for a new one
This phone form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Microtm M2tm NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone
It also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand
But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera
It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated
The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to getting use to not covering it with your finger
The way the phone is shaped you want to holding the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can loses reception
so you just have to remember that when talking to someone
The inside screen is really really bright I turned it all the way down to saving the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell
The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too especially if you ride the bus and listening to a lot of music
this is the 2nd SE phone after T637 and this phone is just better
using it with TMobile it works pretty well as phone and modem
voice the strongest part the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years the speakerphone is OK not so loud
reception another strongest part with TMobile it can get some weak signal when all other dont getting signal at all however the antenna is located at the top back where the loop is touching this part will lose reception
operation typical SE style pretty easy for SE users 3 dedicated buttons web messaging task
cam excellent even though it doesnt have autofocus like K750 and K790 it looks pretty good even its better than nokia 6270
bt very easy to use and pairs with pc suite installed file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake the transfer speed is 300400kB this is the maximum of bt 2
screen the main screen is pretty bright even I have to setting the brightness down animated standby screen is simply cool external screen however is monochrome it maybe a plus when using outdoors the main is barely viewable under sunlight it display info only its a kinda inconveient when doing selfpic
audio player I seldom use it because it doesnt support ogg vorbis which I mainly use streaming audio supports real only no shoutcast
conclusion this phone is a pretty good phone for the price quadband is a must for Cingular users fast EDGE modem for web and tethering
no default USB mode always asks when plug in kinda annoying
They shipped quickly kept me updated and the cables arrived well packaged
Cable is cheap works perfectly and arrived quickly
All you have to does is download the software from the samsung website and plug it in
When I ordered this item I already knew it didnt come with the driversoftware cd but minutes after I ordered it DLN sent me an email telling me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me the link
im kind of bummed that that charge feature doesnt work on my phone D807 but thats just an issue with my phone I guess and nothing with the product
Reason 1 It keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data trust me this helps when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loosing reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone
Reason 2 Only data that can was played by your cell phone gets transferred so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car
You will have to use windows media player to sync this phone Samsung Sync SGHA707 in order to transferred files
MP3 and WMVWMA formats work with this phone i do not know whether other formats work or not
Let me explained in brief how to synced this phone with windows media player
Connect one end of the cable to your phone first and the USB end to your computer USB port Preferably USB 2
If you have already inserted media card into the phone you will saw two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open My Computer on your computer
Now open Windows media player you will are able to see the following tabs just below main menu
From left to rights you will be able to see in this order Now Playing Library Rip Burn Sync and Guide
Make sure your Cell phone is connected now you will see two halves in the same window left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to were transferred and right half is where it goes your cell phone name apears on the top usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file this takes a while
Also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory
Once you are well versed with what your phone can played i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB readerwriter as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer this saves you a chunk of time and battery power
This cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere
I received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an email to let me known where to download the appropriate program free from the Samsung website
I ordered this USB cable for my Samsung SYNC and it came fast
While there is no software provided I quickly found out it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could added music to my phone
After searching I found that Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for FREE If you want to fully utilize your Syncs camera and MP3 capabilities I highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to Samsungs site for the free software

If you own a Q you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible
This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery which is great
So I can charging my phone with the standard battery and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot
Also it makes a wonderful stand for the phone and when hooked to the USB cable you get data conectivity too
Only downside it wont charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged
The plugs fit fine I got the 2 pack and I get STEREO sound through both headphones
If you do not hadn't headphones with the proper impedance you will NOT get stereo sound
My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony isolation headphones work fine with this adapter
Maybe Im just lucky but for this low price this adapter is fine
If you want sterling sound you shouldnt be listening to mp3 anyway
I can hear the limitations of my files on the treo so its clearly good enough
This is the kind of thing you dont cares about unless it malfunctions
It seems sturdily built and unlikely to break easily
The rightangle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device A problem with straight plugs
It doesnt seem to have been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well
I wondered if the snap on concept would feeling and look secure
Its rock solid and looks like its part of the phone
Additionally the extra protection it provides to the little screen is wonderful
Id love to bought more colors whenif they become available
I am very surprised how well this case fitted my Razr V3M
Great for the price vs buying it from your cell phone company
The cable works great with my SGH707 but the cd did not haven't the right driver
However you can download the correct driver from samsung
I recomend to buys the cable and then download the driver for your phone
The cable was perfect exactly what I needed but it took way too long over ten days to get here
Holds the phone in an attractive snug leather case Clips to belt and holds tight
Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical I dont have trouble catching it on things
Ive broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car
The phone would caught on something and the plastic clip would snaps
This case works great and eliminates that problem The perfect solution
The L2 uses the same case so they both fit within this rubber case
However the keys are laid out differently on the L6 so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys
I didnt give it a low rating because its well built and is actually a really great product just wanted to give other L2 owners a warning
It works well but its just a little funky on an L2 but totally usable
For the price you just cant beat it and its a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket
Even though the keys are covered it is still pretty tactile
Would have liked something to protecting the screen
After about a year the ear support on this Bluetooth headset broke
Good news it has a 2 year warranty and Logitech is replacing it with a Mobile Traveller model since the Mobile Freedom is no longer made
Contact Logitech Tech Support Audio by phone cant am done over the web
Its nice to see a company stand behind their products
Works great its a bit bigger than some headsets but in this case I feel thats a good thing the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you dont get a feedback loop where the person youre talking to hears themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker
The only complaint would am I wish the volume went up just a bit more it can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly
the hole to plug the charger into is under the thing that holds it onto your ear it rotates out of the way
It took me awhile to finding it when I first got it
To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either
Feedback loop Where the other person hears themself speak
Ambient noise The other end hears everything around you especially in a car
In minimizing these the Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best
Ive tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without extraneous noises
As for me I hear everyone fine on all the headsets but a conversation is a twoway street and if youve ever used a headset Im sure youre tired of hearing Take me off that stupid thing
The negatives with this headset are far outweighed by the call clarity
Yes its big and ugly but your friends will thanks you
The other negative to am not aware of although I assume this is more due to the age of my headset as its only recently started doing this is that Ive found is that after 1 year while the battery still holds a charge well it sometimes drops the link to the phone when I hang up after a call and I cant get it back until I recharge the thing
Overall if I was going to buying a new one Id get this one
As far as the other 3 tested Ill ranked them in order of call quality best to worsting
Plantronics Discovery 655 not too bad but hard to keep in your ear
Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX more for wireless stereo headphones than for calling
Motorola HS850 Looks cool but a total piece of garbage
If youre wondering why I have 4 headsets its because theres nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone
Ive had several gens of the candybar blackberries 7100 nice but receptionmike was horrendous 7130 much better finally nailed it
Was dubious when I had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky
Slightly smaller than 7130 which oddly does make a difference like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something
Makes my partners Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison
The pearl trackball is just fine like it better than roller actually
Reception mike quality are also good despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130
Writing is good too the suretype continuing to were so durn accurate I sometimes forget to checking
So I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone the one that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great
If you need bulletproof email PDA and phone this is yr baby
Slightly shorter battery life but hasnt stranded me yet
My first blackberry and I love it I wanted to stop lugging around a phone AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to having contacts calendar and tasktodo list
I wanted a phone that synched with Outlook and was a great phone
I didnt really care about internet music or camera but the cheapest 30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly its just great I bought the 40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it
I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and its GREAT to am able to instantly recognize whos calling from the music
Camera is ok not great but ok and very nice to has for onthespot photos that you dont want to lugged around the regular digital for
I actually emailed a picture on the spot very cool
However Im not a heavy user and I used the profiles to having phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day
Only cons so far are 1 getting used to the keypad believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word
Ive followed other folks advice and dont really look at the words letter by letter i type a sentence and then looking it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word
Still this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim
2 Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone I have to reseat the battery to gets the change to take effect
3 Volume when talking even on speakerphone is average not terrible but ok
4 I also wonder how long the track ball will last Im not a heavy user and I still use it constantly
I think im going to buy the insurance plan just in case
These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more
Its true what some say Im a crackberry because playing with this thing is addictive
Ill updated this review again in 3 months or so but I dont anticipate any problems
My only regret is I didnt hold out until a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosk
Top line This is the best BlackBerry Ive ever used and among the best phones Ive ever used
I can use it at work and after hours with out compromise in functionality and stylesize
Ive been some what grudgingly using Blackberry since the first pagerstyle 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthrough for me
Finally I have a corporate device that treats me like a consumer
Great voice dial particularly if you are a commuter with a headset
No need to recording your voice for each address entry just say who you want to calling and it it doesnt understand you it will prompting you for more info
Size and appearance Finally I dont look like a dork talking to something the size of my palm
The phone is as small as many phoneonly candy bars
Easy private email setup as with all modern BlackBerries
Seems to having some sort of auto setup for Mac mail and Gmail others too I imagine
Macintosh compatibility I just bought The Missing Sync for Apple Mac OS X 40 USD to synchronized my address book calendar tasks and notes from my MacBook Pro
Works great The software provided by RIM is not very easy to use
Fantastic screen and innovative Outlook Today style summery screen for missed calls latest emails etc
Look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with the phone
As others have mentioned the keyboard is very good
Coming from a full size BB keyboard I thought I might miss it but the 8100s is a breeze to use
Speaker phone is functional and sound quality in general is fine
I think I have a minor voice quality issue between the phone and my Motorola H700 headset the best headset Ive ever owned
More Mac compatibility would be appreciated like native iSync and bluetooth support
In fact this is the first cell phone Ive had where I had a data plan setup
I got ta say Im luving it My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop
The browser is very robust and seems to work great
Ive installed a few extra applications google maps bbweather and Yahoo go to naming a few and I havent had any problems
The applications cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful
I still have yet to try the Opera browser for the BB
The camera is so clear with and without the flash its scary
Ive discovered that the moniker CrackBerry is so true
Im just hooked on getting emails surfing the web and listening to some tunes all from the same device at the same time
Ive discovered a whole community of simmilar BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of this device
The pearls suretype keyboard learns as I go and words it didnt got right at first it now picks up and selects as I type
I dont even need to censor the typing too often anymore
I stuck with the suretype mode and caught on to it right quick
This may am not because Ive never used any other type of mobile device keyboard prior to the pearl
My only complaints are that the mp3 player will not play through a wireless headset
You can trick it into doing so but normal play is only through the speaker on the device or through the wired headset
Also the speakerphone is a bit muffled as the battery cover actually covers up the speaker Now there are after mod kits that have an oem battery cover with a hole for the speakerphone but come on
Finally the vibration of the phone is kind of weak
Overall this device is great for beginners like myself
I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device
Its stylish beautiful small and it has some awsome features
However since i bought it from Amazon Cingular took forever just to approve me and gave me a new number
So I constantly had to calling amazon and asks them about my order
Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didnt want to works
So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card
Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me sets up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL
Overall Amazon should been more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasnt easy
But whatever I love shopping Amazon and I truly loving my phone and I bet you will loving it too
Ive had this phone for about a week now and Im glad I waited to posts a review because my initial reaction was not very positive
Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windowsbased devices there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions
Also I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognized what you were attempting to typified
My motivation for purchasing was primarily to gets a PHONE first with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the device
Loading ringtones a pain at first proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research
The music player is MUCH better than first impressions would led you to believe
After a few hours of frustration I was all ready to purchased a 3rd party app
Again did some research visited a few forums and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize
As an owner of a NANO I was disappointed with the interface of the player
But once you go into the menu functions youll find much more functionality
Its not an ipod but it works as an decent replacement
And if youre not an ipod owner youll likely have no complaints
Sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones
Camera is only soso but I dont really care about that anyway
Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera
The couple of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy
As far as email I have a BB from work and they wont let me use a nonwork issued device to access the network so I have no opinion on email functionality
Organizer features calendar tasks notes etc seem more than adequate
The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I havent been able to figures out and while Im admittingly not a techie these should weren't pretty basic and intuitive
One I would likes to set one of my ringtones as the default ringer
That should aren't fairly simplistic but I cant figure it out
Two I would likes to change the order of the icons on some of the themes
Almost forgot cant listen to music through bluetooth
Not sure why but this is really my only MAJOR complaint
And BTW form factor and looks are simply the best out there
I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack very happy that I went with the Pearl
UPDATE Figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons
Coming from a Windows mobile environment I was expecting something along the lines of Startprogramsetcetc
I was simply expecting it to isn't much more difficult based on my prior experience
Im going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo
Otherwise as close to a perfect device as Ive used and Ive used quite a few
This is my first BlackBerry phone and I must say its an awesome device My husband has a BlackBerry through his work so I got one too
How we can PIN each other keep in touch via email etc
The Pearl has wonderful reception great style great features etc
It had a few issues but generaly speaking it worked well
Unfortunately one of my big concerns was the phone size
When I first Bought it I did not think it woud be a big deal
But after having it for a while it felt like I was carring a brick in my packet If you are an smart phone user then you know what I am talking about
I wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size
I was debating between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearl
At first I thought it would not haven't the same capabilities of a palm Q or bjack but I had it for 3 months now and to telling the truththere is so many advantages on this phone I do not misses my palm at all
The pearl not only does not haven't the flaws that palm does but also has the same or more capabilities and browsing speed
The trackball works way better than a touchscreen
So far I am very happy with my purchase that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack
The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring a phone and not a brick in my packet
Not sure about it then do not believe me simply checked the reviews of all smarth phones online
You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other smart phones
This product was perfect all I needed to moving pictures from my phone to my pc
neat cable good connectors but havent established communications between PC and cellphone with cable yet
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt are happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increased the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to pressured
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to done
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should hasn't paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to saw if theres a way to remove these somehow
I have had it for six months and it is the best one I have ever had
I like it so much that I dont wan na gets rid of it
This phone is great I got it for Christmas and it works like a charm The loud speaker is excellent and the ringtones are cool
Some of the wallpapers are a bit weird but they have nice ones too
The ringtones are loud and you can easily hears it ringing
the LCD screen is big and the menus are easy to navigates
The buttons are a comfortable size and I love this phone
So far I havent found any flaws at all and the phone has great battery life
I had to kept it on for a few hours and the bars stayed the same I highly reccomend this phone to any who like it
The phone is light weight and small and it doesnt get in the way I love this phone and have encouraged someone to gets one already
Even though it doesnt have a camera Id say that it is still great As for the cons
I can not thought of any and anyone who says that you can not hearing it ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong company
Virgin Mobile is great but not designed for those people who are on their phones all day
I bought this little phone 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it
I got it to kept with me when Im driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now
It has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever costs in dollars
What I like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can isn't easily tucked inside pockets or small bags
It charges fully in a very short time under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that
It holds that charge for a very long time as I just found out recently
Driving to an appointment I was running late and needed to call to let them knows
Id forgotten to recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to is dead as a doornail
To my delight it turned right on and I made the call with no problems
The Virgin prepay plan is perfect for users like me and ends up costing about 6 a month
Tell me theres something better and Ill say prove it
I looked long and hard to find the best possibility and this was it
For a nice dependable insurance type phone I couldnt wasn't more pleased and genuinely recommending it
This phone is great It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the low ringtone problem by searching for audiovox 8610 hack over the internet
You can purchase a cable on ebay and dl some free softwares over the net
Then you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free
Of course you have to be computersavey to do so
So dont do it unless you know what youre doing
The phone allows 20 seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone
The cool thing is that each ringtone can be attached to a phone number in the phonebook so you know whos calling by the ring
I downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from the net and mix n matched them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones
example 3 stooges sound bell ring whistle homer doh wolf howl all in one 20 second ringtone
I also made some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well
I noticed some songs and soundeffects are louder than others
Thus I only keep the loudest ringtone and theyre very loud I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the ring in my pocket and backpack
Overall this phone is always on sale at places like Target
If you can make your own ringtone and download it into the phone you can have all the free custom ringtones you could ever dreams of
I have to admit if you want more from prepaid Virgin Mobile is a rip off
But if youre only going to use your phone once in a while then its alright
I bought my Audiovox about a year or two ago and it was a good investment
Sleek phone outer dsiplay the calls were good quality and I never would gets dropped calls
Furthermore the color display is great and the battery life is amazing
The phone has all the basic features looks great and is practical for anyone whos not looking for anything outrageous like cameras or Mp3
I have also say that despite the service Vmobile has good phones
But now that Im needing my phone more and more Im ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the whole 25 cents a minute and 10 cents after that is too expensive
And for their new promotions those hardly last and are only for new customers
The ringtones are a little pricey but still reasonable test messaging is available at 10 cents good price
If you want to getting more features minutes whatever I say look into other prepaid offers like net10 tracphone or Tmobile
You get more prepaid with tmobile but the phones with good stuff will cost you a bit more
im also 14 yrs old and ive owned this phone for about 2 months
but i couldnt switch my carrier and it was waayyy expensive
so i looked for a fone that is great for texting and i wouldnt have to pay alot for texting
the only thing is it doesnt have an mp3 player nor a camcorder
also it is a bit bulky and it doesnt have as much features as the enV
this fone has instant messaging and multimedia messaging
virgin mobiles service is good but i have to be honest i do not use this fone to talk but only to text
u dont have to am not a teenager to have this fone but this fone is ideal for a textcrazed teenager
i jus found out that kyocera has a new upcoming fone
I bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago so I got a good deal on it
Well as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard
Other than that I have had no problems call reception is great
The camera on this phone isnt the greatest but I dont needing it to be high end for the basic fun pics I take
If youre looking to get zoom in larger clearer pictures this isnt the phone for you
The camera screens can am a bit confusing but Ive learned to deal with it my pics come out as I like
A strange feature is the speakerphone while it is quite loud clear Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound
The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for txting but may am not too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small
As far as plans are concerned I dont have any problems w over charges since I have the 18 centsmin plan
Its good to known that the monthly plans arent recommended though
A bonus to the per minute plans is the Sugar Mama service where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips
Good for purchasing games or ringtones wo using up your topup money
And this cell isnt only for the young crowd Im an over 25 mom
I got this phone bc other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones those that do required addtl internet service plans like Blackberrys Black Jack Palm TREOs
I only wanted to easily sent txts have it in one compact phone
I can say I have been a realtor a nursean HR person a mom
I remember my first digital phone and first pnone with games
I have had a total of 5 phones motorola nokia ericson panasonic
I dont want a treo palm because I already travel with a lap top
What I want is a text phone that is small and easy to use
The menu is just like a computer and easy to making selections
The more features you need on the phone the more you want a qwerty key board
Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it
Very sturdy little phone and the antena is the loop so it wont poke you
Comes with a very easy to reading guide book so starts up is easy
I paid 199 for this phone in my region and it is worth every penny
I have a Motorola V220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month
The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally which is nice in that it does not blocked the second outlet
Its fairly light weight and made of plastic but seems durable enough
A small red LED lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet regardless of whether youre charging your phone or not
I debated giving this four or five stars and decided to gives it five based on the great price
I purchase this phone for both my wife and I and we both love them
Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time to learn to navigate but is very versatile and functional
Reception and call quality are great and pairing with a bluetooth headset was quick and painless
There is no 3g in my area but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing
This phone comes with both a standard and extended battery
With pretty heavy usage I still have 12 battery power at night
Lots and lots of 3rd party software available to make this phone done pretty much whatever you want
Ive been using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it
Sure there are things I would change but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes
The keyboard buttons are really small but then Im not sure how you could fitting all of them on the phone if they were bigger
If you ever saw an ad that has a number like this 1800BigDeal good luck on figuring out the alphatonumeric translation
I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr and really miss this feature
The list would be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone
Browser support is awesome I can views everything even Flash apps
Glass screen doesnt scratch and screen resolution is unbelievable
Quick toggle scroll button on side is a life saver
No having to slides the battery off to remove or replaces
I hear the iPhone is supposed to were the real deal but until I see for myself Im sticking with this beauty
Free Cant go wrong which ever way you look at it
It is the best windows mobile phone currently available in my oppinion
There is no LCD light to told you its charging status instead the screen has to were on all the time
There is no way to knows when the num lock key is on so you just have to presses a number key and see what comes up
In order to unlocks the phone you have to press the onoff button at the top of the phone which is not in a very convenient location
this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality
Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery
Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keeping the life of the battery longer
Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome
When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature then it was optional then it was gone
Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player
Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating
Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play
Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11
Sorry Win2k users forget NT or Win9X or Me video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP
Get a MicroSD card and putting your music on that card and you can play it from there
Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory
Since this is a MS Smartphone there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone
Be aware of the aspect ratio this is a landscape display and not portray
If you get games or applications for it be sure of the aspect ratio
Size your pictures to the display and you will are happy with the clarity and sharpness
The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing
Camera is slow and not very clear but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either
The ones that come with this phone are lame at best
The ones that come with it are OK but taking some navigation to gotten around
Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service but that is not the phones fault so maybe I should not listing this complaint
Product is ok dont think itd protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up
But it is aesthetically appealing will protect from small scuffs and scrathes
It is unbelievably inexpensive for how well it works
I was concerned with the 1 star review so I ordered from desirepro who had a higher rating instead of Eforcity
It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pocket
This case is about 12 inch wider and thicker but it protects the phone on all sides except the top
It looks great and the magnet puts it to sleep which is nice
Even though it is a bit more bulky I cant went back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks
I just use a screen protector but many use Best Skins Ever with it no problem
You can pretty much do anything you would liking with this product The only draw back that i could find is that it doesnt charge while you have it plugged in
Other then that you can manager anything you would liking
after talking to cingular i found out that i would has to spends 40 to gotten a cable to connects my samsung d807 to my laptop
and i can manage anything on my phone that i wan
Had heard other replacement styluses didnt quit fit properly
These replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus
Works just fine Delivery was earlier than predicted
I looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a simple thing but they didnt have them
I ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right to my doorno muss no fuss
This is the way to buy such items Thanks for a great job
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to weren't
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt am not happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to pressurize
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does don't what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
This was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to removed these somehow
Compared to the face out belt clip I had previously this face in version has proved to be a bit more stable and sturdy so far
Make sure you put the phone in with the camera facing the clip
This is a great holster really cheap price I ordered a couple this time because its only fault is that it will broke pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hitting it on the arm of a chair but for the money its great
It is heavy duty rubber that is thin where it can weren't and thicker in all the necessary places
It has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the Sansa screen from scratching or shattering
Youd weren't silly not to purchasing this 20 case to protecting your 150 investment
The one downside I can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allow the player to sit in most cradles docks or speakers
It is not difficult to puts the case on but it would was frustrating to takes it on and off often
Just something to considering if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often
The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the toughskin on
I gave this four stars because the jacket adds significant bulk and weight to the Sansa product
What was once a slim sleek product is now a rather large rubberized item
On the plus side this jacket definitely protects the MP3 it is very solid and covers the item completely and securely
They included a belt clip and a screen cover that is very hard and will not was easily scratched
The buttons around the wheel are far easier to pressure now
I wish there were other color choices but over all Im very pleased with the product
Before it was covered I was reluctant to puts in my purse or pocket for fear of breakage and scratches to the screen but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go
The Sansa e200 is good for all of the things it will done considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the Ipod Nano
Unlike the Nano it will played video and comes with its own video conversion software
Further unlike the Nano the Sansa has a built in FM tuner and FM recorder which can be nice
Finally the sansa has a voice recorder which I do not have a personal use for but just goes to shows how feature rich this mp3 player is
The Sansa which will accept upto a 2gig MicroSD memory card but turns on slowly when a memory card is placed in the expansion slot
I like to listened to audio books and the Sansa does not hasn't the ability to bookmark
This makes listening to audio books very difficult
Overall the Sansa is a very feature rich player with a great battery life with only a few shortcomings
Im always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well
I dont have to worry about the screen getting scratched The screen on the Sansa e2oo series scratches very easily with the hard plastic screen protector
I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and coworkers
While I thankfully havent had to tests the protective qualities of this product it appears it will do the job nicely
The only thing I would changed is to gave it a fixed belt clip
Great case protects my Sansa well even makes the buttons easier to pushes
Decent Sansa products are hard to find thank you Speck
great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user
Always at Starbucks or Libraries studying and this added safety is necessary to protecting the player
It is very well made and seems like it will done an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall
The funny thing is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it
Before I bought the ToughSkin the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped
Now that it is in the case it is very easy to holding and grip with very little pressure
It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it
The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well
The only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratching more easily than I would expects
Overall this is an excellent product that I would not hesitated to recommend
This cover is the best you can got for your Sansa E series player
It increases the size a little but the durability is worth it
The belt clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too
It also comes with a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary item my display began to showed minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use so if you dont buys this at least get the little expensive stick on covers
The toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier
The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the microsd slot without removing the Sansa but that is only a small issue
My advice you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 player so spends a little more and protects it the best you can
Im a previous owner of Body Glove Cel Phone cases a Moto V810
I purchased this item from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255
The case protects every part of my Cel buttons screens jacks and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case and looks nice
I got this caseholster a while back after another makers fell apart in a short time
What I would add is that the case is durable and I am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months
The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snapped together so they stay in place on the phone so it cant easily fall out a problem that Id had with a different product
The part that slips over the top of the phone has a builtin seethrough window that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case
The quality of construction looks to am pretty good too
I was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone
I wanted a holster that wasnt a sloppy generic model that didnt fit
I was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and I tried it on my Motorola V180
So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you that you wont be disappointed
The added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer
This is a great case I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didnt line up
Because this is a flip phone most cases move when you open and shut the phone covering speakers etc
This case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement when you open and close the phone doesnt affect the placement of the holes etc
Also the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent
After reading the reviews here of this case I thought Id take the plunge and trying it
The cases Id seen in stores were fairly cheesey although they were cheaper
The materials are firstrate and the fit is perfect
From longviewers advice I got this case and he was right on Awesome custom fit Great case for the money THANK YOU Gar
This is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free Motorola V180 Spend the money on this case to protect your phone I looked at many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly really PROTECTIVE
The V180 apparently has had a few comments on the home screen going kaplooky nuf said I needed a better grade clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad
Sydney Harbour gets high marks on this feature not flimsy dull plastic but very clear quality stuff
Secondly the supersoft matte black leather is a sweet fit nice and snug formfitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching
The cut outs are perfectly lined up too there IS one for the speaker phone feature on the back not mentioned in the ads
Snap on the antenna loop and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel
Sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product but if youre like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life you try to made smart and carefully considered purchases
Be nice to yourself and your phone Go with Sydney Harbour and avoids the cheaper stuff
The cords retract when you want to folded it up so very convenient
It does not come with a case so youll use your own bag or whatever
The only thing I can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged
Retractables just take up less space among all the head phone wires chargers and you name it junk in our console between the van seats
Functions the same as more expensive chargers sold in Cellphone stores
The included software for the USB cable does not have software or drivers for the enV VX9900
Price is right for the car charger though so I am not mad
I like the texture of the skin feels like rubber
Charges phone and second battery at the same time
It is nice to have it on the desk and I can use the speaker phone on my desk
Velcro is velcro its solid but the separation noise can was annoying when youre trying to gotten to your phone in a quiet setting
Love the flexability of the side connectors allowing quick access to the phone
Shipper delivered this product in a timely manner and the product is of great quality
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look
Though it makes the phone a little more bulky than you might been used to at first it quickly becomes a nonfactor and though it doesnt provide quite as much extra life as I had hoped it would it does in fact make the difference between my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry
This car charger for the Blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores at a fraction of the price
I also use it to charge my Motorola Bluetooth headset that has the same USB mini jack
These cases were not available when the Pearl hit the market we were able to gets them from this merchant
I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake
Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potential to last a long time something that prior holsters have failed to didn't
I also like the magnetic closure which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case without the need for finding a snap fitting
My older Blackberries have had cases which after use had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the twohanded method for nesting my phone one hand to motion the flap out of the way and the other to inserted the phone into the case
This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the morepreferred onehanded approach
Although still relatively new my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction
Before I purchased my Leather Swivel case I looked at 3rd party generic cases
Each of these were unable to notify my Blackberry that it was in its holster
With my new swivel case as soon as I insert my Pearl the display shuts off thereby extending battery life
In addition this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or not
Also since this is an OEM case it was made especially for my Pearl
When holsetered both the USB connectorthe earphone outlets and the volume control buttons are all accessible
With nonOEM cases in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone I might have to removed the phone from its case
I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no case at all
This is probably due to its small size and your ability to just slipping the phone into your shirt pocket unlike prior Blackberry devices
Of course that still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratchpotential
They should have at least provided a simple pouch which would provide some protection
This of course is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel case which is the subject of THIS review
Allinall I highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on your belt
You need to hunt down all the drivers and software for it on your own if you want it to work well with the e815
but that was long enough for me to didn't a seem edit and so now Ill use bluetoothobex to sync and transferred
The charger also connecteddisconnected constantly
making my phone beep every 10 seconds as it started to chargenot charge repeatedly
If you plan to use it for this purpose I recommend hunting down Moto phone tools 3
11 SDmodified p2k seem and the e815 usb drivers usbmot2000
Besides all the functions described above the cable has one more functionit can isn't used as a charger tooThis is really cool
For every order I put I received the products within 34 days at the price of ground shipping fees
This battery has much better life than the battery that come with the Q
I would say you can done twice as much talking surfing texting etc
There are higher Mah batteries available for the Q but they cost 4959 so for 13 or so this is a pretty good deal
The only downside and maybe I just didnt read description well enough is that the battery door is silver which looks dorky on my black Q
Though still not quite enough battery for the juicesucking Q it is worlds better than the included battery
I would loving to seen a clip on the back to attaches the original battery as well to swapped when the extended one dies
The battery Was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly
The Battery Makes the Phone Last 2 days even with continued use
Great buying if you use your Q like I do I watch movies play NES games listen to music oh yeah make call sending text messages etc
If you are like me and drop your phone constantly then this is a great product for you
I really like this case It is easy to puts on and taken off
It does not having that stupid plastic cover over the screen
It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold
I would really like for something to glow in the dark so that I could finds it easier in the black hole that is my purse
Hey what kind of phone is that Im getting the red one too and the pink one for my sweetie
I have tried 45 of theses phones over the last 4 years
The latest was the Cingular 8525 HTC makes it and it dropped 80 of incoming calls on pickup and 20 of outgoing calls
I thinks Windows was loading a DLL lt The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based SPs
I wasnt 100 sure Id want the 680 when it was first announced but a big nasty scratch on my 650s screen helped me decide to take the plunge
The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better the internal slot for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might gotten lost and the covered SD card slot is very welcome because the darned thing always popped out in my 650
The only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button
To resets the 680 you have to take out the battery
Thats not a big deal since even on the 650 you have to removed the battery cover to get to the reset switch
Whats better on the 650 The main thing for me is that the cell phones radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards SDHC
I use this phone for everything since its also a great Palm organizer
In addition to that Ive installed a registered version of Pocket Tunes so its a very good MP3 player
Its even compatible with PlaysForSure if youre into that
I also use the phone to play games like Monopoly and Scrabble when Im waiting on line or in a boring meeting
I have absolutely zero complaints about this phone
Believe it or not i consider going from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrade
i guess the whole battery problem depends on the usage and the person
My battery problem is that i cant kill the darn thing
I am one of those people that depletes a battery completely before recharging it
I do it to my laptop and my iPod and the PDA i had before the BlackJack the Tungsten 2E
Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks
Mainly because you CAN NOT creates and edit word excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook
Even the contacts wouldnt backup Needless to said the Treo 680 saved me
If you do going the way of the blackjack without Outlook look into SBSHs programs Facade and Papyrus
However if you go with the lovely Treo check out DialByPhoto i think the coolest part is how you can set up a Favorite 5 like TMobile offers but still have all the reliability of Cingular
I just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it
Some people ask me What can that thing do and i respond to that what cant it do
I can goes on microsoft word and do what i need to do
The last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should getting it when it is cheap if you have the chance
The Pros PDA good mobile phone that really gets out a camera for all those Kodak Moments all packed in one for a good price
The Cons Youll need to get a replacement longer life battery Seidio makes one and the browser Blazer has MANY problems
Im very happy with the purchase of this smartphone
Ive wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justifying spending big bucks for one
You can works around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software its a nice little phone
I havent bought a memory card for it so I cant report on the mp3 capabilities but I am going in that direction
Somehow I dont think it will replace my iPod but you never know
Ive had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications I especially love having the Goodlink email application my family videos mp3s pics and all my office documents at a touch of a finger
Yes the battery life goes quickly but I dont mind charging my treo every night
The slick and slim design is a real eye catcher and feels great in the hand
in the one month of usage my Treo has hung one time a simple reset fixed it and hasnt hung since
I bought this even though I saw a lot of negative reviews some about battery life some about dropped signals
I have owned many Palm devices over the years and I will be the first one to say that Palm can make lemons and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later if they ever do
Not the most customeroriented qualityoriented company out there
But their OS is still the easiest to use in my mind and with the myriad of apps out there you can making it do whatever you want pretty much
The screen is on the smallish side compared to the TX but its not that bad especially for a phone
Its pretty reliable and I have put a lot of my old software on it
The battery is what surprised me the most I was expecting something really bad but so far I have never been under 50 and I am a heavy Palm user
I dont use the phone part of it much just a call here and there and I turn the phone function off at night
I also bought KBLightsOff which turns off the keyboard lights unless you are using it which probably helps a lot
So with these two settings battery life is close to the TX in my opinion
I have one dead pixel but that can happened to any electronics manufacturer
5mm jack at the bottom of the device thats a terrible place to put it
But with an adapter I can use my good headphones and sound is good
Get pTunes Deluxe so you can use subsription music like Napster or Yahoo Music
I should receive my 8GB SDHC card tomorrow which will turns my Treo into an iPhone killer IMHO
Sound level is OK and you can get software that boosts it up if youre deaf
Speaker level is LOUD The SMS program is great the phone app is great and fast
I wish Palm wouldnt charge an arm and a leg for accessories but you dont have to buy from them
Overall I am very happy with this product it protects the phone without taking away from its beauty nor does it made the phone bulkier
My only compliants are that it does not come with a screen cover and it makes the phone slightly harder to slid open
I think this would work better with a money type clip
However since Verizon doesnt carry anything like this in clear this works
My chocolate phone is obviously valuable to me so I want to kept it in tip top condition this skin is incredibely sexy and allows me to use my phone with ease
Promptly received two replacement batteries for our phones for the price of one from the original vendor
They work great They hold a charge with normal use for about twothree days as did our original ones when we first purchased them
Bought this to replace my threeyearold cell phone and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc
Ive had a couple of questions that I asked Cingular only to be forwarded to Palm only to be forwarded to Microsoft then back to Cingular
It seems no Customer Service department has really mastered this unit
The unit turns off the sound by itself and the only way Ive found to fix it is to do a soft reset
Im not crazy about Microsoft Outlooks calendar compared to Palms
I miss several Palm features like the Go to and the Today buttons
Outlooks calendar just isnt as easy to manuever as Palms
Phone listening volume is low especially when the unit is in a protective case which puts it a little further from your ear
Love being able to pressurize a picture to makes a call
We have five kids I have each kids picture linked to their phone number
Even my technologychallenged husband can call them by simply pressing their picture
This phone talks A female voice announces who is calling and when your next appointment is
The first time she spoke it about scared me to death
The voice reminds me of the computer on Star Trekbut not as clear
However after getting used to her accent she is intelligible which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken wordsamazing
I dont need email on the run and I could live without this and the extra monthly cost
Most traditional Internet web sites take much too long to load and display too small a portion of the page to be useful
It is nice to checker the weather or got directions on the go
Cant imagine watching a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen
Splurged on a sweet little Vaja leather case that is wonderful
Amazons prices were the best BY FAR on this product Saved over 300 off my local retail Cingular dealer
Best part I no longer have to carries a PDA and a cell phone They are one and the same
Conclusion this phone is very smart and fun to use although it comes with a big learning curve
The low volume issue could were a problem for someone with bad hearing
The whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with Cingular Wireless Customer Service to port over my number from Verizon
The Treo 750 was a snap to figure out setting up my email took only a few minutes
Ive owned it for three weeks now and I am still discovering great phonePDA features
I bought a 4gb mini SD card samsung memory from ebay for 39
Combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs
Theyre about the best sounding earbuds you can got with a 2
Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750 but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it wont arrive for about a month and a half I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately
Because of Windows OS it is very easy to use and understand functions
I ordered this phone on Sunday evening and got it on Wednesday Amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones
Also I ordered two phones Family plan there was some problem in other phone I requested the replacement and Amazon FIRST sent me the replacement of that phone through FREE 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to returned problem phone
I work for an University and my contract was due 2 months ago
I decided to getting this phone because my PDA was already old and I needed something that would be efficient
I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good things to say about it
First it is not as heavy as the last model 650 and also looks really cool
Second the interface is pretty easy to use and figure it out
The phone is Microsoft OS based I used a palm device before so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue
The battery works really well and in spite of other reviews the life have been pretty great even when compared with my last phone a motorola
In general I thinks is a pretty good buy and you can not beat the price when Cingular sells it for way more money than Amazon
Ill definetively will buy from this website again
I got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported like short time lived batery
The only problem I am facing is with setting my voice mail
The icon shown in the today page does not accept any number I will to attach to it
As a result I was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number
I really hope this is a problem to were fixed soon by Palm with a downloadable file because except for this problem Treo 750 is really great
Fits my Treo 680 even in the case which is a big plus
hiim a satisfied costumer for the motorola i760 phone
Before all i had was a phone boothbut now that i got this phone no booth for me and evryone is sayen they want one too so im helpen
my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones ive ever heard
i dont know what its called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it
the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time including him
its great for a business that has many locations
i only given this product four stars because i havent tried it myself so i dont know all the features
I came over from Cingular after trying there PTT just not happening for me and I will leave it at that
I choose this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall Love Blue I bought this for 110
00 at a corporate store I get a discount for the company I work for
We had a problem with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the box phone
The clarity and ease of functionality is Fantastic you dont have to am not a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the GPS along with Telenav is fantastic we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower I can still connects to one another like normal walkie talkies hey if your going to spend the money do it right the first time
I put the extended battery on mine and I get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge which too me is great
Dont change the default times for backlighting thats whats eating the battery time up also dont leave a java application in suspension that will ate the battery up also
Buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds Moto has a phonebook manager package on there site which is FREE and is SO easy to use
For Ringtones and wallpapers u can use WebJal once again EASY to use
I looked at other phones and I DONT NEED CAMERAS in a phone the primary selling feature was the fact of large numbers and ease of use
My husband and I just recently upgraded to this phone
We were going to got to the i560 but got a great deal on these
the other always came unclipped when I stood up falling to the ground
The front screen for caller ID seems a little dark and the area to charged it is a little harder to get tothat plastic still gets in the way Those are the only negatives so far
Since my husband is switching from an old i90 he loves it Hope this helps with purchasing
Also if you have no service you can use these as walkie talkies
I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving so I decided to upgrades my phones
the first 730s speaker grill came off and i tried to glues it back on myself
So I went to Nextel to gotten my new i760 after researching it on the internet
I didnt need a camera phone since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures
One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April I couldnt sign back up for two years and get the 150
I could only sign up for a year and I had to pay 275
super short battery life especially if you have the web
instead of having a separate button for each number key it has three big keys with little squares to make it looked like there are separate keys
unfortunately you have to am not careful and hit the button fairly close to center otherwise youll dial the number above or beneath it
the jury is still out on this one but ill list it under cons
the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal
it also shows the photo when you call that person
if you dont use the phone for a couple of minutes the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to doesn't is pushes a button to wakes it up
The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front especially since there were several colors
This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blue
I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo its well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable
The material is soft to the touch but strong on protection
I dont like the lanyard they send with the product its about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces
I prefer a smaller more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist
I tripped and basically THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk
This is the second skin Ive owned the first from JAVOSkin and I like this one better than the first
The skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use
I didnt like the cord attaching bump on the side at first but I did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to finds in my handbag
I highly recommend this product whether or not you use the cord
I love the fact that I can now drops without it ending up in 3 pieces on the floor The only thing I dont like is that its not exactly grey but not quite clear
but who cares its a great product for a great price
Idropped my new phone at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere in 3 places
This item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesnt easily clip into the phone you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it
This holster provides good protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt
The flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to removing the device
This is perfect for someone who is prone to knocks things around that are on their belt
My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks
I would given it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls
I have bought and returned three of these units now
Each one has been defective and finally I just gave up on returning the system
The DVD player constantly gives Bad Disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc
The sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player doesnt work its essentially useless
I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups and the last 5 or so failed
I thought it was my software so I got new software
Guess what My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed too
Its not my burner as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learning to read as its brand new and doesnt require the firmware upgrade they mention
So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best
Im buying some now and saved myself the frustration
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever the case I wont buy them ever again
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality
The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one
Im using the Plextor DVD burner love it but Im going to trying my luck with a different DVD brand
Its less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters
Please dont expect to gotten the cash back from this purchase as promised To date Ive been denied twice
The second time they said the U P C number was invalid
Only its the original U P C barcode I was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state All required products were not submitted
Meanwhile I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodging a formal complaint
That said its definitely not worth the full asking price
Well the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it
I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand while being the original is pricey
Low cost alternatives are needed but not at the expense of quality and TCO total cost of ownership
But the flap about poor customer service rebates and poor quality zippers and sleeve binding is enough to gave me pause
So if someone from Xtremes management is paying attention
Price isnt everything to everyone in the markt for your product
I use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq
It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
After that everytime I on the camera it wanted me to reformat the cardWTH is that
Im always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon
One mistake I madeI threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card thought It worked and It would be OK
Needless to sayIm too over confident with LEXARs products
As the other reviewer found out these cards cant am not formatted to work with SD Audio
did not fly either my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS
I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it
Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product
They need to checkered out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones
My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money
ADS also told me it would not work with Uleads Movie Factory 3 some of the software it came bundled with but that was Uleads problem
I should use Cap Wiz Their program DUH Guess what it did not work with their program either
Ulead said they had several complaints with ADSs product
Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will haven't a new version of cap wiz and that might working
Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product P
Since ADS doesnt consider the product defective they will not refunded your money or allows you trade it in for an upgrade
I dont think they want a product like that either
When I purchased these batteries I was very pleased but that wore off after a couple of months
I dont use my camera all that often but when I do I expect ther batteries to have some charge
I recharge them per instructions and they do not holds a charge any longer
I know Monster makes good products but I am a little disappointed in this one
You can got a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9
Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks
If you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page
We bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not finding it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks
how bizarre They do not carries battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to have battery back up it might deserves a chance however whats the use in having an alarm clock if you cant trust that it will indeed wake you up
CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 monthsnow nap function and radio are all that worksif only I could finding the damn receipt
In the ten minutes since Ive had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off
More importantly It cant handle large manuals as advertised
The reason I purchased this particular book holder My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only wanting to reads the middle chapter
Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to goes through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages
If you dont anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on kept an eye on the page retainers these are the parts that fell off and you should was ok
As for me Im off to reads Amazons return policy and seen if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
This is the worst thing I have ever owned It broke said there were no cds inside after about a week Do yourself a favor dont get this product dont bought this brand and dont buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader
I tried hard trying not to break the card no success
May am because my card was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem
Any way I had to send it back and buying 12in1 SanDisk Reader
Cons famous poppingcrackling noises makes it useless for gaming especially in BF2 which use OpenAL by Creative
This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20 of high end systems not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards see Google for XFi poppingcrackling
Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change
For long time Creative denied existence of this problem
Eventually it was recognized see official CL forums and a new driver since November 2005 was promised at the end of May 2006 but beta version published 053006 did not solvated my problem
In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial hacked drivers
I suspect that XFi crackling is an architecture design flow which can not be completely solved at software level because PCI bus can not provisioning sufficient memory access for the the fastest sound processor simultaneously with high end graphic card HD controller and other devices
Bottom end I have to stopper playing games or goes back to low quality integrated sound
Do not take risk wait for working drivers or buys a working card from different manufacturer
With fixed drivers I would gives this card 4 or 5 stars
I found that many desktop motherboards MB have really slow south bridge south bridge is connecting PCI USB Firewire and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge especially MBs with NVidia chipsets and even with some Intel MBs
New beta XFi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4GSATA2 nVidia 6100 410 MCP chipset but situation is still marginal and XFi might go unstable again
I contact CL customer service they did not solved the problem but pointed out that ATI chipsets Athlon 64 ATI 200 or 3200 have no problems with XFi
I decided not to returned SB to selling but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB
I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCIX even NVidia based also should am fine with XFi
The trouble is that majority of XFi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me
So I can gives XFi two stars instead of 1 but I can not changing the rating and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release if it will worked
About three years ago maybe four I bought two Lexar CFII cards
One never worked the other worked but lost all data
I wrote to Lexar that I had two bad cards they sent me one new card of the same size
I gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she didnt care about losing
None of the file removal programs will gotten the images off Ive used all of them had their file removal tech help give up
In this day age of just making the item I am upset
Do you wanted the only picture of your great grandmother lost because you used a Lexar I wouldnt I use an actual sandisk card myself
If they ever Lexar made it right I may had written a better review but they havent
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself is not very accurate
Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplished much
Real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
The card worked fine for my sons graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brothers wedding and I lost all the photos from that event
If you have an iPod or other remember to backup your photos as soon as you can to trying and avoid this
Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD
After the repair process the entire disk was unplayable
With billions of CDs in the world is this the best that the 21st century has to offer
This SD would not worked in my Nikon Coolpix S6 camera but the Fuji and Sandisk product did
I bought this card for my TJ25 supposedly a supported device
But the problems with this card make it nearly useless
Even if the browser DID working it would only working for 30 days before you had to buy the full version
The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora which doesnt do anything except display text you cant even filling in web forms with it so webmail searches etc
The card is designed to working with NetFront and CLIE Mail software that comes with Internetenabled CLIE devices
obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card
The card wouldnt connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either no additional configuration required
While attempting to connects the card would often stop responding and then lock up the handheld
Bottom line if you want a webenabled PDA buy a webenabled PDA
ive given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD the sound from my system did seem to was a little better the CDs were not skipping as much
but the bottom line is it didnt fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before
not sure if this has anything to didn't with the fact that my set has a 6disk CD changer
I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2
I like it but the flash card doesnt slide in easily
Sometimes it gotten stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins
To add insult to injured both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk
Therefore they SHOULD works seamlessly together but pathetically they dont
Id much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you working every time you use the thing
For comparison my camera accepts the card perfectly
There is no give at all but instead is an effortless process
Surprisingly the reader doesnt topple over as easily as I thought it would
It stands vertically and looks like it might fallen over when trying to slide the card in
Sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in
Eject the card from the PCs drive and then remove it
Overall Im glad to hadn't it but its an annoyance to use it
I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
I wouldnt waste my money on any more of these POS discs
I wish I could returned them to amazon but for what I paid it was pretty cheap its not worth the effort
2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008
Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service
00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty and can not guarantee a fix
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switching frequency
You may have to experiments a good deal to finding a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas
Even then if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage its going to be hard to finds a frequency where this will work
Mostly you cant use this with a cover on and youll need a car charger if you want to use it for long
The allinone modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution
I had two of them and they both broke within the first month
The company does haven't a 3 month warranty but you have to pays for shipping to sending it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement
It is incredibly slow by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that Ive used
It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files
I attempted to copies 50MB 1500 files 800 directories to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy Thats roughly 27Ksecond
Deleting the files was painful as well taking at least 15 minutes to deletes everything
For kicks I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copies the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds
Bottom line is dont be fooled by the drives small physical size large capacity and price point it simply doesnt perform
I wanted to replaced a Lexar 1GB with this but Ill keep looking
I used it to transfer a 700MB 2300 file My Documents folder to a new PC
The transfer seemed pretty slow but deleting those files from the Sandisk took 61 minutes Back it goes
Product MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
11132006 0751 am When will I gotten my repaired or replaced item
You have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status
Please respond by the way Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
1113 Still waiting for an update on the M240 you received on 113
I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hooked up my mp3 player to it
The first unit I received would not turns on at all
I contacted Philips tech support and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense
Fortunately Amazon has a very nice return policy and I sent it back to them instead
Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit
The replacement stereo arrived in short order and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality which didnt seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing
After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMTNE3 bookshelf stereo that I own here are my thoughts
Both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length
The Philips stereo however would hisses and crackling as I moved around the room my body interfered with the reception
Playing the same song sidebyside on the two stereos I found that the Philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the CMTNE3
The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality
Also there seemed to weren't significant distortion in the highfrequencies on the Philips stereo making S sounds sound more like H sounds
I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input
The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good
For one thing the stereo will easily tips over forwards if accidentally bumped
If that happens the CD can got wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to removed
The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the toploading CMTNE3
The volume goes up to 31 or so but 5 is about as loud as you would needn't it for regular listening
This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels which is rather limiting
Finally the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting though I could hadn't looked more closely at the specs when buying it
I am in the process of returning this stereo and I will tried to finding a Sony system instead
Unfortunately Amazon no longer sells the CMTNE3 which I bought just about a year ago
I dont understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churning their product lines so rapidly
Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs
I have to rate this product and this company as horrible
Less than 300 hours on it I called the company
It just blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should be
Additionally the fan diedwhich may were why the lamp blew
Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldnt look at it No
The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place
The company keeps sayingIt is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
They will not accepts that perhaps this was a defective product
I will gets a new projectorI can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fixes my current one
My new projector WILL NOTWILL NEVER wasn't an Infocus product
Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
I emailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not had my projector
my projector stopped working I have given up on it being repaired it was under warranty and am now
struggling to get it back so that I can repairs it out of my own pocket
the Better Business Bureau it is deemed to am unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers Ive found that they run out of juice incredibly fast
Im amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AAs ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AAs lasted only a week
Be warned that these arent quite the bargain they may initially seem
The worst customer service I have ever experienced
The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expected Viking cheats
This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned
After one year is when all of the problems started
The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesnt want to connected at all
I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesnt seem to help
It is very tempremental and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement
So a word to the wise in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just been prepared to replaced it in a year or so
It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer
0 but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
The Xpress functions dont work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time
Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons instead of being able to memorizes their locations with your fingers
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can felt how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the discs about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best
I dont know that to being true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use
I have to buys another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included
If your going to selling something false advertisement is not the way
You will was surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same
This is my main problem the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there
1 The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built
They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about
They are fairly light weight meaning very small magnets in them
These are 3 way speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to wasn't 2 way
2 The sound input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT
3 Its advertised as 320 watts which is meaningless since the speakers suck
What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers
And in case you know some audio 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts log relationship
For some reason this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver
4 No user adjustable equalizer only presets possible
5 Can not connecting a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping type of connections
6 The receiver sucks even my Sandisk flash player seems to had a better receiver
I concur with the other reviewer Death to Sony Shame on them for taking consumers for a ride
This company nowadays makes it stuffing for ultra cheap and prices it Competively with the others meaning fat profit margins
Im so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases
They were great a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center
Somebody could have sat on it and it wouldve been fine
I mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card
For your psp if the game is really important to you and you cant saves it
Just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will went off
it will go on hold and next time you wan na play it again
and hopefully if you did it right youll have the game right back in the place you left it
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustration and wasted time will occurring until you somehow finds out that the user ID should be left blank to log in
The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network
Once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs but I dont accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convincing me it is OK for an OS to hang
I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering it down and backed up it never did work again If you buy one go through the setup and if it doesnt work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON Dont waste your precious time trying to get a 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time
Finally Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keeping the potential customer from being discouraged
However YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES
If the product is in fact good it wont have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional
However looking up all the bad reviews for this product
They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tankswhich is why I bought the thing but now the print head isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there
The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canon website they dont even acknowledge this printer ever existed
Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree
Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not been seen with this printer
I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon
five star ratings are from people that JUST bought this MP3
I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time
Whith in 3 weeks my sons was no longer working at all he had it in his back pack and some how it got crunched enough to never work again I was not happy
Also in a few months mine started to haven't issues
And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony
I accually removed the cover to the toggle and just moved the joy stick under it to change songs or volume
I have done a lot of research this time and I will not buy another Sony
The hold button that is part of this sliding door never works I find the player dead in my gym bag all the time Apparently the door slides over a bit and the player will turns on FOR HOURS and than you have a dead player
Maybe Sony should have given us a onoff button than this would not happen Dont do it folks look into other options even my moms iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player
First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony but I have to
advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman
I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006 as I had purchased replacement
insurance and was able to return it because it broke
It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphones
The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesnt allow for more photos after only using 40mb
I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP
Bad investment Would not recommended the product unless there is a way I can got a refund or an exchange
I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
getting about 50 rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasion
multiple CD RWs with critical material would NOT reading on multiple computers
You have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would falls apart
I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem
In October 2004 I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon
After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed I immediately found a few images corrupted
formatted the CF before use there were alway corrupted images
I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer
I have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer Imac w Intel chiphardly outdated simply doesnt recognize themlike I never put in a disc at all
The kicker is that this spring I also ordered two spindles of these discs exactly the same as far as I can tell from which I burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one for a freind overseas
I have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs
The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not sent in MailinRebate
Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode
How can I resubmited when they already have the barcode
In my experience with SanDisk I got rebating back on one of two cards that I submitted so you get mailin rebate 50 of the time with SanDisk
I think mailinrebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made
It felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic
Not just the construction but the performance was terrible
It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes
Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one but I wouldnt took that chance again
I wish I could give this device a worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x
Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner
So if you are looking for 16x do not buys this one
Its been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was shipped from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order
When I contacted EMARTCRAP all they could tell me was that it had been shipped
I just hope that I will receiving it before it becomes obsolete
Your are better off paying a higher price for better service
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can said about this unit
The included software is a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplugged and pluged the unit back in to get it to responded again
This unit would were great if it came out 7 years ago
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the discs about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cdsdvds
I cant given a complete review of the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvd
How do I assigns a rating As several other people have experienced my unit is also DOA
I received it plugged it in pressed clean and the motor started up
I popped open the cover put in the disc I wanted cleaned and pressed clean again
Whats worse is the unit case is glued together no way to opens it up to tries to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer
I though this would saves me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to making much difference with any of my discs
I dont thinks this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestion would wasn't to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
I purchased this flash card in June for my GPS memory
Card lost all its memory and was unable to taking a new load
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter
I bought a Vector brand inverter at WalMart and it is much better
This item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car
Eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets
The product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car
The mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it
I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail
I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my money is refunded
About a year ago I got one of these to allowed me to playing DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling
It has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately
I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs
Now that Im taking another trip I thought Id try it out in other cars
The thing is dead doesnt do a thing when I plug it in
Each time you replaced the battery you have to reload all of your data
When this adapter first arrived I thought it was great
The sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitterstyle adapter there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area
The first day I used it for about 20 minutes total didnt have far to drive and it worked great
I didnt expect it to last forever but less than an hour
Yes it has a 1 year warranty just send the unit back with a money order 6 to cover the return postage
Of course then youre spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit
I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it
I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not works so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try
I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me BUT after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where I couldnt listen anymore with it
My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable
No kidding The shipping charge on these batteries was over 6
Amazon doesnt itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you wont knowing that youre being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
The Delorme software itself is not very accurate
Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to finding it
I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplished much
Real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
These Xtreme cd cases STINKsliterally I dont know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic but the smell is absolutely nauseous
I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away
In theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these 2 for me 1 for a friend I cant say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible to closured the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness
Ive only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row
Ive spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks
After MONTHS of emails and phone calls customer service responded
What a joke They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in
Gim me a break I shouldnt have to didn't the Hokie Pokie just to got it to work
I was impressed with this controller at first and found it to feel comfortable and work well
It was played with once and a while for about a month total 10 hours max
Some time after that the next time I went to use it it would only gone left in a game that used the left joystick
I could not get it to center or even stayed still it would just keeps either steering the car like Burnout3 or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what
I tried it several times and it has never worked since
I fire it up once and a while to seen if its still doing it and it does
I am very dissapointed in this and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller
I think I paid about 45 locally for it and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for 19
99 that works and feels as good but is less than half the cost
I dont really feel like going thru a warranty claim if its even covered but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox drawer of extra stuff
I was going to going totally wireless 4 units and luckily didnt run out and bought 3 more of these Logitech controllers
I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there
If the Pelican holds up model PL2050 version 2
0 I might go get some more if I can finds them locally
I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it
I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two in that time you love it
but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with
The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment
Im just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isnt on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade
Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver
After the contoller started breaking down i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air
I bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when its on my lap sitting in a chair
Im very satisfied with its being able to accomplish that
HOWEVER the cord ended up breaking after a few months
Targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle
Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on
After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first
The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years
It lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to done anything with my xd card
It worked just fine for 34 days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable
The DVDs are a ripoff although Im counting on the REBATE to at least broke even not counting my time
Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue
Just a poor product Velocity ought to be ashamed
Id recommend Verbatims DVDR DL product made in Singapore
As a note I can gotten other DVDRs to worked just fine
I havent submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesnt work
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick
But I could not inserted My GIG card into this reader
I tried hard trying not to break the card no success
May be because my card was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
I contacted Lexar but did not got any explanation of this problem
Any way I had to sends it back and bought 12in1 SanDisk Reader
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to loads music to make it not even play
I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America Minneapolis MN and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it
Gee thanks Ill be looking at another brand Apple stinks
Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would aren't a reasonable price
But for Alkaline This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell
You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
As you can see from the other reviews the speed on this thing is pathetic almost to the point of nonfunctional when it comes to many small files
I had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folder
makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to tested this thing
512MB Mini 256MB Mini before I bought this product
Performance wise this particular product is not doing good
Its taking long time to copies files from my computers
Even its taking long time to delete files from this disk
So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk
I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB
Now Im planning to buying 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive
Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product
A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not are finalized for unexplained reasons
Product MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
11132006 0751 am When will I get my repaired or replaced item
You have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status
Please respond by the way Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
1113 Still waiting for an update on the M240 you received on 113
No where near as easy to use as my old system But with trial and error can hadn't a decent amount of control over your Projects
But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier
is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alters
the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disksburner or what
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making
It might are the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing
Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
I connected all the cables as instructed but it doesnt work the light is not on
These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card
There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality
I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration
Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily got the same capacity 12x at 14 the mentioned price
SO why pay more if your camera does not supporting this technology
Its not something you can just threw away if it decides to stop working
Delivery was great only took them a couple of days
The connector to the cpen was for some reason cut in half
Without it you cant recharge or connect the cpen to the pc
I called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours
I dont care if the product itself is greatIll never know now will I
If youre unable to receive support when you need em youre screwed
If youre just interested in electronic equipments just want to tried things out and dont really cares if youre on your own go ahead and tried it
Otherwise bought a product that you can trusting on with respect to aftersales support
I have to rate this product and this company as horrible
Less than 300 hours on it I called the company
It just blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should were
Additionally the fan diedwhich may be why the lamp blew
Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldnt look at it No
The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place
The company keeps sayingIt is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product
I will getting a new projectorI can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fixing my current one
My new projector WILL NOTWILL NEVER are an Infocus product
Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
The worst customer service I have ever experienced
The lady who alledged to are the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expects Viking cheats
This item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera but was never delivered
Now Amazon wants me to review it so here your are
This is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything youd hope for in an iPod dock
The iPod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves
After a little bit of use the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together
If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldnt stress the electronics Id give this thing 5 stars
But without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sounding good
Luckily I didnt pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr
which worked every time and I always end up using it instead
It has more than paid for itself in repaired CDs20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang
The motorized version didnt come with any deep scratch sanding pads which I need about 25 of the time for a badly scratched disc
Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine and wont start turning so I have to squeeze it together to make it working
One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel button and it did not working straight out of the box
Beyond that setting it up takes time but is not difficult
I am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out
I have six devices connected to my HD television set
The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote
I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly
At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turned on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to records to Replay TV which can not turn the TV on and off
I have two NiMH chargers and sony batteries wont charge in them
They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers
They force you to buy their own nonstandard charger that probably wont again charge other brand batteries
Dont waste your money or support Sonys attempt to bring nonstandard products into a standardized market
Soon we have to carrying bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
Once again Im amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product
These are terribly uncomfortable for my ears and dont really provide that great of listening experience
The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds and then they become distractingly uncomfortable
But of course this is just my experience your mileage may vary as they say
Personally I found my Apple iPod phones to am better
My two rear speakers just stopping working and also my
I dont have any other rear speakers to tries on the system
while the verbatim has burned well in 100 of my recordings they fail to operating in at least 24 different dvd players
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feels how warped physically it has become
This is true for all the discs about 150 of them
I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
This media did not working on my brand new asus burner even after updating the firmware
Can capture analog video and producing cdroms but I expected the ability to producing DVD
Instead buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more
Uleads software is stable and its not a trial version
It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture
Pinnacles Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy
I got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term risky cells
It could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but Im
If these were free id still would not recommends them due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings
It is the discs I must assuming since my burner works fine with other brands
Anyway now I think its best to invested a bit more and gets good media
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years
Then I had to purchases two replacements for units that simply quit
Currently only ONE still works I have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years
These units work well to allowance you to saved your work and shutting down
My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD
I cant comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores
There seen to being quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APCs popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand
My experience over the past four years has been mixed
These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes
If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear
I chose to switched to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms
Many users do not haven't that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance
The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years
I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries
Prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor
Battery life depends on many factors so I dont begrudge APC for wear and tears on the battery but to has 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable
I bought APC branded batteries and cant explain why the recurrent failures
Im frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model
Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS
I had this card for more than 6 months and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510
Then all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting card error on my computer and digital camera a week ago
My SDUSB converter couldnt find the card either
I had really good photos I wanted to transferring to my computer and now they are probably lost for good
I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago
What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback
It would isn't nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last
You can not rewindfast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd
sometimes I like to heard a certain portion of a song again but I will have to playing the entire song again
I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I can not done anymore
This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place
The slot on the top that is supposed to allowance you to use the hold feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turning it on and off
The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stays in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod
I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag
I think Ill just gotten it over with and buy one of the more expensive options
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustration and wasted time will occurred until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to logged in
The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network
Once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will working fine for another twelve to 36 hours
I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs but I dont accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convincing me it is OK for an OS to hangs
I ordered the 2year service plan on May 1st this day July 31st I still have not recievied it
I have contacted them a number of times and still nothing
I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork
This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons
This hub will not work with any USB powered devices
So forget being able to charging your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub
Be aware that if you want to connect your printer scanner ipod etc
i purchased the DLO action jacket neoprene for 20 40GB ipods for my wife for use on walks etc around town
The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipods doesnt
The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesnt align either so you cant press the play button
So since the ipod doesnt fit in the case overall this product is useless
pls saving your time and money and considers another ipod case
Not anymore It uses up ink like no other yes it is great to had the individual tankswhich is why I bought the thing but now the print head isnt working right
Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there
The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canon website they dont even acknowledge this printer ever existed
I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive
Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room
The sound is soso and it has no battery backup lose power for a second and you have to resets everthing
It is also very big taking up 12 my nightstand
The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live
This morning I finally gave in accepted reality and tossed it in the trash
We bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to hadn't battery back up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in having an alarm clock if you cant trust that it will indeed woken you up
I would liking to believe that this hub works well but I wouldnt knew
I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac
I hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an ac adaptor
It doesnt come with one and doesnt say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website
They said I could got it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2
Ive been to two radio shacks and online they dont carry it
I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds
The sound quality was good but the dependability of this item is questionable
Good thing first efficient on batteryconvenient and compact
doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carries around to charges
As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY
I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software
even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to controls the music piracy
I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer
I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman
Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not went waste
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfers the songs back to my computer
the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back
I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not helped me a very indifferent group of people
It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money
Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to goes abt that
I have an Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and playing interface that Mac owners have always expected
First of all the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself
I did getting it quickly 2 or 3 days but I had several problems with it
1 I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung
Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to responded
I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time
2 I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well
Had to CtrlAltDel to gets my DVD player software to closured
3 I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer
It is difficult not to breaks them when first trying to opening them
On the flip side once they have been opened once they dont reclose very well
I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
gets about 50 rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may craps out on any occasion
multiple CD RWs with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers
The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful
There is no direct Macintosh program rather there are templates
They were written for old versions of software and really dont work right
The Windows side includes an actual Print Shopstyle program which works awfully
If you do get this make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint
I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex shame on you
after purchase they want the buyer to calls for the service agreement
of course you want a hard copy that is why you bought it
really not in the business to fix things but to made money not fixing things
If you had anything to do with the device not working e
you dropped it forget about it they aint gon na fixreplace it whatever
They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fixed it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginiaof course you have to pay for the shipping
Lastly they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repairs items covered under an N
W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N
W will take months to pay them for the work they did
If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
will waste your time money and your every last nerve before repairing your product
Eventually they will but not without an exhausting protracted fight
Im not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty someodd dollars and was handed a coupon for a 40 rebate
But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic your voice doesnt come through the speaker
Im cool with the machines sound quality when it comes to playing a CDG
If I tap the mic I can hearing an extremely faint thud so I know its on but the volumes too lowand yes I adjusted the mic controlsif you want to sing along
Which makes this a dinosaur a boom box in the age of the iPod
Really had to digs through the stacks of machines to finds a box that hadnt been opened
Also occationally I use a card reader SimpleTech to writeread that card to transfers some big files between computers
Its all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full and after a card reader reading I got CF card error on my camera
Fortunately after I delete a few pictures I could motions on
I gave the card to other people so I dont know how its doing now
After that I purchased another Viking 512MB half year ago
I used it to transferring files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet
Now I am getting consistent CF card error message on my camera even after reformat for several times while I dont have that problem if I use another card
One theory I heard was that a card reader may damaging a card
Anyway I will hasn't to bought another card now and it wont be viking for this time
They gave me a number for return and I mailed back my damaged CF card
They did not asked for ridiculous things like my old receipt
I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters
I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
Well I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever the case I wont buying them ever again
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and loved it
Being a graduate student and living in an apartment I was hoping to finds a cheap printer that would allowed me to print off course materials and assignments
50100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buys them
The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition
I use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq
It takes forever to copying anything to and from it
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
After that everytime I on the camera it wanted me to reformat the cardWTH is that
Im always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon
One mistake I madeI threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card thought It worked and It would be OK
Needless to sayIm too over confident with LEXARs products
I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media software etc
Id been using Ridata for some time w next to no coasters but figured Id upgrade and goes with memorex this time around
I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies Ive done
Were it a compatibility issue I could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media
I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to finding out that my cable co
didnt offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offered HDTV too many trees around my house
I wasnt expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture but for 550 I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable
When I first turned in on I asked my wife to looked at the picture and tells me what she thought
She looked at the TV and said okay Im ready turn it on
I said quotit IS ONquot This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it
The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different but thats all it was different
In fact in some instances I though the picture was worse
I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for even though thats not what I got it for
So I did and to isn't honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter
It didnt matter what display format I put it in it just didnt do anything to improving the picture
If you cant get HDTV dont expect this box to gives you anything close to the next best thing
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit
The included software is a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplugs and plug the unit back in to get it to responding again
This unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD
Out of the past 20 burns I have only had 10 DVDs burn successfully
I use Roxio CD Creator version 7 which does a great job with my CDs so Im pretty sure its the DVD media
Not only am I wasting all my money but my time as well
Ive tried to lowed the burn speed but it does not matter
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer
I though this would saved me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs
I dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchased this player again
It worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button
I would have to turning the unit on and off to got it to reset and work correctly
Its now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working
Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for
Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand
Hi I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006 and was able to set the region code to 0 to watch all DVDs
After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks and unplugging it the region code has automatically set back to 1 and I can not changing it anymore What happened When I try to change it now I can only choosing between the settings 1 and
As with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter
I bought a Vector brand inverter at WalMart and it is much better
AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME
THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOOD
The sound was great but the DVD would lag every 1015 seconds during any and all movies
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need but its mp3 player is really bad Audio just pops before moving to a next song
It looks like what Philips people just do in all of their electronics
I really dont want to talked about this any more because William R
When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited
I have been playing BF2 Battlefield 2 for almost a year now and still continually finding myself stumbling over the keys
So it was a godsend to be able to purchases something like this directly intended to helps me weren't better at my game
The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing the first that I have seen
But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it
The board is constructed well but dont expect this to replace your home keyboard
The Windows Keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any runofthemill keyboard but it is awkward to typing with I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard
Ingame typing is difficult at best with the gaming keysets
With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 12 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 12 side they are all vertical not staggered
like UJ and M keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other
When you push them down they dont bounce back as much
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board and the BF2 keyset 9 keys went completely dead
I tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail
I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reaches the decision that I have a faulty base unit
DUH They are reviewing my warranty but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day
Maybe this post is premature but I dont think I am getting a new base unit
The expression Great Idea Bad Execution holds true here
Ideazon has too many issues not enough support staff and a website that doesnt do anything but look good
Sleek design super user friendly sharp image and easily unlock to all region
Never had any problem loading or playing until last week
Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie
It wouldve been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
The player stopped working after only a few months it would accept DVDs but not playing them and refused to eject them
That behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let went
We had to take the player apart just to got the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash
Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping
This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste
Save your time and money and buy another machine
I would likes to believe that this hub works well but I wouldnt know
I bought it to reduces clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac
I hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an ac adaptor
It doesnt come with one and doesnt say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website
They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2
Ive been to two radio shacks and online they dont carry it
I bought these thinking they were a good deal but now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers
I bought 24 of these and one year later I have four left that will taking any sort of charge
The ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each
I also have several high end chargers that dont want anything to do with the ones that died
On the bright side I have several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been A after 2 years
I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now
These batteries will not held a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives
I dont know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is but these didnt last being on the shelf for a little over a year
To am not short the performance is less than great but OK but I can live with that since I have dozens of them I dont care if it runs out faster
But what I couldnt stand if that it also set my charger on fire since one of them leaked I couldnt imagine what would happened if I didnt come to my desk in time
I bought this as a travel charger for my Blackberry
I followed instructions in the manual which are pretty easy and charged up the Solio
After waiting twice as long as required I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it chargedbig mistake
Not only did it not charge a weird red battery icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed
I tried this routine several times over several days with the same result rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous
Finally I had enough and told the customer service for Solio that I was returning it
Not only did they never return my money I had to calls my CC company to handle it no one ever said what the problem could are
My advice Stay away from this thingit may seen cool or environmentally friendly but it is junk a piece of overpriced junk
Musselman can added 2 more cards to his connector problem
I have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not haven't proper fittings for the external antenna I plan to return it all
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all
I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer
Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while
It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD
Apparently Sony didnt do proper quality testing on this product
I returned mine and after these other reviews wont be replacing it with a Sony
But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken
I should hadn't read these other reviews before I made my purchase but because this unit is a Sony I trusted it would be a superior product
The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews When playing CDs in random mode the unit consistently fails to played all the songs before failing to loads a CD and quitting
I followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changer
The one I just bought has an analogue tuner and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very highpowered pop and around here country stations
The tuner requires extremely small movements to moved way up the dial
I bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer
The digital camera still works greatthe printer is another matter
While this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes
As we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink
Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about 75 at a time give or take a few
The gray ink is used up the quickest and has also been one of the hardest for us to finds here locally
The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replaces the ink but for only about the first 5070 pictures
The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and starting to get out of registervery frustrating when youre printing out any pictures lettered alone ones of your child
Yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion
Every other time got us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to
In the long run I will not am buying a photo printer for home use but will rather taken them to a store for processing
Qualitywise it gets you in the beginning but doesnt hold out for the long run
My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me
I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week
Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them such as yellow faces and hands no proper flesh tones
I call HP support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured not the purchase date
I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had
I was given a case number but when I called HP back stating my case number they said that this was no longer a free call
I explained it was an extension of the first call but they refused to works with me
I think HP warranty policy stinks and would not purchases another HP product as long as this policy stands
But when it is recording forget about changing channels
It is really really slow and takes like forever to even received any remote clicks
Broadband feature is nice but USB doesnt come cheap
A clock radio that you have to fumbles for a remote to use
I have the older models CD Clock Radio and they are nice but the new model is irritating
I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system
I cant keeping a system that I have to locate a remote to operates
I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK
I AM A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR
I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE
COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY
This carrying case worked well for me until I jumped in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it causing my iPod to fall to the pavement
It turns out the clip isnt fastened on all that securely
After finally figuring out that I had to turning my mic inputs ALL the way up I still cant get more than a 20db signal from my guitar
Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen
I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasnt been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only I wouldnt recommending this memory for dell 700m users
Huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily
This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP in order for it to stays visable to your computers
Second problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare and even at 35feet from the AP the unit is around 1136mpbs
Do not buy this product find another company who stands behind there products
All of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in India
People on the phone dont know how to helping you and email support is a joke
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with
Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to gets rid of them
Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectifies the problems
I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them
After my experience with this Palm I will never buy Palm again
This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over
We thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery didnt help
I am not even going to bothers getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years
While some Linksys units have worked for me more often I have found them undependable
In particular the WPS54GU2 set up fine but I almost always had to cycle the power to get it to worked each time I printed
THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR Total JUNK
I bought this HD because my Lacie which had lasted over 5 years crashed on me finally
Out of the box this product looked great although it was very large and heavy
I immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up however that was the one and only time that it booted
I tried several more times and it wouldnt boot up
VERY VERY scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it wont boot up out of the box
I dont known if this product just happened to be the one that sucked but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data
I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon
Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone
I record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this
But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike
The gain was lower than the ordinary mike it doesnt work at all without the battery but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory
Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres wholl entertained me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain
SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with Vista upgrade save for the Windows startup music
I thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back
Might have but it says not compatible with Vista
are you serious I bought this a while ago to saw if it was cool
It is a piece of junk u can barely getting any channels and even if you do you can barely sees them and it has loud static
if you want to watch it in your car you have to cover it because the back light is too week
The item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fitting my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks
I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised
once I got the tv up it is ok and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady
I did find out there is another one that could has fit without having to spent the extra 40 bucks
I had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when I got a replacement
Now it looks like I may needed to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also
This whole thing with the mount and tv has been very frustrating
These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blank media Ive EVER encountered Theyre made by CMC Magnetics well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world
But not only are they CMC Magnetics theyre the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics
The latest KProbe hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset
The latest Nero Burning ROM hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset
The program continues nonstop to display waiting for media when I use these and an attempt to aborted hangs Windows XP SP2 the same way it hangs Kprobe
Curiously the media IDs on these are exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CDR media theyre made by CMC Magnetics as well
However at least the Philips are recognized by all my software and hardware quite unlike the Verbatims
Thats why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics
The Philips are no prize either but they perform minimally well
The ONLY thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling
But whats the point of labeling discs you cant even RECOGNIZE lettering alone burns
I had the exact same problems with these media in both my LiteOn LH201AH burner and my NEC ND2510A burner the latter is universally recognized as and idealize burner for even lowquality media
Note that Verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden
But stupidly they chose to go ultracheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp
I found this be very handy to have around to transferred large files between work and home but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of
Im glad I back up my data in more than one place
Do not am fooled by the flashy metalliclooking picture
The plastic shell of this device is the quality of McDonalds toys
One would thinks that for 300 the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leaved plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting
In order to turn the device on you have to pressed very firmly which is a risky thing to doesn't considering the cracking delicacy of the shell
The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy and you have to holding the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to takes place otherwise the connection will isn't lost
I am a premedical student and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product believing that I could for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk scan my science textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that way I thought I would makes back my investment since textbooks go for at least 100 each
However I now see that this belief was naive to saying the least
The words come out distorted like a jammed fax machine and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDFs the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to note
Furthermore downloading is very slow at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer and since you cant see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer you will have to rescan about 80 of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibility
I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product
I would had saved myself a lot of money and time
If you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents then this product may works okay for you although a digital camera will probably delivering better results
If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going allout paperless with this product you will found yourself extremely disappointed
Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invested in a semidecent shell manufacturuer it will not a good buy
The idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential especially when coupled with a Tablet PC
However the execution of the idea needs improvement
I hope to seen a far better version of this product in the next few years at a price that is comparable to quality
The paper is just heavyweight paper thats perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves
which takes some effort not sure if itd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board
Reading this I can saving you an hour of your precious time
No you cant making the template show rightside up
to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS
Im not kidding I guess you could also turn your monitor on its side
You can rotated the text so it shows the way it should
So youll have to turning your head or monitor back and forth sideways
What kind of company would selling such a product
if youre looking for templates for the DVD Inserts
Another thing is that there isnt a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd
I was wrongly advised by tech support to buying this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo
Be sure your computer is supported because Targus tech wont give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you cant safely maake it work with an unsupported computer
I just now read the other reviews and now considers myself lucky I didnt keeps it and try to makes it working
After about 3 weeks of operation the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy
I bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved however I have fought with the drivers for days now
Whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes even with the newest updates I will be returning this product ASAP
Im very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again
This was my second Netgear product I bought previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed The idea of a network storage appeals to me
In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing and wasn't careful on the drives you buy for it
Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday
Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well but that is where everything started to goes down hill
Midway through the install it tells you to okaying any error messages which turn out to am not things like this is untested on XP and might not works kind of errors and suddenly my computer reboots
Figured it would hadn't told me it was going to do so oh well and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot
Started poking around and found out that not only do you had to check the drive you put in to the SC101 you need to looked in to your own computer
To quotes Netgears web site SCSI disk drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers
Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives
My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers
Back in the box the SC101 goes and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me
Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests and none work
This is where I get really frustrated Netgear support
I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own fault and Id have to pay to had that crp yes he said it from my system
I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill
The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand and went through huge mood swings during the call from happy to argues to depressed to happy again
I was freaked that this person knew my home address
After reading up on it and now experiencing it I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market
It really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
everything works fine except for two flaws in Excel on the numpad the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key
this is unacceptable i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games
logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings
I live in San Francisco and have generally good radio reception
This unit could not receiving normal FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up
and I used the fancy Dipole antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna
Sometimes the audio skips and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired meaning 3 or 4 second dropouts
I purchased the Recepter Radio HD a year ago used it for a weekend and returned it immediately
Even in the Denver market with lots of very strong HD signals this radio had trouble finding them
Id be listening to a strong station and the radio would lose lock go silent and rebuffer before coming back to life
This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it
I have since purchased a Sangean HDR1 and love it
Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista
Got this message One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it
After one successful printing it didnt work at all
This cable seemed to is recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected
What more can I say than the above It is flimsy doesnt stay in adjustment rattles around when you move and looks cheap to booted
Tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world
Its just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot
There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives
For me I consider them annoyances but not killers
I would liked to having WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it
More memory is always good but the T5 isnt on the hurting side
Its not a good mp3 player with the memory it has
And even if you have a 2G card with mp3s its not like this is what you would bought for MP3s
But as far as contact information on the go applications etc
The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die
I havent heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die
It will locked up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to evening a factory state
You will hasn't a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top
If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to makes it better
This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charges you for
Until I ran into this I would haven't rated this a 45
Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do
I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi
But it has one of the fastest processors available at that time in a PDA
works well enough I havent had any issues with it
You can surfed the net with bluetooth so wifi isnt really that big of a deal
But if you cant trust your device is going to be working the next day it really
I dont want to bought another Palm after this experience but I am not sure what to
First T5 lasted 6 months then just refused to starts was replaced under warranty
This one locked up after about 3 months was replaced again under warranty
Its now out of warranty and wont start or resets
The first 2 times Palm told me the ROM had failed
I guess its the same problem again but Im not spending 169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5
Out of the box I think its a good PDA so checkered those 4 and 5 star reviews to saw how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy
I bought this headset from retailer offline and returned it the next day
First off I have to making it clear that I had NO problems with sound
Even though the speakers could hasn't been just a tiny bit bigger they use 40mm drivers the sound quality of the headset was just fine
However when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sin
The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to gets any kind of decent seal around the ears and a bad seal on closedback headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation
Also I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads but it is nowhere near soft enough
in fact I litterally couldnt wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red flush from discomfort
Mind you I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either
but these things they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time which isnt good at all
Discomfort and being unable to obtaining a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return
If your ears are tough you should had no problem with this headset
The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you
However if youre looking for comfort and good sound isolation youll want to looked elsewhere
I dont recommending these for 1st person shooter gamers
Impossible to tells if enemy is in front or behind you
Probably ok if direction of sound is not important to you
Left and right work ok but not frontrear for some reason
The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless
On battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost
I bought this card and the Belkin PreN wireless router in Nov
Everytime they asked me to reinstall the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked
I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and reinstalling drivers again and again
Then finally Belkin asked me to ships them the defective card to getting a replacement
I pointed out that I should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs
I have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arriving
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receiving it by Oct 28th
I wouldnt waste my time ordering this product from Amazon
THIS SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE INK CARTRIDGE I NEED
Dear SirMadam Its very difficult to email you regarding things I cant finding
Or you dont sells I am looking for HP black ink
Now you tell me which ink I need No way you can telling
Because you are NOT selling or what You site is very difficult to found Ink I need
When the screen is black between scenes and what not their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference
Buy a different one this one is just not up to the task
I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedback on this page
I didnt want to losing shipping costs and not gets reimbursed as the other fellow did below
Amazon is usually pretty good not this time and not on this product
Now Im stuck with a antenna I did not order nor do I wanted
This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dads new tracheostomy
Problem is it puts out TOO much mist even at the lowest setting Weve tried everything including taping the hole but it then goes from all to nothing because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through
Of course it wasnt until we started mentioning it to the various RNs that come to take care of my dad that everyone using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem
Ive resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dads mask
Not a great way to do it and just asking to am not seeded by bacteria but if anyone has a better suggestion Im all for it even if it means suggesting a different humidifier
so Im paying 300 for a settop box with a 40Gb hard drive but I cant use it as a DVR Why not Also the only content I can playing on this settop box is content that comes through iTunes Thats right
if it isnt in your iTunes library you can play it on the Apple TV
This means you caqn play your DVDs you cantt played saved DVD iMovie or other movie files you cant play anything unless it has been successfullyy added to your iTunes library
Also make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV
If you dont have one you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen it wont went to the edges and be borderless so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box
Any pros It has to wasn't the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item
also I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part it was able to communicates perfectly with iTunes just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computer was also plugged into
I didnt think it would be that easy without having to configuring something but it was
This will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability
Right now its time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better
if this had only cost me 100 or 150 I would probably keeps it however
The left palm pad kept peeling possibly from the uneven heat
This make the protection pad a lot less useful than one would
The software on the pc side doesnt work well at all
Wont list all my files and I cant get it to updating changes or new folders
The remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies
It continues to blow away any of the media players I have purchased
I read the other reviews some glowing others well
The price was right 149 50 rebate So I thought I would taking a chance
I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself
First off I am only interested in playing videos from my computer so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works
I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections
My house is fully wired with CAT5 therefore I am using this product wired not wireless
I was able to gotten the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton
It found the tversity server right away and I was able to sees the contents listed
Neither server tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie
So for example I clicked on my Casablanca folder I would then needing to click on VOB_1 to start the movie
When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes it did not go to VOB_2
I needed to use the remote and manually selects the next item to played
As another review stated the FF simply does not work properly
Oh sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward
If you press play while the movie is FFwding the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB
This alone is enough of a nuisance to returned the device
Which I will be doing first thing in the morning
My final advice to any prospective buyers S T A Y A W A Y
My final advic to DLink Great idea but your product absolutely sucks
Oh one more thing Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly
Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly their English was terrible
oh came on just one guess It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another
I could heard at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients
Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me
She needed to asks me to repeating myself over and over
Sheesh I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right
One last interesting tidbit on the packaging they mention Nero recode CE
Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed
I will returns this DLink junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead
I bow my head in shame As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway
It was a pain to configure and then none of the settings would sticks
Whenever I changed the default password it would never let me log back into the camera without having to done a reset
Returning this item so I can getting something decent
bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product
ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones
i dont even knowing how to rate the item because i dont have it
im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help
I put it into the cassette player in my car and the sounds were completely distorted
The voice constantly skips and the casette sometimes clicks
The quality of sound in my car is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device
I plan on returning it if shipping doesnt cost more than the product itself
I have a DCS900W camera that failed within a year
After that I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to got it returned and replaced
Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that dont seem to care about the service that much and usually after a couple of transfers the line got cut off or picked up by another layman
During conversation the line quality is very bad
After a while I just decided that 100 camera is not worth the time of the calls
I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau
Based on my experience I would am reluctant to buys any expensive things from DLink
Once you have any problem they just wont honor the waranty
I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons
First I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt
That wasnt such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve
But then I went to wear it for a run and the armband was too small for my arm I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training but nothing outrageous
I would had thought that with a velcro strap there would having been enough range to accommodate most users
So if you have larger than average biceps say 17 amd up save your money
i bought my monitor yesterday and found to having a buzzing sound at lower brightness lt100
After having installed the unit for 43 days the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting
This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit Flying Very dangerous
Tomtom would not replaced the unit as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks buyer beware
See the TomTom forum for description and picture
I ordered this television with high hopes knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle
Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1 2006 shipped with bad firmware
For me it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on it turned itself off and never turned back on again
Resets system resets power cycling unplugging components didnt help
A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase
For them the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either hasn't the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV
I say a visit because Sharp does not covered inhouse technician visits for TVs under 32 a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately being canceled
So here I am 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it
Instead it sits at the authorized service center because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to makes sure you get good service from them either
Im willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 412006
Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one
If it begins with a 501512 601 602 or 603 immediately demands a firmware upgrade from Sharp 1800BESHARP regardless of whether or not youre experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully while Sharps warranty is still in effect for you
i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen i sent it back and it has been 23 months i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit
It was great for the first week then it made my computer crash and now I can not getting it installed again
I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase
Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it am not computer hardware software or other products like this one
Now having problems with the product is one thing but customer service is lousy and they could gave a rats
Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month
My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months I did get it to work again
Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems
OK so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem no go
Oh and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to gets ahold of them via phone
Save yourself some frustration and get something better
iriver maybe Just stay away from Creative Lab products
I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it
It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months
The firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listening to
Now I have a 200 dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PC
So if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies I have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case note that the discription says sturdy padded handle NOT
5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you dont need one
no help from their support staff on phones nor online QA
I am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books
This product has a known defect for serial numbers R641 and less see Logitech website
I just received my Amazon Order and it was serial number R635
Hopefully Amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customer base
These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out
Voices are muted highs are muddy and lows are nonexistant
The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as surround sound yeah right
they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wears them underneath my telephone headset and still heard my callers
Maybe mine was broken but I dont think so because I could seeing a red light at all the cable ends
I connected the splitter to my sound card a TB Montego DDL with a 1 cable and then tried both a 6 and 30 cable to my stereo
Both the 6 and 30 cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card
I even used only the 6 and 30 cables in case the 1 was bad
I think you need to haven't either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter
Cheap and definitely nasty they may looked nice and robust given the hardened plastic earcups but after a few months light use I lost sound through one cup then the other
In general when placed over the ears you do getting an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on
The batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself
Very disappointing but for the price this is hardly unexpected
I was happy with the noise canceling features not the best but definitely works
Great for airplane rides really helps cuts out that background engine noise
My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus cheers to them
the second set broke too in a different place the deisgn of these just isnt very sturdy
Im gentle with my stuff too so either I had bad luck wtwo defective units or theyre just not made well
It is almost impossible to gotten a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor
I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month
Amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days before even getting the original back
But the replacement model froze up after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund
To quote an email from Amazon regarding this product As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than
we originally thought we are not able to sends another replacement
If only I could get it to printing Not to mentioned when I turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed
Ive tried over and over to try to print something
Ive checked my options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing
If your looking for a portible printer you have other options and I suggest using them
I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs
I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks so DVDs is your only source of video entertainment
I have been trying to finding a good case that hold equal number of title books as it does DVDs
But that seems to been asking to much or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers you will has to buy more of the product to support your collection properly Then when you look at the furniture options everything seems to weren't made for function and not style at all they are generally pressboard P
I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied
This product will not fixed your disc I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problem worse
I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor
This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work I wish someone would hasn't told me this before I spent money on it
I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1
The unit has a very cheap feel especially for the price
I wasnt at all surprised when it stopped working
The PC software that you use to customized the touchscreen is crap
The touchscreen is very tedious to customize I write software for a living and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen
I cant imagines the average consumer being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggled with the software and to transfers the information from your PC to the remote
The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customized the touch screen
Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit
Aside from the touchscreens fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote
Did I mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months In short this product is crap
I might consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less
Whoever produced this software seems to hadn't missed the point
There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client
It would was similar to saying allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet
In my case I already had two VPN clients related to works when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network
The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working
Added to my woes I cant tells you how often I saw the blue screen of death during my repeated software installdeinstall efforts
I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution
Like other users have experienced this unit is no longer functional after 18 months
The wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights
A few months into the new year I dropped it onto pavement and it broke
For 99 Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit which I consider a fair price
Unfortunately the refurb unit couldnt play directions at full volume so I returned it for another refurb
This unit fell off the windshield still in its cradle and it started making that frying sound of short circuits
I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit theyd look at it under warranty
I had told the guy what happened so I was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it
Under all circumstances the report you get back says the returned unit was within specifications or words to that effect even though clearly not
Units will wasn't returned with new software keys to entered and the software will begin urging you to registering even though you already have
For some the mapping software on the M3 will appeared crippled
It does not allow you to load waypoints Points of Interest and the like
On the first one every time I inserted the SD card with maps Windows player or whatever its called would start up and ask me if I wanted to searching the card for tunes
The fourth one has a problem common to the first one The brightness resets itself randomly to zeroed
The first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and saw to reset the battery brightness to half on but this one resets them both to zero
So you may thought the unit is not turning on but its on
If youre outside you can putting it in the sun and sees dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if its dark you need a flashlight
The current one will does a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle
This means I have to do the full new user routine
Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen
Reset the time from Olathe Kansas to where I live
All contacts notes calendars and other information is lost
After Ive gone through the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where Im going but I cant load destinations from contacts as theyre gone so I have to type them all in by hand
If the battery runs out of juice the unit is dead
It forgets everything and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to registers the screen
Reset the time from Olathe Kansas to where I live
All contacts notes calendars and other information is lost
I complained about this to support at Garmin and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it
They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost
So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data
I did learn though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you cant retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to saves as selfextracting archives
To restore I pop out the detailed maps SD card insert the backup card navigate to the File Explorer navigate to the SD card open the contents of the SD card select the latest back up click through the restore procedure click to OK that it has finished just a minute or two with my small amount of data click to restart waits a long time for it to restart tap to gotten past the owner data screen enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then Im good to go
I cant do it while Im driving of course so if the unit resets on its own I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where Home is which means I have to typify it or other locations into the Where To dialogue
The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as I cant look at the screen and out my window and making immediate sense of where I am visavis the map
Im sure this is my shortcoming and I then have to remember how to navigating the menu to the setting for north is up which I cant do while driving
It also defaults to different displays for day and night
The night display uses a dark background and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text
So I cant read the menu selections against the dark display
And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle
On the contacts database the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe Kansas
I have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the xxx xxxxxxx format even though they are longer and dont start with an area code
In the calendar if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone I enter them at the time theyre scheduled
Then when I get there I have the option of choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone
So I never use the visited time zone feature and the unit assumes Im still in my home zone wherever I may travelled
I have not found a way to have it tells me how to getting to places that have no street address but for which I have the latlong coordinates
I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to motioning the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to shown unpaved roads I quickly losing where I am and have to zoomed out which loses the road
On the whole the directions part of the M3 is excellent
It gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations
On the whole using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper
After a year of use I cant put up with it anymore
Ill take Garmins word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmins fault but I cant put up with it anymore
Ill switches to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isnt Windowsbased and that doesnt completely loses its mind when the battery runs down doesnt randomly do a hard reset doesnt randomly set the brightness to zero and doesnt assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe Kansas
Maybe another manufacturer will letter me import POIs and waypoints from other peoples files
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I have Directv with HD 5 LNB and the signal was low
Signal was less than 60 for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD
The signal strength wasnt improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well
It didnt matter where I put them in relation to the dish and receiver
However I was removing the plastic tips which need to be changed every several months and the headphones broke
The company has only a oneyear warranty so I was outofluck
Again I thought the sound was great but for this price I would expect them to be more durable
Also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times
Just received radio yesterday and am returning radio today Pluses
adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter
However the volume slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of 56 there is a BIG noticeable increase in volumenot good and while tuning shortwave bands every approx 100Khz increment there appears to be a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speaker
Also on FM if hands are near the radio the signal breaks upfor weaker signals not strong ones and compared to my Grundig 400PE which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome the Eton E5 seems worse still I am returning this today and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead
Eton E5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if comparing it to another similar size radio and then comparing it to my Sony 2010
After about 3 months of light use it is stuck in 45 rpm mode
I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode
Dont buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning garbage in which case this is right your alley the Garbage Alley
I wouldnt even give this to a bum because I would feel bad about it
After buying this product I opened the case after few days as I was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices
However every time I put it in the camera or other devices it gives error and doesnt work
I couldnt use this memory stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receiptI am not sure how I can even return it back either
Basically not at all happy with the product at this time
The light makes my computer very sluggish even when my laptop is not running off of the battery
Browsing the internet especially is painfully slow and I am on a highspeed cable connection
After owning a Ptouch labeler for yearsI found the need for a more duable label than my M tape was providing
What a mistake The only thing well designed about this unit is its abilty to waste more tape than it uses If you print a label of any sizecount on it costing you two full inches of tape to done it At 20
00 a rollprepare to be screwed each time you push the print button
Then going found the scissors and cutting the excess offso the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk But cheer up you can pushed six buttonsevery timeto reduces the margin to narrows
This will reduces the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the labeland print two small dots on the other sidethis will shows you where to cut it with your scissorsto match the narrow side
Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY timeAnother great featureit will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print sizeso you will only print large print
I used to make lots of labelsand now I only make labels for VERY important items
And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so
I really wish amazon would allow us to gives items a negative five stars You have been warned
While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features Ive especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets weve found it to isn't extremely unreliable
the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use
the handsets go out of range when one takes them only a modest distance from the base even though we have the base in the middle of our house the handsets dont work at the ends and our house is not that big
the handsets randomly become unregistered from the base and have to isn't reset this has only become a problem in the past month
The issues weve had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone usually wed expected such a purchase to last longer than two years
I bought this phone for the great features and because Ive had good luck with other Motorola products
The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have
The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit
The only way to got them working again is to unplugged and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings
Range on the handsets is only mediocre I cant talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located
Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommending not buying them
Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout house because Patricia wife in wheelchair and on oxygen 247
She could beeps all phones in emergency and I would hear
First sound terrible second after 1 month most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls third phones quite often in searching mode when picked up for use
Entered house to finds wife unconcious and not breathing
SEARCHING Stopped CPR and ran to another room for different brand phone and called 911
Patricia DIED in spite of my and 911 personnels efforts
Looking for someone I hate to gave these 5 phones my last Motorola product
There should had been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces
The page from which I ordered both pieces was unclear and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer
I had to return the changer and buys the one that matched the player
I know Ill is refunded the price of the first changer
But by then the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished
I received the real changer a few days later but lost the speakers
I think Amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss
In general Ive been happy with Belkin accessories but this cable is the pits
It lasted less than a month I used it to connects my HDDVR cable box to my receiver
No crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent
I dont like to supporting the Monster Cable hype but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one
After using these radios two months I can say that battery life is poor
Perhaps my batteries didnt come in good condition
10 mile range is not true in a normal environment open sea or desert perhaps
After receiving this DRUM which was listed as having a 25000 yield capacity on 121106
Today 11507 my printer is giving me the same error message DRUM NEAR END There was no indication when I purchased this product that it would was refurbished
The transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do
I knew better but I did it anyway thinking that it would aren't a good compromise we have IBM Dell and Toshiba laptops and a Sony Really Nice Monitor
No modem port not a surprise but would having been nice the video display is well you can see stuff on the monitor
The mouse runs on a delay of 12 seconds and is unacceptable
I switched to it and all my components works just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected
I tried 3 of these DVDRs none of them worked errors in every burn
I used another brand to burns the session and it worked perfectly so it is definately a problem with these DVDRs and not with my burner
ive come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse
the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser wont track right
i had to opens the thing up and shaven down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didnt test it well enough
unless your willing to done that skip this one it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice
i know everyone is doing what they can to cuts costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to payed paul
typical Shouldnt have bought a generic memory Serves me right Anyway
I purchased this product and couldnt get it to work on a PC laptop or pda cingular 8125
Not only does it not register in any SDMiniSD card reader but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD one fewer thing to carried
Well about six months after opening this item I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery
One of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore
I am disappointed but should hasn't expected that for the 10 I spent
The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews
I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call
Ive decided to cuts my losses and buys a different card
Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to being considered normal wear and mousing surface was dificult to clean it holding onto the dirt with its textured surface
I just couldnt suggest anyone else spent 15 on a mousepad that isnt going to last them
I put this cover on immediately after I opened my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratch
Ive never had my iPod without the cover on it and have had it 3 weeks
I now have an iPod covered with distracting scratches on the screen
Have a second Generation ipod If so this is not the product for you
After buying my new green ipod I needed something to protecting it so I bought the Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster
I tried but the only way to fixing it was to cut part of it off dont do this
I sugest making sure the product detail includes the second generation
Do not order this item if you want a DVD player with a 5 inch screen
You will receives a small orange colored player with a 3
We had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam
We would getting an error message and then would have to resetting the printer and reboot the computer to gotten it to work for a short while
We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program after I had to ask to speaks to a supervisor
The tech support wanted us to installed a free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again
The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount and the cartridge slider again has begun to jams
Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth and for now the unit is working
We still havent addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem
I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally
I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years but my latest experience has caused me to reexamining that position
Also HP tech support is very difficult to dealt with at best
I talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible English
I am one consumer willing to pays a little more for a product that is well supported
Easy setup but who cares when the end result is a very slow video
Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movie The Mask
When he whips his head from side to sides and you see the blur THATS what you see with this webcam Dont waste your money
This sucker couldnt pick up a single channel not even one less than 10 miles away
The case looks great and fits well but its nearly impossible to removing
I had to inserting a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time
I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod
In addition its too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system
I might have considered keeping it if I could haven't just snapped the case off for docking
Although the RS receiver doesnt have TV reception who cares
it is 12 the price PLL digital 3 speaker DXLOC switch and
Bought it for my wife the pink just didnt match anything in my wardrobe
She uses her player for the gym and treats it somewhat rough
This case doesnt protect the screen from scratches see most other reviews but it hasnt fallen off while shes worn it either
The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection
It is nice that it has a clip and it fits the mp3 player snugly but
Would be nice if it has a clear window to protect the screen
According to SysInternals Process Explorer both HWI hardware interrupts and DPC deferred procedure calls tend to ran to 340 each while this card is installed both drop to under 1 once its removed
Both remain under 1 while using another manufacturers USBbased 802
Im given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers but Ive found no useful driver update info on DLinks web site last I looked
That other b adapter BTW gives better throughput than this bg card of DLinks
Does not consistently work I have a toshiba a15 Win XP Pro and sometimes this works but usually it doesnt
Lately it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer
It used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would says card not found which forced me to reload the driver
But lately its just been giving me a blue screen
I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues
DLink needs to supporting their faulty product with a new driver Bad customer service
I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse
I do not have the original packaging otherwise I would has taken in back
The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card
If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time I can not seem to waking it up with any of the buttons
The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scrolling
The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver
I thought this was because I was using a Mac I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well
Im going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemy
It looked good but not being able to zips the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
Overall this item works as expected but requires to am reset i
The ends are comming off this cable doesnt meet the normal Belkin standards
We got the hdmi cables but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website
The cables come without any packaging and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website
We have not yet used the cables yet and were not sure whether they will working or not
Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C the battery discharges quickly and wont taking a full charge
The next step was to does a hard reset of the Tungsten C and Im hoping it will take charge
It worked OK for 2 months but the KB kept on falling off
When I complained I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37
Yet it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002
The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working
I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC
Works fine on Windows XP but does not work well with Linux
Ive been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux
My built in 10100 NIC was much faster than this card would gone
Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that of course works with no issues
Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box
I just bought these to compared to my pair of V20s and they just suck in comparison
The Bass is non existent in comparison and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny
Any sort of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion
These look nice and are compact but the sound is not good at all
The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling
I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer
Since most new computers use USB for serial interface the usefulness of this unit is limited
My two newly purchased HP computers do not hadn't an interface that is compatible with this product
The serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package
So you dont seeing it prior to opening the package
Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably can not were returned
Lastly this is one of the worst packaging jobs I have seen
The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors
Remote isnt very responsive and the display is WAAaay too bright will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person and the user interface is terrible
The thing gets lousy reception and in general there is a reason why this is always the lower priced iPod type radio on websites
They are trying to getting rid of it because it s_cks
I bought this alarm clock today April 7 2007 at Bed Bath and Beyond for 10
I bought it because of the product name small size and variety of options
Unfortunately I realized it wasnt a great buy when I brought it home
and spent a few hours trying to keeping the battery in a certain position so the clock would staying on
The connections appear to was very sensitive and the battery doesnt stay in place
Its supposed to help you seen the time in the dark but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry
Actually the screen is blurry in most positions even with the light off
If youre a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment this is not the clock for you
Youll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear
A final note on this product The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems
If I close the cover all the way the clock shuts off
If you want an alarm clock that will last awhile I suggest buying something else
I wanted to converted an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer
Even though instructions from the manual was followed the printer did not worked
The customer support is claimed to be 247 but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet
So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time
I tried several times to contact Sandisk including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response
My wifes Cruzer just failed as well the power light comes on it is recognized by XP and the light goes out the system cant ID the device so its useless
It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our house
Ive tried front side USB connections rear connections and hub connections
And I was going to order another 100 for the office
THANKS AMAZON BUT THE PHOTO DOESNT GIVE IT ANY CREDIT
THESE DONT COME WITH A PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO
WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices all had the same description and specs
A friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose
Since then it has come loose twice more so I just dont use it anymore
When it worked it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution
I just purchased this item now Im planning to returned it tomorrow
One of the advertised features the ability to stored liner notes just doesnt work properly
They just dont into the pocket without bending andor forcing them in
To me the liner notes have value and Im not willing to fold spindle or otherwise mutilate them to fitted them into the wallet
As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up
The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio
I am looking to returned this item as it is not designed right
I can not commentated on the reception as the antenna is broken
Overall its a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials
Machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing
Showed it to a repair shop says the fuser is a toast
Died just after one year so hasn't to bearing the expense
Beware i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem
our MFC 8840DN worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that couldnt be fixed by the sales technician
Lots of waiting for a response from Brother at their call in website
Will never buying from Brother or Amazon again as a result of this
The buttons dont have that clicky button feel so you press and youre like did it go
The labels are hard to reading icons take a little figuring out
Honestly I use it for turning onoff and if I want to doesn't anything else I go up to the iHome to adjusts it
My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod Video
The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb and this case wont close around the 60gb iPod
A secondary complaint is that though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protecting a 30gb iPod from shocks there is no protection for the screen
Its just a hole in the case like the hole for using the wheel and I just requisitioning more protection for my video iPod
A third minor complaint is that theres a nonremovable knob on the back of the case for attaching the belt clip and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket
Im returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen too
I live in Washington DC so I generally get a signal when outdoors
Using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me
Now the good news they do gets decent reception I tried them in my office in NYC which has a northern exposure and it got good reception
I too experienced the Blue Screen of Death on my laptop which has XP pro on it
I had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting
On another note the install of the router was GREAT regardless
I didnt gets anywhere with the Tech support group and had to return everything
After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow
Put in a new cartridge and it will working for a few photos and then the color turns funny again
Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos
This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it
I dont know why I kept trying as the purchase was made about a year ago
It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would hasn't cut my losses instead I did buying one more package of paper and ink
I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message turning the printer off turning it back on doing that several times and finally maybe getting it to printing two pictures in the same day
Now it says the cartridge should are replaced when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge
The ironic thing is the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful
But several tries to printing one more picture were a waste of about two hours
This is the last time I try to use the printer it is finally going in the trash
com brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer my motherinlaws
The resulting photograp was horrible it had a very green tint to it
I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer the green tint remained
I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual checkedcleaned the print heads and still the problem remained
Given that the product is still on the market I suspect I had a broken unit
I have only had the batteries for a short time but they are working great
I have recharged all three sets 4 per set three times each
thats what taks to ran my Canon PowerShotS2I2 cameraall good news
I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours
But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keeps me in the field for the day
I do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches
These batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet thats why I will is getting more
it says its an AV dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv
what a waste AV cables that sell for 20 are incredible
they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the av inputs of my tv
I was very disappointed when I received this to sees that it was simply a package of two cables
Cables that you can picking up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper
The Airport Express itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and going to your local Radio Shack for the miniRCA cable and a quick search online for the optical to mini
I dont like this mouse i brought and never worked its useles
Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product Ive ever used
I was stupid and used it on my primary display first instead of using the 5050 isopropyl alcoholwater mix thats far superior to klear screen products
My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not coming out
My 3 year old laptops display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 5050 solution on it my 2001fp looks horrible now
I am using two other PhilipsMagnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better
This one does not looks like the picture which looks more like the 425 model
It does not covering the equipment I have while the 425 model does Its learning mode is flaky and unreliable to says the least
Conclusion This would makes for a nice ornament It does looking nice and if you are lucky you may am not able to controls some devices
I bought this product to replaced a previous HP allinone printer I had
This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned
It does not like photo paper it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced
