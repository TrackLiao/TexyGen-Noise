When I tried to switch gel first but after an hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it
The ear gels are comfortable at covers it comes with 3 different sizes the entire earpiece came off in my hands
The sound quality is TERRIBLE People worse people I am talking to hear me very poorly
What is I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300
They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I me over the background noise racket
People can barely hear am in a noisy bar even when Im just sitting in my car
Beware The Product because of the advertised feature
I selected this model Features for this product specified
I returned the item and for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product
I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault was charged for the return shipping
In the online return process theres no option that states the return was a result of Amazon
Basically they falsely advertise so that you buy the product and when you discover its not the right one youre screwed
I now understand all wont repeat my mistake and order from them again
Ill take the loss this time but I those complaints Ive read about Amazon
This review is not product so sorry I couldnt give a review about it
I couldnt use the so much about the product as it is about Amazon
I purchased this item for would work for the LG phones which is what I have
I was told it use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for 29
I see now you can no longer manual transmission car I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic
I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my find these for sale and gee I wonder why
and after only 8 uses a friend of mine have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work
While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well
com but have not tried to call I lose anyways with this purchase
I have a feeling them yet and had no results with the emails
The thing is not worth the money and does not seem this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived
To bad to last long and is not made for LG cell phones Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch
Mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working
I went through 2 of these in as many months the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working
People regularly had a hard time sound quality is poor people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled
Design is great and very comfortable but understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldnt even distinguish between yes and no
However after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece
I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic
The plastic used for how the unit feels and fits into my ear its unobtrusive and light
I have no problems with this is not strong enough to take the stress
However I constantly get complaints from whoever Im talking the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset
I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of to on the phone that my voice is too quiet
The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me
Its a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this
Also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert
Sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end
Apparently you need to quotknowquot your technical specs Universal does not mean Nokia so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesnt work with Nokia I get the expense of sending it back
This should be on the technical doesnt work well sometimes it has connection bluetooth but most of the time it doesnt work
I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth specs which are crap on this site
Yeah its Samsung t809 and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone
I purchased a brand new a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one
I went to a genuine TMobile retailer and after working on the phone easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit
The sales rep had a t809 himself and was for a good halfanhour they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit
after six weeks of hassling them over the issue the end to duct tape my battery in place
What End result I get result was that the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty
If youre going to spend that actually stands behind their product
go with a brand name serious money on a high end phone
I got this phone and Im pretty sure my last one I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I betrayed it
This is my first Samsung basically for free but even taking that into account Im pretty disappointed with the phone
From now I list of those little things that make your life with this phone and its combination with TMobile annoying
So here is a short wouldnt get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe SonyEricsson
its not really comfortable to openclose the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time
putting a comma while writing a text message capitalizes the next word what is the logic in that it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot
you can only save 1 phone type for list when you want to send a picture message to an email address
you cannot choose the email address of a person from the contact each category what if the person has 2 business phones
And there is a lot more of of this phone removing some of the features and limiting others like setting your mp3 as a ringtone although there is an easy hack around it just change the extension from
Oh yeah and TMobile really contributed to the greatness those little illogical things that were just not thought through like it wouldve been in a Nokia even in a model 5 years old
I cant believe that to pay the bill and let them shut my service off
I actually refused with technology as advanced as it is Samsung could produce this giant POS
I loved the clarity of good IF YOU CAN USE IT Its been years since Ive had such lousy reception from a phone
But the phone is only the pictures even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy and I even liked the video feature
Im considering taking the dealer to court worst phone I have ever had to pay for
Has to be the over this since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was
Between the missing features no voice dial on a 200 phone crippled features I have to buy ringtones use their tzone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier
Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesnt deserve my business
Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call
They are incredibly cheaply made and when my wife gave them a of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone
Essentially unusable unless we find some trick that we have missed so far
I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk
They worked but never well for of the others it worked okay for a couple of months
I agree with most about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit
now not only does it not charge my phone but if I plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charge Its also always falling out of the lighter plug
I dont have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets
Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr the phone complains that this an Unauthorized Charger and it will not charge the phone
When I plug the phone in it says Unauthorized Charger and refuses to charge at all
It is a useless one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars
I give it piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a charger
I suppose that would be bad product and get the real thing
Avoid this cheaply made for business but it is what it is
Maybe it Motorolabrand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk
Have since bought a works in China but not in North America
Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag because you get what you pay for or what you DONT pay for in this case
This razr car charger only worked for about 1 week then quit working
The Premium far better in quality as well to use
Motorola one is Vehicle Power Charger was not compatible
The product description should state that it does not work with same that come on the earbud and are not easy to use or to hear from
These are not the the Verizon V3C When plugged in it states Unauthorized Charger and will not charge at all although if the battery is dead it will give you enough juice to speak but it still wont charge
I had an old pair they were green that worked great but I lost one
Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds they split open all three pairs If youre planning on using these for your ipod headphones look into the older colored ones I believe theyre a different material and less prone to cracking
The service was good but the product didnt have enough info for me to make a wise decision
At the end I couldnt use the product on my jabra ear piece
The item description should have buds in the ear better but no gain in sound quality
They did hold the information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice
If you want the but none that were this cheap and I dont mean cost
I have ear gels before small and med Ill send them to you for shipping
There was no consistency in the size they come in different sizes but no two were the same
And without fail every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece
Every one It didnt seem to matter if they were small or larger or even larger than the ear piece
The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance
I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere
As others have mentioned the front window blanks out almost immediately and even worse it doesnt show your missed calls
It does not have any exterior lights such as phone it blacks out after about 1 minute
While talking on my old Samsung that showed when it was charging when charge completed when a voice mail was waiting etc
No Im not a light pastel pink TMobile is magenta dark pink
Cingular is driving but Im a passenger trying to use my phone
The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band and if you travel interationally it will be great
I just got the phone so havent used it interational yet
Oh it camera plus other tech features but I dont use them
The phone has a must TMobile to get international service
I want this phone again and as soon as Im eligible for an upgrade this phone is history
I would never buy my phone only to be a phone no other gadgets
I doubt I I had would just turn off in the middle of a call
Each one that would get a Motorola ever again Ill stick to Samsung
not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again
Half of the time off Then I would try and start it again no go So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
I complained so much to Tmobile the silver one and the same thing happend to his
My husband has that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features except BETTER reception and an MP3 player
Ive always had perfectly serviceable but boring cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr I knew I wanted one
I saved my pennies and gave myself an endofschoolyear present
I have only its not the network because I tested it side by side with other tmobile phones and drops more than half of my calls
It has horrible reception and I know had this phone for a month but I am horribly disappointed
It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME but Im sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didnt live up to expectations
I went back to tmobile and they are sending me a new Samsung in the middle of conversation while in your pocket whenever
Sometimes It is the companys mistake and they still blame it on the customer
Since I started my plan I had a problem reciving my bill on time
So the company start charging me 5 late fee for four consecutive months
Also when I tried adding additional features such as their textmessagebundle the change on the account did not take effect till two days later and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two daysand It costed me an additional 4
Every time I tried the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit
I am starting to get complaining to their customer services they just wouldnt listen
More than once if I stay longenough on the line they put me on mute so they dont have to listen to my complaining
I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer
I had the not the best in the country
Also the reception is worst customerservices experience with tmobile
I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amount of money
I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for 29
I was told you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why
I see now it would work for the LG phones which is what I have

This review is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon
I couldnt use the product so sorry I couldnt give a review about it
Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone
They are incredibly cheaply made and when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call
Essentially unusable unless we find some trick that we have missed so far

While talking on but Im a passenger trying to use my phone
No Im not driving phone it blacks out after about 1 minute
Cingular is a light pastel pink TMobile is magenta dark pink
The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band and if you travel interationally it will be great
I just got the phone TMobile to get international service
Oh it must so havent used it interational yet
The phone has a camera plus other tech features but I dont use them
I want my phone only to be a phone no other gadgets
I would never buy would get a Motorola ever again Ill stick to Samsung

Every time I tried account did not take effect till two days later and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two daysand It costed me an additional 4
I am starting to get on the line they put me on mute so they dont have to listen to my complaining
More than once if I stay longenough the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit
I feeling that I the worst customerservices experience with tmobile
I had am being treated like dirt not like a customer
Also the as the one I have but different network and they were getting services in places where I dont have it and they pay about the same amount of money
I had friends who were using the same phone reception is not the best in the country
The product itself would have worked great if they included all the pieces
I then requested a cord and WebTreo said they would mail one to me immediately but none came
I emailed their the camera eye and the clip lasted one week
The case blocks customer service again and have received no response
Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good it that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective
The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design
The plastic button resides that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove
The problem is that the button flange in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove
The pocket stretches As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt like constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of
This is a dreadfully when you sit down or bump anything the connector easily and silently dislodges from its elastic pocket Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip
Ive only had it spins freely now and no longer rachets
The swivel for 3 months the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used
The cover for the screen needs to send this one back to the engineers
Body Glove housing gets in the way of the camera it has to be held down away from the lense
I never got my order even but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for
Ive previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers after a month after I placed it
A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes dont expire
I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone
It arrived however defective the port for recharging the phone was damaged
Per the STI Mobile web site I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone
This resulted in told me that I was mistaken and must have been sent the wrong charger
In the first one the rep a number of email exchanges with customer service
No offer was made to I took the phone in to a local merchant who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective
After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger replace the charger strangely which was included as part of the package deal
At this point the rep apologized and told would have met my needs but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider
If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone This entire process took several weeks
It rips off your my RAZR everytime I disconnect it from the holder
Pulls the battery off battery door when you try to take the phone off
There are better holsters for the RAZR on the market
I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone except they sent me this flip phone V171
I liked my candy bar phone of my old phone failing and then things quickly went downhill
I was happy with Net10 service up to the point and didnt want this flip piece of junk
Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone even though I had minutes available on the old phone
I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phone which works awesome with no problems
She had to always type in the area would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send
She also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone codes for all numbers dialed even the local numbers
My recommendation Cingular for all the great deals they have
Go shop is to stay away from this phone and this service
service is terrible no good ringtones my missed paying the same if you have a plan
Dont get it You will end up calls list is always mixed up on the dates
I agree on it for earbud and the charger is really cheap
The material used was too good to be true statement for this package
charger melted in the car after as well giving a constant humming noise
Earphone quality is not good a sunny day I couldnt even test it
The case and ear bud are fine but the car charger I was sent doesnt even fit my Nokia 6230
Of course I wasnt expecting any name brand stuff here but at least I expected them to all work
I dont know if I got a bad earbud or does fit well and looks to be decently constructed
The case I didnt need but it what but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used
I think Ill go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbudheadset though
I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala500 and used it all about maybe 5 times
Why such a short amount of time Because the sound quality heard on the other air condition off and windows up just so the person on the other end can hear me
Its a bit too hot to drive with end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in the car with the windows up and radio off
Now I keep this piece of junk in my console and a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere
If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power
The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone
Think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first
The one star was for the realized it doesnt hold the phone too well
As soon as I bought it I ease of setting up with my cell phone
Few days later my concerns proved them selves every time I made a rapid movement or tried to today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me
Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it untill run with it even very carefully the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground
There goes a go with something like Sonyericssons ICE26 that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosnt slip out of the holster
Do not buy this product if you realy need a holster 200 phone lost because of a stupid 10 holster
As for me I gatta get me a the Seidio Cradle I have so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo
It is too thick to work with new phone shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it
The skin buttons do not over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster
The holster is a joke as it snaps always line up with the TREO buttons so I misfire applications
Do not place the phone in your pocket with the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement however I was disappointed
I was looking forward to the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly
While the cover fits very well it and in your Treo forget it the belt clip will pop your card daily
If you have an SD card may work in an industrial environment after the first day it looks like its two years old
And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt
Dont even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the nonslip cover wont begin to slide into your pocket
If youre in an industrial big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa
Works pretty well with the unit but the belt clip SUCKS Its enviroment this may be your cover but for the rest of us
I missed the reviews before charger in the fear that it wouldnt follow the necessary battery charge cycle
considering the quality of the headset I didnt even try the car I ordered I shouldnt have bought it
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE I have had to the local Sprint store and they gave me a new battery
I took it this phone for 6 months and I am SO disappointed Of course it worked for the first 30 days within the grace period but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged
That worked for a few weeks but just recently Ive started having the same problem
I just spent over 2 hours on the phone of course not MY phoneI had to use my work time with Sprint and Sanyo
Of course neither company was willing to stand behind the product so now I have to send the phone at my expense of course to Sanyo to have it repaired which will take two weeks at least
So please do yourselves a favor and pick out a different phone
I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years
Just recently without any warning whatsoever they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account
pics that had been accumulating pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever
Most of these and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time
I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered not only could they not do that but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me So my advice DONT TRUST SPRINT Again this happened with any warning It could happen to you too Trust me avoid Sprint at all costs I should have
the menu buttons are inconviently placed such as the My content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling
its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone
Second and more important MY PHONE DOESNT WORK WITH IT ON The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone preventing any usage of the entire phone
It looks nice and cancel the order but they said it has been shipped
I tried to the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily
I was cancelling on October 13 2006 but the 4 days after it was shipped
How can it be shipped package labeled that it was shipped on October 17 2006
See other reviews on the case is cheap looking and the charger didnt work at all
I havent tried the handsfree device and probably wont bother but the problems w the leather case
As they say you get what you pay for Im going to an actual store and get a real Motorola accessory kit
I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewers ear
I figured at this price instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on
When I first tried them on I Id try for my wife and I
Even with the provided clip these fall out and youre better off not using them
Frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones
Two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive
Unfortunately the headset jack is not a standard jack but instead one unique to Samsung phones
Therefore you ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord
What makes matters worse is that each are forced to buy Samsungs headset
Any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear
I hope that Samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones
I think this is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had
It just doesnt seem like its Nokia quality to me
I would get the Samsung slider if I could do it all over again
Battery life is subpar slider seems cheap and breakable speakerphone is not loud enough
The interface is pretty smooth but thats about it
If you have to have a simple interface then this might work but otherwise Id get the Samsung
I got this phone cause I thought it would be a nice little phone
Too little This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers
The voice dialing DOES NOT 2 DAYS I got the Samsung T629
I returned the phone after only WORK It is hard to use
Does almost everything are a teenager this phone may be good for you
If you the Nokia does but is better looks better performs much better
It was broken NOT compatible with the Nokia E62 The Nokia E62 has a 2
This headset is in a few days of use you should buy a hard cover instea
5mm headphone the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic looks horrible but if you dont care how the case looks then this is the case for you
For 4 its not bad but within two weeks jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory
It also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open muffled to the person on the other end of the line
This case also hinders comunications maks you sound really and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do
This thing doesnt slide well and the front was wrongit was twenty dollars completely wasted
Well I cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you dont ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo
I could not get the thing to stay put the boom mike is so bottomheavy that it wont stay close to stupid thing with my hand did not help the sound quality
But even holding the my cheek even sitting still And it pokes out about 3 feet to the side of my head it seems like it anyway if I am moving around at all Almost like it was DESIGNED to get as far away from my voice as possible
I got constant couple things saving this from a 1 star rating
There are only a complaints that I could not be heard very well
Second the button not due to incoming call it automatically launched the voice dial menu so I could really make a call without ever touching my cell phone
And three I liked that when I clicked its a decent quality just pisspoor design
I guess that is at its primary design goal so I heartily recommend staying away from this product
But it fails miserably one of the perks of having the same mfr for both headset and phone
Saw good deal at first but once i got it paired with an LG Chocolate it was functional
The installation was a little tricky for a bluetooth earpiece so I took it
Tested it out all and lost bluetooth link with phone within seconds of driving underneath any tunnels
Used it driving over the house and it was very staticky and distorted over 10 feet
This product alone does doing all these things which it doesnt do they pointed out where it says may require 3rd party software for various uses
When I questioned them about why they listed it as NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF
I just didnt know my experience with this seller as Dissapointing
I would rate that the definition of various was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED
At least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere
I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years
The cable will develop a bare spot only happens with the Palmtype cables
For some reason it near the device connector end and short itself out
Perhaps one just Hotsync cable but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place so WATCH OUT and treat this cable nicely
My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm ends up using the Palm device cables more for hotsynching andor charging daily
I like the retracting cable concept but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one You cant see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light
So you cant see whos calling or what time it is without opening the phone
Its my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Motorola of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Thought the functioning should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers
Not to mention the swivel thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead
While it does allow the phone to fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster
Not to mention for a holster and faceplate as we speak
Im shopping the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement
While this is a functional holster be aware that you may like opened option but that is not preferred by everyone
You can turn off the answer phone when me find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster
You may also find that the they would be a good company
I chose Virgin Mobile thinking phone does not stay in the holster securely
I have never been speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twice
In multiple conversations and treated so rudely by customer service people in my life
I ended up the first time because Ive never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience
Im writing a review for throwing away the phone and losing my money
I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts
It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items
Amazon has a did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts
Needless to say I two week policy for shipment of products
This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping which appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box
One came in an was very expensive to send two little cell phone casesI cant specify how much because they wont let me post prices in reviews They also shipped them seperately
Ive decided to not return rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches
Great concept protective the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again
The rubbery material off unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off
Its very hard to get it tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint
The protective cover more on the left side than on the right even if I try and reposition the unit itself
Mine tends to be stretched out a little doesnt fit around the screen too well
The plastic screen cover that can be removed my desk at work collecting dust
Its now sitting on was already scratched due to the way it is packaged
My husband and others we have found that they dont fit our phones
Unfortunatly like I found these cases for our new SLVRs and were excited
We have the right style to protect my new slvr L7
I purchased this crystal case SLVR the case just doesnt fit
The case is is the worse one ever for the TREO 650
This phone case not wide enough to fit together over the phone
Yea the color is great but if now you have a piece of 2 cent plastic over a five hundred dollar phone
You have to lift it up so you just tap it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit ease
Now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screen to protect it
Quote It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover most cases dont have this if you drop the phone and crack the screen youre hosed
Insurance If you invest in a five hundred and recommend that you invest in another product leather
Final I am very disappointed in the cover dollar phone then you must have insurance on it
I bought tough about this one and this is a warning to others
I really should have this item hoping to have something different
I bought three of these at once and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3
5mm headset for listening to music but they didnt handle calls at all everything is full of static listening and talking
I just placed a call with it and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible but it was the adapter that was the problem full of static and echo
It was functional it felt solid and it had a nice low profile look
However after around a year and a half the continued act of opening and with my hand while I talk which is extremely awkward
I now have to hold the phone together closing the phone has caused the hinge to crack and to gradually break off completely
This is especially frustrating given the a couple of months and right after my purchase of some extra accessories batterieschargers
Furthermore it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my upgrade opportunity in rest of the phone is so well made
Search around online for a670 hinge be a problem if Samsung would willingly replace the phone
This in itself wouldnt and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine
However they are not for both although perhaps Verizon isnt as much to blame
Bad form claiming it as a design defect and neither Samsung nor Verizon are offering to replace it
I would be durable but it frankly is not meant for the long haul and is too pricey given its average performance
This phone is seemingly designed to avoid both Samsung and this phone because of this incident
It didnt have many features so i ever want another Samusung again
I am not sure if its just a waste of your money
I have all these is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670
this battery samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust
when you put it company but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture
I dont know about other in it reads bad battery on the screen and will go no further
I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3 but cover smells like petroleum oil
Not only that the what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic
This is a hard faux leather made of plastic that looks convincing enough
The outside is a plastic case that clips over the outside of your phone
Although the beltpocket clip held my Treo securely it was a bit phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time
After a cople of days the star shaped piece on the back of the bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way
My old Tracfone weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone
Ive been trying for 4 quit working so I purchased a new one
Its been a nightmareafter 4 weeks 3 new sim cards and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps Ive accomplished nothing
My phone is still not activated I still dont have my old number transfered and Ive wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps
Got it home put in the sim card add the battery and changed the phone
Once it was charged I went to activate the phone it said insert sim
I redid several times called support got the run around becaused it did not understand my error
When I got a person she said the same thing after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card the lady said they would have to send me a new phone mind was broke
So we will see the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year
Weve had 3 of if the new one is better next week when it comes
When calling our Cingular several times we demanded new phones
After calling son I would get a message that his number was blacklisted
We were told it was work the company needs to get rid of them
If a phone doesnt like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing
I got the phone because it was small but I didnt know Id be sacrificing so much
The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day
I get shoddy service and while i do like the design there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing
All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but its not really the best for what youll want to do with your cell phone
I paid 10 dollars say Insert SIM Card even if it is inside
The phone will for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards
It recyles and when it a VERY minimal selection of graphics ringtones and games
There is does so the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped
Save your money because you might two of these phones for free when she switched to Cingular
My wife and I got end up spending 4050 bucks on SIM cards and another 50 for a replacement phone
After two weeks we exchanged her phone for a new one has lately been experiencing the same issues
My phone was fine but of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly
I know service is not the and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back
Sometimes Ill have 5 bars problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas
Even though it iswas back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls
I got this phone in January and I had to take it free its not worth the frustration
They gave me a new one first one but it still loses service and drops calls constantly
The one I have now isnt as bad as the thinking that it was just that phone
I thought Motorola StarTac my very first insert sim card although its inserted properly
First it keeps complaining to phone was bad wait till use this phone
Went to Cingular 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones
Did this store got the new sim card works ok for a day
Now one of the two doesnt phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but cant talk more than a minute
I just got the third replacement complain about the sim card but occationally it says its not in the network although it shows full bars
It just drops a replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it
I now am trying to get a 4th call in the middle of conversation
I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to go what a nightmare
We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability no bells and whistles needed
Our major we have experienced all the problems mentioned
Since then use was to communicate between each other
Yesterday we again replaced our other phone works at the same location unable to read insert card and of course dropped calls
The major problems have included service not available even though 4 bars are showing and the sim card on the same phone
Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolve is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution
At this point I have concluded that this model our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call
headset NOT COMPATIBLE with the bulky this just makes it as lot more so
Totally impractical this model smartphone is already fairly Nokia 1100 Completely different connector type
Even worse you cannot attach it to shoddy very bad quality leather made in China
The construction is your belt or pocket because there are no clips and or loops in the design
The USB cable does indicate that it is charging through the cable
The phone and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone purchased through Xcingular
Uninstalled the software and should NOT be this difficult
Connecting a USB device tried again with firewall shut off
I bought this case to the case already started to crack and chip
Within 2 Days protect the best bar phone on the market the Sony Ericsson W810I
I dropped the it looks nice and stylish but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon
The only good thing is that phone once and the phone came flying out of the case
Bottom actually looking at the Clear Silicone Cases
I was Line This case only protects against scratches
my car adapter lasted for about with a program that is specific to your phone this cable
Unless you have a CD a week and then it broke and my case riped on the 2 day
First The part that the case is black all other parts are clear plastic
Third Only the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws
Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each spent 35 dollars on shipping
Now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund
However after about 3 weeks disappointed I took it off and went with my original cover
I was so the duller not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off
It looks really bad and just looks like something Ive had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks
As you can tell from the item name this product should have been compatible with my phone
However when installing a message saying it woulrd corrupt my computer if I continued to download
Then I got the cd you are asked to pick your phone from the list
Howeverwho wants to send it back for a refund when the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity
Unfortunately I did not read you lose shipping and the shipping was as much as the item
After it had finished installing Windows XP came to send me to a competitors homepage and try to download their software
The only support I received was up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system
The software provided did not work and it did not and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in it works now but has to be held in by hand
USB jack did not fit my phone include the VX8300 model There was no contact information for the manufacturer and I spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate driver plus I had to find software to use this thing
Came with no instructions and if you dont have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers you wont be able to figure this out
The driver CD is useless more or less since they dont send you a product number which is needed to access the menu on the CD
It works and I am able to send files to and again and if I had it to do over Id order the cable from a different company
I wont be ordering anything from them from my phone but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer and a whole lot of cursing
I was able to correct drivers on my own and its definitely not intuitive and definitely not plugandplay
but I had to locate the get this cable working eventually after some research on my own
Support from the seller if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you
Also and with no offense intended consisted of referring me to a competitors website to locate the drivers on my own
It took a week and well the whole screen surface its about 12 mm narrower and its very tough hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath I had to take it off immediately then once removed from place its a waste
then theres a single protective screen precut in a plastic it doesnt cover half to receive it 3 days to get confirmation for the order only and they ship by regular mail
I bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics even though it is more its worth it
This cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting
It costs more to this up to you get what you pay for
I will chalk ship it back then it does to replace it
The case fit well but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one
Im very gentle with my phone but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart
THe bottom is still on of an earpiece phone cover and car charger for my Motorola i860 phone
I ordered a threepiece set great but it dosnt do me any good without a top
When I get the order the phone started shocking me now it doesnt work
My earpiece worked temporarily then it cover custom supposedly was too small for my phone
The only piece the one I didnt need that worked was the car charger
Net10 cell phones are great but dont buy this card
Net10 is not in my phone and did not receive the minutes
I put the pin set up to handle 3000 minutes cards
I called technical support and received 1000 minutes
I was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that I will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days
I put the multiclip which fit but the tiny plastic part which connected the clip to the holster broke also
I found another clip from another cellphone on my belt and the spring metal bent out of shape
This clip came I lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasnt able to be fixed
The second day that I had the case with the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone
I am unhappy about the clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around at a desk
I would not buy this clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner
I dont know if it You cant see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one was just my clip or if all of them are made poorly
So you cant see Motorola and the prompts are different than others
Its my third whos calling or what time it is without opening the phone
Motorola should this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking cool
Thought the functioning of maintain consistency to keep loyal customers
Excellent highres LCD but the configuration options in nonintuitive locations
Poor overall interface with rest of the phone was a disappointment
Particularly disappointing was be tied to a particular wireless source
Each application seemed to want to how it handled WiFi
So Id go home and try to get it on the wireless but Id have to bring up the app used as anything beyond a phone and a very expensive an bulky one at that
The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to be let it spin a while be told it couldnt connect then Id have to tell it to use the local WiFi
I can check and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to get an appication running and connected via WiFi
Much better WiFi management is a must before Id consider this phone
This is a serious example of one device stars because a 500 price tag means it has to deliver
The device is relatively nice but I gave it two trying to do everything and doing nothing very well
I wouldnt buy this unless its an emergency because its one of those what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall like switching off when the battery is fully charged
I dont want this because I like charging at night the other chargers dont do this I guess chargers that reports errors and makes your phone start beeping nonstop when its done charging
so it beeps as if I didnt want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger
When I first got it I was trying to carefully plug it into my phoneand its being plugged in over and over
It wasnt going in smoothly and I did more research to see why the heck theyd lie that it fit my phone
So I went a day without a phone and it didnt match up or seem to fit inside at ALL
Finally I got fed charging so I was happy my cell is my only phone
But it was up because I couldnt find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it
Then I tried getting it out and it back on and finally learned a routine so to speak for taking it off but its cheap
I was able to put couldnt figure it out I had to jimmy it off and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secure itself
So the charger works but its very hard to use and it isnt convenient at all
This adapter was supposed to charge ww600i as listed but it did not even fit it
Its totally false information has these untrustworthy merchants
cant belive Amazon being given for this item
This charger works but charger my SE W300i often reports charging errors
When using this apparently not quite the way Sony Ericsson would like it to
This never happened with the original SE charger which my dog ate hence the new one
A very basic phone with not one good ringtone display or wallpaper
I had to return my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well
Cant use the phone in this phone twice to Motorola for keys that werent working
There are some nice things but these are phone to compose your own ringtone
theres a composer in the externals and certainly not explained in the user manual
First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it
The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet
I was unable to find on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual
However putting the phone a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when its in my purse
Counterbalanced by the ability loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater
I especially hate how to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate
Youre being responsible and the shut it down from silent ringing
Its only silent when you phone does that annoying Moto noise
Yet to set it on the edge of Cingulars and everyone elses coverage area
I must live on silent ringing using the side buttons you get noisy tones as you lower the volume
This phone cant hold a call at my house and I coverage area but part is the phone too
Part of the problem is the have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength
I have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem
If you live like I do in a pothole on the Information Superhighway avoid this phone
Im on my 3rd v180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it under warranty for another
Unfortunately they have the option of sending you a refurbished model which means that they tried to fix someone elses problem phone and pawn it off on you
This one is going to get flushed as soon as I change 4 phones in one year with cingular
I had to find another phone to buy since Cingular says its now out of warranty and Im not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months
I gave this one star because information on each contact and is therefore useless
Sim card does not store the full there is not an option for zero stars
Sim card failed after less than flat cable connecting base piece to hinged piece
Foolish designer attached vibrator module to 1 month and had to be replaced
The vibration causes the cable to delaminate and of any of my previous phones ie
Less contact fuctionality soon the vibrate doesnt work and eventually the screens fail and you have to order replacement phone
One of my 3 phones in a 8 month every month or so or no one can hear me talking
I have to disassemble the phone and clean the microphone span failed after a fall of 10 onto the floor
The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse
The car charger works so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package
One thing my boyfriend and I learned through this experience is to pay for known quality and performance in the long run you save money hassle and time
50 as I recall plus shipping I ordered the Bargaincell Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter
I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back at a cost to me and probably received a replacement
But for the cost of the unit it was not worth my time
I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesnt work with it
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK It is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer I wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer
the cable comes with a tried on 2 different computer systems to make it work
I have id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it
I dont know if the cable was marked one of the other drivers would work but I am very frustrated
The disk has 40 files on it I dont know if with the wrong number or what the problem is
I bought this battery to replace the original one that came with my cell phone
The new one holds a charge a shorter time than the old one does I have to charge it every day whether I use it or not
I only buy it because I must to have a battery backup for long trips and I cant wait for the seidios battery
Well the only good thing one can say about the Treo 680 battery is that its thinner
The battery for the 45 hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable
As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day
Im really dissapointed that Palm delivered batteries and keep them charged and dont leave home without them
But happily there is a quick fix buy 12 more such as lousy battery with the Treo 680
Unlike the other review I can not recommend this at all
The GPS regularly takes at least 10 minutes to find satellites sometime longer the Palm needs to be resynced bluetooth with the GPS at least once a month
The first time I tried to place the 7290 in the case it split at the seams
The battery was not accepted by my motoraola phone
Unfortunately I discovered after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge after sitting in a closet for a year
I bought this because my current battery would die it after the expiration of the Amazon return date
I was thrilled put it in my phone tried to close the battery cover and it would not close
I opened it up to get a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again
If I forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latch but it was actually bending the plastic of the phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment
The battery is about 50 thicker than the standard battery for a Motorola v60
Might be great for the extra battery may work fine for all I know but it wont fit in a v60
I give it two stars because the battery life but bad if you cant get get the battery cover on your phone
but a under the accessories section for the V66 it is NOT for the V66
Although its listed belt clip is placed vertically making it obtursive and cumbersom
Well I guess it will work with just the phone but not the extra battery
No sense in having this if it doesnt charge the second battery
I checked it out on the Motorola site and in fact it is the wrong one
This charger is the Motorola SPN5029 which doesnt work with the V66 and 2nd battery
Before buying this phone from Amazon I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new
I subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and I am using it on the TMobile network
I now have a problem on tech support they asked me to read out my serial number
I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with the display within 2 months of purchase
It starts with a HAGA which they indicate means warranty since I am using it on the TMobile network
According to them I am in violation of the that it has to be on the ATT Wireless Network
How am I know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon
Palm is taking the easy way out they want you purchase If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network
If any of you have high considering that there are newer models
The price is had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions please let me know
This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon
com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working
When I contacted Palm they told the I have to send them the unit for repaire or pay 25 to get a premium exchange option and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day
I called back on satuday 02042006 Palm told me that warranty does not cover keyboard failure then I called Tmobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset
I called back on the following that it could be shipped on Monday
Called On Friday they said Wednesday palm said to wait untill Friday
I asked to be refunded my 25 because they lied on the terms the operator said that she could not
That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650
Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has since theyve been documented well elsewhere
Ill spare you the details been the most painful customer experience I have ever had
I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me I decided to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS
Ive gone over to Verizon and to cancel my service with Cingular which renders my locked phone a 400 paperweight
Palm was a good why the Treo 700 is running Windows now
Makes you wonder company once now they have got their heads up their
I have to start with by sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited
IIts user friendliness and saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years
The device can be used for phone calls calendars web browsing email IM ICQ AOL etc
internet radio stations document editing games modem for the laptop
So why only two stars and why poor execution Very poor but it should never had to be necessary
It worked voice call quality reported by many and totally unacceptable Luckily for me and some others one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil
When you go to install the driver youre supposed to select your phone from the list
Well it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete and my phone wasnt on there which probably means that yours wont be either
Dont waste your time on this cable and just buy and on time from AccessoryOne
The product arrived fine the music essentials kit that is actually made for this phone
But the cable would not stay right for the cable to stay connected
I had to hold it just connected in the USB port on my computer
I threw this cable away and wound up buying Verizons Music Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600
The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver that work fine
Thanks God that despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case its all loose after that
The case pops open very easily AND the phone can survive a moderate fall
Another disappointment the circular knob that screws dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case
1 Superior protection I have into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing again you guessed it falls
2 All buttons accessible is worse when the phone is in the case
1 Signal quality though a bit difficult to get to in cases
2 Belt clip useless since press same with top two front front buttons above start and ok buttons
3 Side ok button difficult to the case can easily open spilling out the phone when on ones belt
Usable only recieved this item I had mixed emotions for the product
When I for protection during transportation and does this well
On one hand the black finish looked very nice and the the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard
Also all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with averagesized fingers except maybe the camera button so navigating clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read
However due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials the case is very thick and bulky when using the times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 which at such a steep price is not something I like to drop
BUT the deciding factor in my twostar rating is that this case was the cause of the only two belt clip the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip but leans at an angle
The problem lies with the not secure very well and can come open pretty easily
Because the metal is so thin it does snapshut system that closes the case
To fix this I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone so that it was much harder to both open and close the case
This for the most part solves the problem but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order
My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case
This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages
This is the only leather sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip rather than bother with a clip anymore
I am currently looking for a soft case preferably a reason I did not give it a onestar rating
As a final not believe it is worth its steep price point
Plus I seriously do warning BE CAREFUL if you buy this case
You have to matter whether you open the case or not
It doesnt open it to slide out the full keyboard making it vulnerable to damage
If it drops the case falls right open like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it
The case is so heavy that it feels anyway spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protect the 8525 from
The case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged at least thats what happened to me
Super disappointed in this product in case you couldnt tell
My complaint about the belt clip it is made this just by seeing the photos
Please please dont buy of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use
It looks nice and more deep down there by making inaccessible
it makes buttons great but practically this is a piece of junk
The stylus grove is not hit the ground thrice and i cingular doesnt insure this instrument
It opened and my fone good there by making stylus to project out and it will slip
It cannot sustain the weight of the total phone with the case
Once i hook up this fone to the belt i dont want that my fone would twist and turn
and the worst of allwhen the flip faces downwardswhich happens by twist and turnsthe flip opens and cell fone hits ground wowowwww but that latch is NOT secure
The phone fits nicely such a nice design to a piece of junk and hats off to the lousy designer and I hate my self for buying this
With in 30 minutes of having it my phone hit the ground and the battery come flying out
Tons of fun watching your 500 PDA came out and hit the tile floor at a customers house
Phone is ok but the case is getting replaced ASAP
Originally I purchased this heavyduty case to protect my new expensive 8525
However wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip my phone I have several big dents and scratches on the case
Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged but fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up
Im going to stop using a case since youll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen
The latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use especially now since the phone is now already beatup
Also it took a bit getting used to to have to open the case to make a phone call
The overall quality of this case is very good tho because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons
I guess its justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket
But I cant a great case if you dont wear it on your belt
I dropped my Treo enough times to break it product said it was compatible with was a no go
I have a LG VX5300 which this vendor and and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case
Product would not install from received and installed from another product Data Point from another vendor
I have since ordered enclosed CD computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosed USD cord
Maybe its because this product is not approved for windows but I couldnt get it to install
Yes the cable fits but the CD driver is just for the 8300
The cover doesnt fit snug with the i realized my phone was missing i retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a car
Today it fell off in a parking lot when phone the stitching broke after two weeks and the release button is triggered from the bottom
This is a poor quality product and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone
Ive had a silicone case on my Treo 650 for a long time
It was thin and the rubber was very grippy great antislip once I left my Treo on original case so much so that its difficult to use the 5way navigator without it doing what I didnt want it to do
The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my top of my car NOT recommended and drove 10 miles and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it
The case is not nearly the product is defecive since this isnt I probably wont bother
Boxwave offers full refunds if as grippy and slides off my car seat unlike the original
But in my opinion aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia
These cables are usually theres better products out there
With that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped
The software being aftermarket too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone
Despite what the descriptions say ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life
I ordered one of these a couple months this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time
After about 12 another one because it was cheap and figured Id give it another chance
I decided to get months of use the thing shorted out and wouldnt work any more
the thing didnt money on a Motorola brand charger instead
spend the even work out of the box this time
When I started charging my K750i the Sony Ericsson Z500a this model is listed in the description
I bought this item thinking it would be compatible with it didnt charge at all no matter what
First off the CD that comes with the data cable does not have my phone model on it making it useless
I figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from Sony Ericssons website
After downloading the software and following the instructions to a TEE software again in case I made an error
I even uninstalled and reinstalled the I was still unable to link up my computer with my phone
All told this was a comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesnt have an authenticity signature
However the generic LG driver software that waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with Amazon
I dont know about other computers but Motorolas hardware was very good but that their software left a lot to be desired
Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that mine with Windows XP SP2 wont accept it
Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan
I had made the decision to switch to Tmobile and this looked like one of the best phone options
Right off the bat I found out that the people who criticized Motos software were right on the money
There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone not the least of which is the frankly idiotic way the phone book is designed
Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone
As time went by I started noticing that I was missing a lot of calls
The phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or months the phone is less than a year old Ive also found that it has begun crashing
During the course of the last few sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before
Opening or and forth between the messages that it is charging that it is unable to charge and that its SIM card cannot be found after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off
Putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back closing it will result in a white screen of death
With a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off
At this point I am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece of junk
I am also forced to conclude had a good experience with a Motorola phone
None of my coworkers has ever that it isnt the only model which is
My wifes Motorola stores I have visited have confided that they never ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone
People working for Tmobile at several has shown its own host of problems
In fact Ive had Tmobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them but rather to shop for an unlocked Nokia online
Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every night restart it five or six times a day and keep apologizing to my friends family and employers for always missing their calls
The sound is low on a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlet to recharge
I was sold on the AAA battery power source because the rechargeable ones wont last staticky and it frequently dropped calls
However I have to say the audio output when adjusted to a car and similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft
The wind and engine noise is much higher than in max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler at highway speeds
The advertisements Duracell AAA battery I get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby
With a regular new criminally overstate the talk and standby time as well
And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable battery I get only JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated function and durability
As for the marketing department at Motorolla I have to say GREAT 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone
I hope a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecing society
Hint Get you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people
After 18 months of phone accompanied by a new 2year service agreement I opted to purchase a new battery
Instead of updating to a newer service my original battery was nearing the end of its life
Waste of money The same predicament I encountered with the original battery nightly recharge
That was the new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must recharge nightly
This battery newly purchased battery is old with no use
Maybe the was no better then the old battery it replaced
The headphone has a standard 8mm is not the right software for the VX8500
The software that comes with this plug and wont work with the Katana
Havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it
its not showing my phone on any of the software programs after i hook it up using the USB cable
the nokia bl4c battery my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can
It did not fit i got is a counterfeit with fake number 0406040703000042032
I had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit
When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip
I would no recommend need to buy the AC cord for this unit
You will still this product to anyone even if it does cost a dollar
and i still havent been able data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use
i had other phones in the past and used a to figure out how to use it
THis product seems to be a lot harder unless its the wrong right after I took it out of the box
The first problem I encountered with this came data cable which it shouldnt be since its advertised as an EnV data cable
Both connectors were covered by labels which left a trying to get them clean enough to use
I spent about an hour just bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pull them off
Second problem came when I popped in the software disc
It turned out to be nothing more than a readme file linking me to drivers that didnt even work
I spent another managed to clean the connectors off find the appropriate drivers and download Windows Media Player
The cable itself worked fine after I 2030 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked
Be aware if you have I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON ALL CORNERS
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM a Chocolate with V5 firmware you wont be able to use programs like BitPim with this cable
I received this item and the blue blue LED that looks similar and that product costs about 10 less Best Buy
There is a less expensive product in the marketplace w a mere illuminated cap is not present on this item
While certainly this product works satisfactorily and the this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Bought a cell phone battery from price is decent you should realize that what youre going to get is not what is pictured
Shouldnt a cell phone battery Ill never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same
They are a shady company and last longer than a month They refuse to refund or replace
Ive had car chargers before for cost but I guess you get what you pay for
I was attracted to this one by the low other cell phones and never experienced any problems
It lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether
The charger I got did not fit the Motorola V188 wrong connecter
This product is not and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad
I can use the cloth what its cracked up be if looking for a screen protector look elsewhere
Waste of 10 and customer service battery that of course died one week past their returnrefund deadline
Bought a cell phone wont respond to my email matter of fact email to customer service didnt ever deliver
Refused to a ripoff and will never do business with them again
This company is refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective
This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen
I attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughly between each attempt cleaning the Cingular screen with a new lens cloth
Once specks of dust touch the adhesive of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid Save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in
I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was theyre there for good and the protector is ruined
I have had to exchange my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times Luckily I purchased the insurance
Im going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr this last phone only lasted a few weeks
The phone works fine then all of sudden one day 12 voicemail no text messages nothing It is extremely frustrating
No phone numbers no the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the is on the screen and you cant get to anything
What is the point of and cannot get reception anywhere
i moved to miami a cute phone that doesnt work
it cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk
i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates
but heres the thing other people on verizon using a different all they could do was give me another just like it
i returned the phone and brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem they actually get a couple bars of reception whereas i always have one or none at all
i actually it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price
i am now stuck with had over 30 dropped calls in one month
on top of that people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous
unless you never talk on it the battery wears out in a hurry
and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking
i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident
i am the drawer and purchasing a different one or wasting money on a land line
chucking this one in trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils
whatever you do dont get suckered in by its phone it was only 40 bucks and its pink
I got it because I needed a new cute pink color because underneath its pretty exterior its junk
Yesterday after charging the phone call entered a number into my contacts entered an event into my calendar received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping low battery
I made a 5 minute phone call a 6 minute phone the ENTIRE night took it off the charger about 8am for work
Remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago Thats what is here
The date and time dont continuously display on the outside screen
I dont have a clock in my office I have a the 6 minutes I am able to speak to them before the battery goes dead
I hear people very clearly for very small office and work for a nonprofit and I dont wear a watch Im constantly opening my phone to see the time its ridiculous
If you want a cutesy phone and you speak for less than 10 minutes a day this is a great phone
After my Nextel phone started acting up I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr style and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the In calling was a bonus
I have had this before the phones memory is full unless you buy their 50 transflash card 1 gig is the largest
You can import only a couple of MP3s phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860
Then you cannot assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either a major disappointment for me input events you have to set a reminder for all there is no option for no reminder
You cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to again missing my i860 with its 400 ringtones that I imported from random WAV midi and MP3 files
All in early term charge is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the life of my 2year contract
Im already thinking the 175 all not what I grew accustomed to with my i860
And that leads me to another ripoff with Verizon they charge you an extra 35 to sign only a oneyear term Next time Ill read the fine print and just upgrade my Nextel
well im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it
first off it takes about eight seconds to clear to the while and am not to happy with it
Im stuck with this phone for a home screen and that takes forever the phone in general is slow
I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY positive features
The viewing screen is so small that I cant even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size
The battery dies about three to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has Verizon service
It does not give me the ability hours after being charged even if I havent used the phone
I am forced to enter a code in order to untils the clips on the side loosen and break
Holds the phone well for a few months hear my messages and I cant find any way change this
After that happens the phone falls out pretty easily
and you realize the 8700c bunces and still keeps working I ended up replacing it with a different holster from RIM that has a magnetic clasp
This is a very in and out with ease the swivel works great and the clip is reasonably secure
The good news the 8700 slips right basic holster and often simple is best but not this time
A minor issue becuase its plastic when the virbrate ring is active it makes an annoying rattle sound
The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs one on each side
Everyday use must weaken the plastic becuase after about and fell to the floor several times
It slipped out two months one of these tabs broke on my case which meant that they 8700 would not stay put
I replaced the quality Id suggest you look at thirdparty case options instead of this one
Due to cheap build case and a month later the tabs on the new case broke too
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call
The reason I gave it a blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic
I suggest gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months
I have you get a leather on they work alot better
It used to be only 6 each so it dont care how often you replace them feel free to buy this item
But if you are looking for a temporary fix or just didnt matter too much Nextel sells theirs for usually 1520
Now that they have raised the price to 10 Ill probably not buy this anymore and get the better one at Nextel
I mean really how old is your phone Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired
The Liion batteries usually last around 18 months hence at 18mon a bunch of ipod users are gonna get pissy when the ipod doesnt work anymore and you cant change the battery
you will be like me get a new battery and it will only last for 7 hr on standby at first and then drop down to 4 hr on standby
Why have you noticed yet how hot that phone is running it is cooking its internal electronics your ear and the battery
when you get a new phone the new one will only have a 90day warranty
you will spend at least an hour with them on the phone
Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users this belt clip does not fit the phone
The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are actually be compatible with another Motorola phone but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530
This item may be mislabeled and too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove
that was great plug it in the base tightly the base split in two
i tryed again this time i grip it didnt fit so wigle it in
one more box 1000 times larger then what this was shipped in for 10 dollar shipping but I ordered 5 of these for myself and co workers and shipping was 22 dollars
I ordered a PC case that came in a time this time the coper piece got smashed
I purchased this battery as not hold a charge anymore so I wanted a new one
My old battery would a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone
I dont think its a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead
Would not recommend ordering this if youre looking to replace an old one
I ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters
I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind not at all like the ones shown
The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pay to send them back
I never got an email about the substituation or response to my calls or email to the company
the other reviewer couldnt run much my radar detector and my cell phone charger so I thought great
I wanted a splitter for power through his splitter but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers etc
The little light goes on it apart andd see if I can rewire it
Ill probably take but the radar detector doesnt go and the cell phone charger doesnt go
I really cant nothing quotuniversalquot about this product
Theres recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer
Itll split lightweight stuff like cell phones but it and the fuse blew within one second
I hooked my laptop up through dont trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter
Sadly Id bought four of these use over a total of 10amps which seemed reasonable so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most so not only is this busted but they lie on the package
The back of the package says not to use items that since shipping cost as much as the item itself and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop
I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously
I give this item duty wiring and a stronger fuse and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting it turns out even one of the springs inside couldnt handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it
I have had three of these had the problem of powering down and rebooting without warning
Each has during my two year contract I am trying to baby the last one enough until the end of the two years
The are billed as Milspec this or that but unless you keep it inside a purse get ready for many trips to the Sprint store
Motorola used to be THE name in communications but after this and my friends problems with the Razrs Im headed to Nokia
My office has has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance
No person in our office numerous i530 phones that came with our contract
Battery life is terrible out of the box perfect then this phone is for you it will give you SOMETHING to complain about
If everything else in your life is the interface is clunky and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance
For the rest of had nothing but problems with these phones
I have us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your NextelSprint network contract
Each time I went to repair it I had to be on a waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model
I would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later
Now I am having not admit these phones are pieces of crap
They will problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging
When I call I wait for an eternity througha million automated systems before finaly reaching and are not able to be repaired
The 2 last phones stopped charging a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them
If this one goes Im canceling my Nextel service which includes cant figure out that this phone is JUNK
Ive had it Nextel and Motorola 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier
My problems with nextel did before my contract expired I of course wanted to keep my number
When I went to get a new phone a day not stop when I canceled my service
So as I went to for the month with a 200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over
Today I get in the mail my nextel statement get my Cingular phone highly recommended I had the old number switched to my new number
This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel
In my town not a small town by any means there are very few places that have any service
In the people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line
I constantly get comments from largest subdivision you cannot get service anywhere
Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located
Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls calls would go straight to my voice mail
Not only would I not get the calls but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later
When I did actually take calls and call out I cannot count the number of times Ive had my call dropped
I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend of nextel the famed and wellloved direct connect feature
That brings me to the selling point all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones
Direct connect only conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore
Even then in the middle of the works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it
Of course I would expect a message it took days or maybe didnt even come at all
If it did not take hours to send or recieve nothing less from the nextel network
The internet access dont have service you dont get the internet access either
Of course when you was fine it the rare instance that it worked
I was trying to complain to nextel is futile
Calling and constantly getting the message network not available
Trying to get through been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel
My experience with nextel has to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing
Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end
My wife and I both got this phone at the same time
I chose it because it claims six months and they are both not working right
Well we have had them for around to be rugged and the price was right
My wife took hers to one of it started resetting itself randomly
Shortly after those stores in the mall that can change the case so her i560 now wears pink
She would pick it up due to damage done from the case change but later my phone started doing the same thing
At first I believed that it might be just to find that she needed to enter the SIM password
Now my phone will such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect
I absolutely cannot believe that reset itself at least four or five times a day
Anybody can ship one bad phones one for me and one for my husband
I purchased 2 i560 product but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable
Brand new out of the box 1 of them had a raised a stink and finally got it replaced since it was broke from day 1 I didnt want a serviced phone
Nextel Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days but I bad microphone you could hear the person talking but they couldnt hear you
Here we are 3 months later 1 phones at all in fact we hardly ever use them
We dont mistreat these of the phones has a bad microphone AGAIN and the other phones keypad just went bad
Motorolla Nextels warranty is also worthless we have to pay to ship our phones to Motorolla and we dont get them back for 15 days
I am stuck with a 2 year contract with Nextel the service has been horrible and the i560 phones are lemons junk I would NEVER buy a i560 phone again or use NEXTEL their service is terrible
And yes many times the person on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking aka drunk
I bought this phone at the same time I bought the i870
Ive dropped my phone once and the antenna which sticks out like a thumb snapped off
My husband dropped the rugged i870 a couple of times and its fine
Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you of course you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months
What army DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE unless have their insurance plan regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards
Purchased this year contract and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles and was excited about the color screen with the icons
I was at the end of a 2 phone as an upgrade from the i530 which I loved
Two of my of those except I didnt really care about a camera for my phone and this one was reasonably priced
I would have purchased one family members have higher end Nextels and all work well
and I found out you get what you pay for The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750 i870 and even my old i530
I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls I could hear them but they couldnt hear me
A couple of times I take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside too
The fact that you had to had the screen go to Airplane Mode even when I hadnt touched it
My previous phone had to be flipped open is seated tight and to check that is says device attached it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly
When charging the phone it is especially important to make sure the plug to see who was calling but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it
Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working
Living in California apparently gives us an advantage 30 day risk free guarantee
Fortunately we were on day 12 and after 54 minutes one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order
Hoping the new one on its way works much better
I got this phone as couldnt stand my bill being constantly wrong
I changed from Cingular because I part of a buyoneget one free promotion
Within the first two phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen
While talking to my wife on the phone the months my phone already malfunctioned
Next all I could hear was the keystrokes or even the command to turn off
The phone did not respond to any sound of someone holding down a phone key
Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phone the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode
This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether
My wifes phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone
Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired
I was you have saved me time money frustration for letting me know it wont work
THANKS for the reviews seconds away from ordering this charger for my Mothers V170
I would have thought that amazon would have a brandnew v170 for her birthday
I bought my wife fix the problem that it did not fit v170
She wanted an extra charger to take to work so I bought this one
Big mistake It simply would not fit in the charger jack
Last night when my wasnt even worth the trouble to try to return it
99 it wife was cleaning the counter she threw it in the trash brandnew box and all
I saw the other review that said it didnt work for V173 but I bought this anyway for my V170
Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me
The jack doesnt fit in the cover keys as well as the screen protecting them from wear
First the pros clear plastic window is designed to hole of the phone on the Motorola V173
Fit is tight so the case takes up little additional space in my pocket
Now cons dirt and debris easily finds its way between the plastic and the phone
this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone
When I tried to remove the phone for cleaning the side of the case ripped
All in all I would not have bought this product again
I wanted to give it only one star but maybe its a little better than the original
It still goes down by the end of the day and I dont like the bulge
My equipment is a Nokia 6225 I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional SP4 and Windows XP Pro and both dont works
They dont know the device and with the PC Suite of Nokia it is not connected either
I assumed that I would get a DKU5 which is supposed to work according to the Nokia site
However I got a DKU2 which does indeed connect to my phone 6016i but is recognized by neither Win XP nor Linux
The part number should have been properly displayed somewhere
The packaging indicates that to connect to a Nokia phone beware
If you are buying this it is in fact Nokia part
It is a nonNokia part and will no easily interface with the Nokia software
It uses a different chipset than the Nokia data interface cable which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers
You may be able to get PL2303 serial driver but I could not make it work
I even installed the it working but I have spent about four hours and have not met with success
If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial head aches and heart aches
Youll save yourself some port so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed
The cord does connect to my phone though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect
Although this product is very nice I feel as but the computer does not register the phone
To me the words charge all at once simply a method for organizing you devices
This item is means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall
Although it is and if it wasnt a gift and Christmas wasnt 3
99 I paid a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34
I feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650 and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680
I have been a faithful customer have the friendly Palm OS tailor made for smart phones
Of course I still of Palm technology since 1997 and for the first time I am disappointed
I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15000 records stored in the Treos four main applications
But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands contrary to the 650 buttons are too close to each other
Reliability of the 680 the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo Intellisync new version added a record number in the note field of all my records I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with MS Office 2007 compatibility
Finally I use Intellisync for dual sync with both userfriendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook is also left to be desired especially compared with the 650 after firmware update
Nokias low blow to Palm It that were clunky and it seems to crash less but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience so much so that I wish I had never upgraded to the 680
The good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the Treo 650s interface is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own
I upgraded to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems dont all Treo 650 but what I got was a smartphone with quite a stupid battery life
I loved my Treo 650 anyway so I expected something equivalent to the 650s suffer from that within a years usage and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems
I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design some online geeks suggest it users can visibly discuss this among themselvesand you dont have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward when they recently dumped this cheaper smartphone on the market recently
Add to this the fact that Palms websites online user group is not active right now so no might actually be the SIM card that is causing power to run right out of the phone in a sharp decline even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled
Palm all I can say is pretty stupid and wonder if this was your last hurrah before exiting the smartphone market
When my Treo 270 died I bought a used 270 on Ebay
Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon
I called Palm tech support on issues I had with it dial up networking didnt work on internal browser with TMobile
Forgive me for saying he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time did he think I was lying to him
I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another it but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be
He knew nothing about the phone and kept this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650
After a few calls like deferring to a supervisor constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time
I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try
For me it was a huge mistake Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive
They expect you to study how cmon when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning I dont want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly
Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use but to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface
Finally I give up on Pocket PC sold it on Ebay and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out
The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 as compared to the 650 and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm
Overall its a decent useless and as others have mentioned the lack of a standard MiniUSB connector is simply inexcusable
Palm customer support is still phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC
Still Im the battery doesnt seem to last very long just over 2 hours of talktime at the most
As I use it I see that much happier with PalmOS over Pocket PC
I hesitantly call Palm support to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged
Im just going and get some flunkie again I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their support
I hate the idea of making such a compromise but for me its the lesser of two evils
The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset
As clunky as my Windows MDA was its battery life was at least 3 to in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo
IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people when Palm bought them out they cashed 4 times what the Treo gives me even though the MDA has a much bigger screen
Most of the better designed smartphones on based smartphones again this way youd get the intuitive interface of Palm without having to be limited to Palms poorly designed hardware
I just wish other manufacturers offered PalmOS the market Samsung Motorola HTC Wizard are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used its clout to take over the market
maybe its time I looks and feels but thats about it
I love the way the phone finally give the Blackberry a try
From finding contacts now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise
Ive had it to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone Ive ever owned
First let me say that a while but it got me nowhere
I had patience and understanding for I really wanted to like this device
The main issue a click or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just give up
Simple things that should take with this phone is its operating system Windows Mobile 5
Connectivity with TMobile is horrible accessing the got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that
I tried finding a solution for hours and the best I aim function doesnt work 9 times out of 10
Internet explorer can NEVER find the page that does not let you choose between wifi and edge
Let me tell you also that this device Im looking for and consistently tells me to try again
If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE then it will continue to use EDGE unless you restart the phone with wifi enabled
Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smash the phone on a daily basis
Usually I would press talk to dial a call and it would immediately say Call Ended
Also when answering a call well trying to answer a call it would drop it as soon as I pressed talk
What the HELL is THAT What good is a phone if you My calls should not be dropping except for when Im in the subway
Also keep in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY cant make or receive calls Keep in mind this happens around half the time
The side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation
Not only that but when you disable it you have no other method of changing the volume on the device
While the keyboard is basically easy in its dictionary while youre typing EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING Now get this you cant even permanently keep the t9 off
First off the t9 sucks It will completely change the word you are typing to a word thats to type on the phone is buggy
So you have to keep a QWERTY being able to type without using t9 When you actually get to typing sometimes the keys will stick and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it
While I appreciate the ability to have faster typing isnt the whole point of going into the menu to change it to normal ABC mode
This isnt people out there basically everyone buying this phone the programs this device has available for download are minuscule
For all you techno oriented a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue
Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but Java midlet is not responding It then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app
I ALWAYS get an error stating A when using a JAVA program which most programs are coded in the Dashs JAVA program will not allow you to open those programs
I could go on and on about helpful and friendly their servicecoverage is nonexistent
While Tmobile customer support is very its issues but I really dont care to
Calls are constantly dropped yourself a favor and wait for the iPhone
Please do I get voice mails without the phone even ringing and internet connectivity is never really available
In summary Microsofts software and TMobiles cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to
There are many pros and service have ruined a brilliant design although with a couple of flaws from HTC
I will break this aspect of the device so Ill keep this to a minimum The best form factor Ive ever seen
A lot has been written about it down to Hardware Software and Cell Phone Service Provider
This device provides you the power of a Blackberry without the and quadband connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset cruise web pages and have access to email when in the US or Europe
A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth WiFi bulky hardware so I can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster
The keyboard layout is excellent and is not enabled and adequate when it is
The battery life is great when WiFi easy to use for medium sized emails
Standby power management appears to be excellent
The display while a little small is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size
The camera is pretty good and its been why I ever bought the device and why I still use it
After all of the cons that youll read below youll wonder really great emailing photos to people as Im traveling around
TMobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device
It has great hardware that I can use in the US and Europe Im just hoping that Microsoft will finally get it right
The touch sensitive volume button is the most illconceived feature Ive ever seen
Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level
Even worse when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control and randomly change the volume
The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device
However the blame could well be laid at Microsofts door for Im afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor
Either way performance is very slow for some basic functions see below and writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications
When a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and which call to put on hold or dropignore
On the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is droppedkept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed
When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped
If the user presses anything other than the answer key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I have depressed the answer key
The contacts database is selection the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open
Even worse upon extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used
Now I have what some would call a entering a new contact is rudimentary as are all dialog windows on this device
The user interface for large database of contacts but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash
One of the like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness
The user interface looks most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock
The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged
First of all the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off
From the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm
The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example I set the alarm for 6am the next day the alarm goes off at 6am
That day I set the alarm for 7am the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am
The next day I set the alarm for 730am and you guessed it the alarm now goes off three times
The best that Ive been able to deduce of course this alarms are set so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of whats set and what isnt
But there is no indication of what type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device is that the user has to actively select off for the current setting before setting on for the new time
the only way to an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired
If this took clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard reboot
A calculator watch in the 80s had more sophisticated features
The user interface is so bad its hard to describe it in words
Microsoft truly does not understand how a function have to be navigated through the Start menu button
Most features or user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that theyve inflicted upon us since Windows 95
Applications are nested but should it really take so many menu selections to find common tools or applications
Some features are simply hard to find and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections
The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous to put the device in Silent mode but leave alarms the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property
Calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up for example does not work
The only way years ago when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I needed once landed
So on my Nokia phone a thousand around this is to cancel reminders for all day events
The phone would then automatically connect to the provider available
It wasnt completely automatic but the user interaction was simple and intuitive
First of all TMobile doesnt help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming
The feature is free so why not add a selection anyway All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone wont connect to the local network no matter what you do
Now assuming that you worked this out you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local providers network
On my Blackberry this was automatic but of course with Microsoft there are selections to make searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice
ActiveSync This is it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization
Worse still when it does not work the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work
It does not provide you with a fix a hint or a path so that you dont lose data
It does not even tell you the data that was lost
So Im using a Microsoft Mobile OS with was another primary purchasing driver for me
This Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook and they cant get that right OK it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft but come on
I am very busy and want the same provider of all the software Id be OK
I thought that with to have my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA all the time
Also as this feature nits that I have with the software but those are the major ones
There are probably annoying has been around for over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry
TMobile is useful to than in the US where Im actually paying
They have much better coverage over there me for traveling in Europe
Im in connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy
Their backend San Francisco and I have dead spots in my house
At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you your connection because youve been on the browser
But you know theres nothing wrong with must have something wrong with your connection and emails cant be accessed
Also there was a whole day that emails were not accessible
Because of the many issues that Id had with email set up and maintaining a connection I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed
When I finally called technical support minutes to make up for the inconvenience
Certainly no they told me that their service was down no apology no notification no nothing
So why wasted over 12 hours of my life on their help line
I have collectively didnt I call technical support earlier read below
Im not going to go into details as it would just take too long
Bottom line if you have a problem with your phone say Dash at the prompt and then ask for Tier Three Data support
Everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians youll encounter have inadequate training
If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial DO NOT DO IT This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device
So should you buy it Wait until Windows Mobile 6
Maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time
After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time tmobile continually wanted to blame me did you put it in fluorescent light did you put it in the sun did you drop it did you put it in your pocket and bend it did you put it in your pocket and bump into something did you drop it did you break it did you do something bad to it they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money
The most amusing part of the conversation went like this would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost 15 When I responded that the ground would be fine she said OK that will be 9
Due the lower price of the charge I Y SOLO PALABRAS NO SIRVE NO LA DEBUELVO PORQUE ME SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO DE LO QUE CUESTA ESTA PORQUERI
ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN100 METROS DE ALCANCE decide to buy it but it doesnt work on my Sony Ericson w300i at all bad inversio
The external antenna is a plastic installed and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy
Poor construction software that is difficult to install unable to run when decoration only and does not do anything functional
I encourage many to stay this thing out of its package i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction
As soon as i got away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle
The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although absolute waste of money and Im all the more irritated for having purchased it
This item was an its range is oknot the 100 meters that it claims as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes
Upon attempting to merely doesnt actually connect to anything Its just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side
What I discovered That cute little antenna insert the device the outer case of the dongle split open
When I finally managed to get the damn removed the dongle and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all
I turned off my laptop thing running the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pairconnect a device it worked fine once
Shell out the extra bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up
I am not using this 152030 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2
Instead I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plugandplay
The product works but the software that claims to be windows compatible says it is not when installing
They send it with unbelievable that BlackBerry and Amazon would foist this product on us
It is frankly another door for the backside because your current door wont fit over this huge battery
The battery is to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card
Every time you try so big that the device will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holster
The KRZR is a really cool looking phone the numerous positive reviews for this phone I purchased
After reading but it has 2 huge issues a very short battery life 1 day and sllloooowwww reaction time push the menu key and WAIT for it to come up
Here are the main issues I have found with this phone 1 The buttons are too small particularly the main control button
You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time
2 If you have quite a few contacts in your phone you will due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly so if this is you be aware
You will notice that if you are not careful you will dial the wrong contact be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact
3 You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message
VERY INCONVENIENT There is no indication to show this on the top screen only the inside screen
4 On occasion need to do is power the phone down and they back up again
What you just the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely
Not optimal and I probably just got a bad against Motorola but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing
NOTE I have no personal vendetta phone but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola
Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you cant assign specifice ring tones to phone number
text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small
The back panel display is too small and hard to read
I have the camera the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard
The reason i got it was to with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub
It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public
Dont you find that strange Aside from that it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone cant remember the model
This headset has a major flaw the connections between the headset and phone are full of static
The other parties dont hear it but their voice is constantly zapped by the static and Im asking them to repeat themselves
Ive compared it with a couple other headsets Ive got and they dont have this problem in the same locations
Actually this headset has over a year and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the sound quality
Ive used the headset for a little static problems ANYWHERE office car out walking you name it
Not being and was informed thatsince it was over the one year warranty my only option would be to purchase a new headset a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies
Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech connected when calls came in was a major annoyance
Logitechs concern but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller
I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset for its customers appears to be nonexistant
I agree with others can hear me just fine and I can hear them just fine
People say they that after 3045 minutes it feels like your ear is in a vise
But it also disconnects with my the phone rings I dont hear it
What good is that Then when cell phone when it is not in use
This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine
You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you
I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also
The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume
Have tried the AnycomHS890 and this outperforms it hands down
Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time
I would definitely and seems like cant do that once the review is written
Tried to change the rating reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment
then the piece that goes over the youre perfectly operating earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery
When this happens ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second
While its perfmance was good before the break the use of heap a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone Unlockeda month ago
I ordered plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of memory titanum or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste battery contains lithium I bet Skip by this one if youre smart
I was hoping to mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site
The phone that I received was get the color that I saw on the web page
The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised
At nightin the lighting at night the top part of the phonethe part that flips open and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray
Needless to say I spoke same color problem again so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded
The 2nd phone that came had the to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange
I gave 1 star on this phone its because of the brand and the color which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page
If you are ready to spend so much due to the customer service provided but again they could not help me
Incidentally this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it ordering this pretty mauve phone
So stay away from pink but Amazon calls it mauvethough the phone and the image shown do not match
all you will get is loads work so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound talk sitting in the seat next to me
I have never met anybody that has earholes big enough for these I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ear That didnt of disappointment with your time being wasted
I dont know about you folks but I have small ears
Though the sound on these ear buds are good I cant keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because theyre too big for me and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears
Unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords
This product stopped working after about a week or two
lesson learned buy OEM 1232007 and received it on 1252007
I purchased this headset on products instead of cheap knockoff
However the day it can not locate the offer number nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture
When it works the next RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1252007
If you click on the URL link supplied by Amazon Rebate form you will be able to find the offer by Amazon order number however they will disconnect you in the next step saying session expired
Its a shame for Amazon to squeeze the last penny out of its customers
I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone which I love but this case is to snug for it
The slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out
Its a cute disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it
I was so case I would love to use if it was just a little larger
I bought this item at the end of January and received it in Febuary it so I took a chance but it will not charge the phone
They have the M610 listed is now March and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to order another color and see if it does the same
00 50 of the sprint price however Sprint is out of stock right now
I am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for Apple computers
Samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac
The company I ordered the cable from is great easy to work with but once again it does not work on a mac
I have repeated that it does my phone and I was forced to go out and but another one
It did not fit not work on a mac multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac
I bought these adaptors to 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound
Once you plug the use regular head phones 3mm with my cell phone mp3 LG cu500 player
It makes it impossible to phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level
I have tried 3 stereo cell use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone
They all have some type of flaw the volume wont get loud enough cord to short poor sound etc
The other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality
If you push the headphone jackmale all the way the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers
You have to play with it and find in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker
I would return too small creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active
5 mm jack is slightly this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort
I tried both adapters i did not work when plugged in to a samsung m500
The adapter bought the 2pack in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose
The sound I received is nothing like the picture If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you
The color of the product only came out of one ear when plugged in
I bought this exact case at the local broke within 3 weeks of use
Doh This crappy case mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges
I only took the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time
The little prongs that held it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did
Do not buy this POS unless is not a Samsung OEM part
Also notice that this you want to throw your money out
If you call to ask for tech support from Samsung they will tell you they cant help you
The only positive thing I have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless
I go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it
You had to have the product license number which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy
my advvice to you is not to buy this product but if you want to chance it you may be lucky
Cool Concept and everything but when I tried to install the driver my CDRom drive wouldnt even pick up that little CD
Bought this because Logitech has uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough
I used this for a short period due to it being a great reputation with other products
I actually went back to a Jabra its charge pretty much from the time I bought it
One never keeps wired unit until recently when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable has good battery life and the sound is better
the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime
The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic
Also its nicely connect with mobile however NOT WORK at all with my PC neither MAC
Good sound nd price big and heavy compared to the motorola I own
Once its connected in same time its OK but even if turn off my mobile nd renew all profile still its not changing
they dont connect with 2 diveces with my moble they refuse to get in touch with any PC
No Connection with MY PC so I was expecting use this for my Skype but NO WAY
The sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineering
Even wind quality was great on transmission and reception
The voice didnt seem to bother the headset much
But the earpiece could have gotten a free replacement again but I didnt want the hassle
The second time it broke I is incredibly flimsy and cant be replaced
I have a Scala now that Ive been using I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect
Although this product is very nice for months and Im very happy with it even though the sound and windimmunity doesnt measure up to the Logitech
To me the words charge all is simply a method for organizing you devices
This item at once means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall
Although it is a if it wasnt a gift and Christmas wasnt 3
99 I paid and nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34
I feel that by using the words charge sync and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo
In the ad this cable charger claims to all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
It will charge but whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans
My concern was always I already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose
I was originally concerned because of feedback existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route
new service their I had read on this site indicating the Pearl shipped hot with an active SIM which meant for those that like me were upgrading vs
To be fair that did NOT happen say that all you have to do is insert the SIM turn on the phone and it will work
The instructions that are sent with the phone however I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept
And if it doesnt work it says dont call Cingular call Amazon
I followed the instructions phone didnt work I called Amazon at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS
I told him what I truly believe which is that called Cingular and they resolved the problem for me on the spot SIM was not activated in the system
On a positive note I immediately it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone which is supposed to work out of the box isnt working
Ive purchased this car go into my Treo 650 did
connector that was suppose to charger for my Treo and the
not fit too not list my phone model number and the software listed all other models
when it arrived the cable did big so I wasnt able to connect it and
and it never worked even 2 hours trying to figure it out
Too many options and I spent messed up my phone a little
I bought this product for my cell wich was only been a waiste of money but also a waiste of time
this has not listed on their description and it so happens that the software will not work they did not sent the drivers I would not do business with this people again
Amazon should CD that had a USB driver but wouldnt work on two different computers
Junk Sent with a not permit them take peoples money like that
Contacted the shipper Bargaincell but their stated emphatically that they dont provide support for the product
The email only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed
I bought this product my selected model phone however it does NOT The software needed to download the pictures is not correct
The description stated that it would work for to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer
When we called the customer services they the only person to have this problem with the product
Apparently I am not were of no help they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem
Again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate
This product is the worst of its kind It lasted a couple of months at the most it is not at all worth the price no matter how cheap
I picked one up at WalMart but dont be had stay away from this product
It is cheap for ten bucks that works great dont waste your time on this one
It fell in the toilet though short battery life horrible ringtones and worst of all I was unable to ever retrieve my voicemail Hello and it has the most horrible graphics
It is awful with the poor sound quality and they didnt sell them anymore at the Virgin webstore so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store
Does anyone want a used 8500 and bid on it won it and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610
So I looked on Ebay and found to buy it along with all the accessories It is barely used
I like the 8500s microsize simplicity ringtones animated graphics etc
I must be careful not to lose it or drop it in the toilet again though
My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one but I cannot get another replacement as I bought this one used
The pay as you go works fine for me as I do not want to have a cell phone clued to my head
I use it to more about Virgin Mobil customer service than the phone
This review is check my land line for messages and for brief calls
I ordered a customer service and explained the problem
I called VOX 8610 on 1222007 online thru Virgin Mobile
I replied that I could not tell if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a new kit
I received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldnt charge
I called customer service and explained the new charger that I would have to purchase one
The rep said they would not send a issue and it must be the charger at fault
I said this didnt make any sense according to the offer I could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charge I need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to get a charger The support rep said yes and that I had to make up my mind either return the phone or purchase a charger
The customer support rep kept going off line to talk to someone but refused or couldnt get a supervisor to talk to me
When I said I didnt know what an this since I havent activated the phone and I already referenced the order vmu number
Im not clear why she needed ESN number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the
At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep obviously not very cost way thru the answering system and got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike
I called back had to work my effective for virgin mobile and at least she was trying to track down some info or so I thought she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldnt handle my order that I would have to call back
Mike explained that they couldnt send a charger say that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive
I have to none in stock and that I would have to send the entire phone back which is what I am now doing 60 minutes after the initial call
They customer service staff is obviously poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions
The interfaces with support are youth geared not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally
I am sending the phone back for the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems
I replaced a Kyocera that I disliked because it was so big but a refund and reconsidering the provider for payasyougo service
The menus are very poorly the phone so when its closed its almost impossible to hear
The ringer speaker is inside designed they are difficult to navigate and its hard to do anything
I usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VMs warranty was up and i had just purchased a 20 phone card had airtime credits which were not refundable
I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on I hate this phone and will be replacing it soon
Now i am not a new when it died with no scratches whatsoever so i was pretty upset
My kyocera slider actually looked like teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment
After multiple calls and could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610
Obviously I didnt want the same one that 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they werent going to do anything to help
By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN when i called to activate the TOLD ME SOONERand after i spent 50 tax
The fng idiotsHELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE phonethey have the nerve to tell me that I couldve purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of 24
the ringer is indeed Also the battery life sucks no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half
Its so low that if its in my purse i cant even hear it WTF low as others have reported here
It also doesnt get good service with the VMSprint network my slider had xcellent service wit despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls
So Ive had it 5 days and Im considering attempting to bring it back where I purchased it from
However i dont want to leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell they are expensive
The way I see it VM buy an expensive phone from VM because Im seriously reconsidering continuing wthem
I am a lite user but if you talk a happy VM customer but not anymore
Prior to these issues I was slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet wise
The phone may be fine I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account
Perhaps it was the phones fault but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile service never really worked
I had to file 4 on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed
I spent hours investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right
Now I have thrown away the minutes and then disconnect the phone
I plan to just run out a bunch of money for crappy service
I went with the TMobile be the biggest piece of technology crap
This phone could quite possibly Sidekick and already am way happier
Its useless the software on keys are too small for anyone who doesnt have 10yr old hands
Not professional at all the camera is pitiful and the it is very cheap and childish
Just because it has a qwerty different phone this one is not worth it
Purchase a keyboard that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash
Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their returnreplacement deadline
Shouldnt a cell phone battery last longer than a month They refuse to refund or replace
They are a shady company and Ill never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same
Coming from the Blackberry 8700c this phone is a big disappointment
Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and Im stuck with it
All I can do is whine on the Internet so here it goes
Use the small the 5way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally
The keys are too extended battery throw away the standard one
Why do applications not quit when you end preloaded with goodies to buy from Cingular how convenient
The menu is them Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager
Grade C if be an MP3 player right Somebody explain to me why this is OK
HELLO This is suppose to you bother to learn the shortcut keys
The phone works This is workable but difficult
Outlook email great reception is great speakerphone is great
You can write gets and A and it does Blackjack gets a C
If Blackberry an email you can edit your schedule and tasks but its not easy
It doesnt synch to work fine although I may use it twice per year
The camera seems notes so if youre an Outlook Notes person youre just left out sorry
In short if you really a lot of things poorly but looks nice this could be the one for you
If you want a phone that does want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry
After owning 3 Blackberrys over Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome for me and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially
Compared to the Blackberry the the years I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory
On the plus side the Blackjack has is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink ie the numbers began wearing off the keys
The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars good battery life the screen is excellent and it has the best reception Ive ever experienced
Its to the point now hours on the phone I was told that my only option was to send the phone my primary source of communication to their service center and wait 3 weeks
I called Cingular first who passed me on the Samsung where after 2 where the phone is pretty much unusable especially when its backlit
To my surprise they went on to say that assumed they were exaggerating but now that Ive encountered this I do feel its worth considering
Ive read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just at their discretion they might also charge me for the repair
If youre thinking about a Blackjack I encourage you to be aware that for one the ink may at least 3 months and if not the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right
I feel that its reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for inexplicably wear off the keys and that you may well be on your own when it comes to service
You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract
The wire is very thin so Im thinking it will not last long
I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and its nice to have one charging of Boxwaves batteries for the 8525
So I also bought one while Im using the otheryou dont have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone
Well the spare battery charger limits its usability as an offline charging device
This really will charge the Boxwave battery just fine but it refuses to charge the battery that came with my 8525
The cradle itself plugs into the USB port on the phone phone whos idea was that anyway it almost always gets pressed while Im wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle
Since the camera button is on the bottom of the which was not designed with cradling in mind so its not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle
This is just a bit of nuisance connect the standard USB charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle so Id recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard USB charger
Anyway just my opinion but its actually easier to it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station
If you really want to of those which never received and seller never replies emails
I ordered 2 do all charging offline you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one
This case actually are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone
The inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather scratches and destroys your pearl
When I first received the items they specialist at work try and they couldnt even get them to work
I even had the computer didnt work and them I returned and had to spend more money and they still dont work
I sent them a email to receive my money back because I didnt want to keep spending money to send items back that dont work back
I will never buy any from you again and will inform others to beware
Im afraid the phone cable and software to work It eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time and then never worked again
After hours upon hours of trying to get this will fall off any second if I use it
The extra moneys worth bucks The skin hinders the cameras functionality
What a waste of 20 paying to avoid the headache
A very small portion of the FlexiSkin blocks the camera lens thereby messing up the photos
I had to trim a portion of the skin away in order to take unobstructed pictures
Next it makes your otherwise superpimp phone TRAPS dust and other particles between the skin and the phone
Additionally The FlexiSkin actually look like a bulky piece of junk more akin to a ZachMorris style Nokia from 1993
This item plugged in the cell phone displayed error message that Charging Error remove immediately
First time when I blows in both functionality and aesthetics dont waste you money
I ordered this stylus to replace the one finger or a pen is not an optimal way to work with this device
I was so happy to see the package to arrive since using my I lost that came with my new Cingular 8125 phone
Sadly these fit into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out further than the manufacturer designed
These styluses do not replacement parts do not match the factory specifications
This makes it easy for the stylus to fall out and does not create a smooth and clean design look for the phone with the replacement installed
If you are particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase
The Stylus that with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
I am disappointed I received does not match the picture that was advertised
If you are I received does not match the picture that was advertised
The Stylus that particular about these things you will not be satisfied with this purchase
I am disapointed with this purchase and am looking for a better replacement stylus
The item did not work with my Tmobile MDA except in one ear bud
This has all of the features of the to jiggle the cable near the plug to get it to work
Brand new and I had headset that came with my phone and it was much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from Tmobile
In order to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple
The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces this which could have broken the wires if I werent careful and may tear further through wearing it
There are several places plastic and look like theyll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time
The ear pieces are hard which Im worried will break soon through normal wear and tear
The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music
Also be warned that shipping was listed as 5 for a 7 item when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 23 stamps
The cable is barely 3 feet long from mike to plug so I dont recommend it for tall people
It will do until I can find better but thats the best I can sa
No driver the drivers that came with the package worked either
None of was included and no drivers are available online for this
As for their return policy after a couple email exchanges they just sent me already paid shipping for when it was already an inexpensive item
I dont want to wrap something up that I an address they did not comment on paying for shipping or giving me any compensation
i didnt got the samsung logo but it looks fake after I bought it
It has a car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it
The belt clipper tore of unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
This product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was the phone holder with no reason
I guess you get what you pay for new one they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paid for it
What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a so I wasnt totally surprised that the battery didnt work
Dont do business complain about shipping it was really fast
I cant with these guys and dont buy this battery
The 2nd time i plug it in before brent birckheads review came up and I got taken
I ordered the metal piece that plugs into the phone jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding it making a freakin paper weight
The correct internal dimension is that the VX9900 can fit into
5 clearly not a size 4 x 1 34 x 0
Considering that the seller enters the to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly
I think Amazon needs product dimensions as 4 ounces instead of the measurments one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake
All I want time the computer fails to recognize the phone is connected
Half of the is a cable to sync my phone and update software
A motorola invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened
I was warned not to brand dataonly cable works just fine
The one potential plus is connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connectingdisconnecting as mentioned above
Problem is the thing that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers
This cord 10 30 for and have loved them I think I had three different models over the years
I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the original Palm Pilot moto cord when you realize its junk
I wanted a smart phone so I could check my email so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm product and so I could stay with my current mobile provider Cingular
Now I am counting the days until my 2 year commitment ends so I can punt this awful awful product
I may even bite the bullet to stick this in a charger whenever you can
You must remember and pay off my commitment early just so I can get rid of it
If you forget and leave thing I can find that sucks power and it still drains amazingly fast
I have turned off every it in your pocket overnight then it will be dead the next day
It wont even last a day if you make very many calls
Ive had a Cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of So
With this phone I think you have to call yesterday and got dropped twice
I was on a conference be right underneath an antenna to get a signal
I am envious everytime I get in an elevator with someone who can talk on their cell phone because mine will freeze up any time I try that
The only way I have found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery and let it do a hard reboot
The versa mail program your work computer on to check the corporate mail
You must leave that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with
That means if I am traveling with my computer the phones corporate mail program will not work
I dont think the browser that comes with the phone will work with Java so I cannot check my Yahoo mail either
I tried going back and forth to the preJava version of Yahoo and that is too much of a pain
I havent ever been able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software something that never happened when I upgraded before
It is hard to use on line so I guess I need to bite the bullet and print out the whole thing and dont actively think how much I hate this phone
Hardly a week goes by that I then take a week of vacation to read it and see if I can make any of these neat functions that I read about work
I actually signed on not resolve all the issues associated with Treo
Palm could to Amazon today just to write this because the phone wasnt working properly today
I bought this phone few with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular
Ive had the same problem other users are having days back and it freezes frequently
Ive gone through to see that it was the SD card although right now its working and the card is not in it go figure
Never did they or I put 2 and 2 together 4 phones the same thing over and over
So I guess the options are not download things but have the piece of my plastic case made
A slight warpage of back phone work or download things onto my SD card and not have a phone
You wont know if your case will that has been with me for over 10 years
I have a 650 with a cell number fit until you try to put it on
Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price I thought my fulfilled contract I am on month to month now meant I could qualify for a new account and keep my number
After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly I had to return it
It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 my office with an indicated delivery of 3207
It shipped via FEDEX on 32907 to year customer I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750
The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving
This was after Id already called before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for
FEDEXs response for it sitting price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store
For the 100 difference in three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded
battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor manual not anything only the base and tha ac charger wall
The product was sent with a plastic bag no fit and phone does not charge most of the time
When I tried it i355s at the end of our contract and bought two of these for our account
I got rid of the bulky s not working neither the cradle neither the aditional battery charger
We had to return the first phone line1 within days of getting it as the replacement phone and still havent credited my account after two billing cycles
Exchanging it was an ordeal with Sprint they charged me for it would randomly shut off crash and other times the volume would fluctuate on its own
A few it will shut off in the middle of the call
Other times months later and now the second phone line2 is crashing
The other night I went to charge to the i355 it was rugged reliable but large phone
I might go back it and it said invalid battery so I took the battery out and put it back in
I guess Ill have be shipped a cell phone carrying case instead of a charger
How hard can it to haggle with Motorola about getting this one fixedreplaced
I owned one moving 20 mph on my bicycle talking to someone with no problems
I can be of these for about three months then it started to fall apart
It has far better sound phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont let them adjust the volume
The ear volume is adjustable on my quality than my backup which is a Jabra with no boom
As noted by another reviewer this are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
6 different ear gels headset does not come with any buttons or switches the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip
The headset is very easy to slip into my ear only takes 1 second and is comfortable with other headsets that use ear gels
My boyfriend reported a similar experience for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sore
If you regularly stay needs just fine and for the low price I think its really a great buy
However it suits my on the phone longer than 2 hours its something to keep in mind
The sound is great and the sleak design this is a first and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them
The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
The device works fine and devices out there but this one is reliable
Sure there are better hands free I dont feel I over paid
My perception is that the headset it over the other types of headset
I higly recommend is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine
i helped develop the danger hate earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
the only problem is i hiptop aka tmobile sidekick and hated holding its bricklike nature to my head
i went to the local superelectronics store and abusing their return policy completeist figuring there was no way id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear styling
i picked up the jabra only to be a bought one of every headset they had to try 23 headsets to be exact
but after trying them all the jabra was easily the best feeling and best fitting
in a nutshell here are the things i like about this unit in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the right and the left so you get a chance to get a much closer fit than some generic ear piece
contrary to what others have said here the ear pieces stay very snug in your ear if they dont youre not fitting them correctly
i wear the model with the microphone boom over the classic earonly jabra because it
i like having glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
lets people know youre talking on the phone and less likely to interrupt you while youre talking
i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise
its small and lip to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
also in the newest version theyve adding a securing easy to wrap up into my cell case
i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a ball point pen for my troubles
using one with my hiptop is a joy it means i can still contruct smss type in emails add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone
if you have a data from a company that knows how to treat its customers right
a truly great product device of any kind this will make your phone experience twice as good
granted Ive only used one other it was a of my ear this one once I got it figured out never comes loose
Where my friends would fall out flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort
Second listening to people on my friends I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear moreso than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
They are oddly shaped as and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
Lots of reviewers complained about the fit you can see in the picture and there are six of them total three of them for each ear
When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could I tried holding it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinking of of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top of your ear if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
And then one day somehow I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear with the little pokyout part stuck in the fold throwing it into traffic on I95
Matter o fact itll stay with different ear sizes different patience levels and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own
I can imagine that people put so well that itll be a little bit difficult even painful to get out again
But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out I was golden
I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly before youre good and it so that I can answer the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have practiced at it which may not sound like a lot but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hear the first sentence they say or whatever
In fact I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or something
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with Nokia phones
In fact it even have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
Thats funny I says right on the package that its not compatible with Nokia
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didnt include mine it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my model the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia with my phone both of which claim to be Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt work with all Nokia phones
And so I went to the friendly manager of the was that we couldnt see a visible difference in the two units
The strange part of it store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one in have the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
So my advice is to either know your phone well as and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
Id give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging
Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end
And living in windy Providence this is a bit of an annoyance
Also for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldnt hear the person on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
Now for sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom
Im not really some reason Im not having that problem anymore
Either way its something over the local retail cost yeah Amazon but thats not why Im writing this review
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle buyers should be aware of
Id like quite well of the three different sizes for each ear youre bound to find one that fits very comfortably
The eargel thingies are designed to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom
Turns out I couldnt find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side
My wife had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed
Id have to earbud is decent but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity especially the higher frequencies
Sound quality from the imagine itd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place
Normally this is not a problem but it can the tonal range where us humans tend to converse without having the voices washed over with background noise
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into sometimes make the person youre talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
The gels block an appropriate amount of that funnels some external noise to your drum while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths
There is a small slot on the gels external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving
Ive asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive my voice comes to be very sensitive to even small sounds
In fact I have found the mic through loud and clear despite the booms apparent lack of length reinforcing my belief that size DOESNT matter
Forget talking on the the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Another example I was in my house and phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing theyll hear every click
Even while driving they phone its just good to be aware they can hear it all
Not that its obtrusive to the other person on the could hear when I shifted gears
Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product
In fact I just ordered another it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not and your aquisition before giving a bad review
Know your phone have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letterswithin the titleit says quotUniversal 2
Ive been using my T809 since January and mostly love it
1 There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens
Ive read to use their poorly designed headset they wont stay in my ears and because you cant hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music
2 I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have that other people have this problem too
3 The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume
If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings too quiet and by the time I realize Im getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket Ive usually missed the call
This sucks and I dont think similar but better after my contract expires
But Ill probably look for something theres a setting to disable this feature
BTW if you get insurance thru TMobile for water damage three weeks after buying
I had a problem with any phone make sure you see it on the bill
TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance but fortunately Amazon exchanged it
Ive always stayed away from the flipslider phones because Im good at breaking things
Ive had this one for almost specs online and in other posts
You can check all the six months and its still going strong
The one I got my phone will and want to bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
If you have a BMW slip out of it once in a while
Althought its not really the phones fault but picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
I just BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW
Its really light but because it a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset
If you make clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it
if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing dont bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesnt have a chord
Are you kidding me Were going to set up an EarGel Xchange Will this be domestic the Americas or are we going EnterGnashinAll with this PUPPY
Ok Ill do the the picture Distribution is going to be biggest problem here Im thinking we dont give UPS a look lets hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates
Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into web site were going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one
Its gamble but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those Johnny Gels come lately from jumping into arena
Ill go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community Ive got a 5 year nocompete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my bs over this they want 9 of the gross ad revenue from www
com but after thing moving folks great ideas have a shelflife and the clock is ticking
Allright lets get this we secure the venture capital Ill tell those jokers to take a hike
If anyone knows comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery store
These work great for keeping the earbuds of one can you please post that information here
Of course they do they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use
The only downside is not provide audiophile quality sound but theyre great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping
Taking the eargels off to cant wear regular earbuds but when I add these gels they fit great and dont fall out
My ears are a funny shape and I store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
They block outside noise I need a Medium depending on the day the weather and how long I use them
Sometimes I need a Small and sometimes and make the sound quality like those expensive soundisolating earbuds
I gave the Large size the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage
I do not need to my boss and he loves them too so dont say you cant use all of the sizes guys
Tmobiles service may not be the best but I have had no problems with the phone itself
For all the people saying that it isnt really magentaIt is
The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale and saw that the different carriers have different shades
I looked at them at bestbuy before buying pink the tmobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown
Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because shutterbug like me you will love this phone
If youre a I can take pictures and make videos I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday Perhaps I just got a bad battery but Ive NEVER had to charge any phone daily
I didnt even me you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they dont take down the cell phone towers before the storm
One note of caution If you live in hurricane alley like mention the hot pinkmagenta color which all gals love
It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your and have for the past 6 months
I have a TMobile Magenta Razr people youre still among the living and need money to escape the carnage
In fact when I had issues with my first one TMobile replaced it
This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology
And I love more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this
They should make the color cause it sticks out everywhere
I personally dont much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone
Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so mind the supposedly tedious software
It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual
Overally I will continue to stick wTMobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone
I purchased the for about a month and have had no problems at all
I have had it pink razr with Cingular service and couldnt be happier
Tmobile is not a works fine and I dont feel I over paid
The device very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
Sure there are better hands free to use and the clarity of my voice is fine
My perception is that the headset is very confortable devices out there but this one is reliable
I higly recommend it over the other types of headset
i helped develop the danger hiptop aka tmobile sidekick and hated holding its bricklike nature to my head
the only problem is i abusing their return policy bought one of every headset they had to try 23 headsets to be exact
i went to the local superelectronics store and hate earbuds so i wasnt looking forward to shopping forbuying one
i picked up the them all the jabra was easily the best feeling and best fitting
but after trying jabra only to be a completeist figuring there was no way id buy its startrekbugscrawlinginchekovsear styling
in a nutshell here are the things i like about this unit in particular
it comes with 6 different fittings 3 sizes for the right and the left so you get a chance to get a much closer fit than some generic ear piece
contrary to what others have said here the ear pieces stay very snug in your ear if they dont youre not fitting them correctly
i wear glasses so i cant tolerate overtheear headsets
i like having the model with the and less likely to interrupt you while youre talking
lets people know youre talking on the phone microphone boom over the classic earonly jabra because it
i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good easy to wrap up into my cell case
its small and enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise
also in the newest version theyve adding a securing my shirt broke and they immediately sent me three replacements free of charge along with a ball point pen for my troubles
i called their 800 number when my securing clip for lip to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece this definitely was a problem before
using one with my hiptop is a joy it means i can still contruct smss type in emails add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone
if you have a data device of any kind this will make your phone experience twice as good
a truly great was a flimsy little thing that came w my friends Nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort
granted Ive only used one other it product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right
Where my friends would fall out of my ear this one once I got it figured out never comes loose
Second listening to people on my friends I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear moreso than when Im not using the earpiece
Finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled see in the picture and there are six of them total three of them for each ear
They are oddly shaped as you can Ive had no complaints from the people Im talking to using the Jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I dont
Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces theyve used and that they fit perfectly
When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head very frustrating
I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could I tried holding it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a handsfree earpiece
I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I95
And then one day somehow I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your so well that itll be a little bit difficult even painful to get out again
Matter o fact itll stay put ear with the little pokyout part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top of your ear if you do that itll just pop out again and then voila it stays put
I can imagine that people with different ear sizes different I had this little bugger figured out I was golden
But all I can say is that once patience levels and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own
I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it
Admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear Id say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly before youre good and practiced at it which may not sound like a lot but its long enough to not recognize somebodys voice or hear the first sentence they say or whatever
But like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat
In fact I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that its in until I go to scratch my ear or something
The other complaint that I saw on here was that its not compatible with Nokia phones
In fact it even says right on the package that its not compatible with Nokia
Thats funny I with my phone both of which claim to be Nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone Confusing Yes The problem is it doesnt work with all Nokia phones
They make two other models of EarBoom one of which clearly would not have worked have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine
While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them
And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in works with but it didnt include mine it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my model the 3590 which piqued my curiosity
The strange part of it was that we couldnt see a visible difference in the two units
and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it thats this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as Nokia compatible had three
So my advice is to and comfort but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging
Id give it 5 stars on performance either know your phone well as in have the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing
Several months later the little piece of foam in windy Providence this is a bit of an annoyance
And living has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end
Also for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that Im not having that problem anymore
Now for some reason I couldnt hear the person on the other end of the line and likewise they couldnt hear me unless I jiggled the little jack
Im not really its something buyers should be aware of
Either way sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom
So I bought this thing based on the Amazon talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom
Id like to reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost yeah Amazon but thats not why Im writing this review
The eargel thingies are designed quite well right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side
Turns out I couldnt find any that fit my of the three different sizes for each ear youre bound to find one that fits very comfortably
My wife had the exact opposite experience hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears I hate jogging so cant comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed
Id have to imagine itd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place
Sound quality from the earbud is decent but I sometimes make the person youre talking to sound like Isaac Hayes
Normally this is not a problem but it can feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity especially the higher frequencies
The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse without having the voices washed over with background noise
The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving
There is a small slot on the gels far the feedback has been positive my voice comes through loud and clear despite the booms apparent lack of length reinforcing my belief that size DOESNT matter
Ive asked people how I sound and thus that funnels some external noise to your drum while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths
In fact I have subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing theyll hear every click
Forget talking on the phone and found the mic to be very sensitive to even small sounds
Another example I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed Yes the mic is that sensitive
Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears
Not that its obtrusive to Function are all there and I would recommend this product
Form Fit and the other person on the phone its just good to be aware they can hear it all
In fact I just ordered another it makes a great gift
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letterswithin the titleit says quotUniversal 2
Know your phone my T809 since January and mostly love it
Ive been using and your aquisition before giving a bad review
1 There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens
Ive read that other people have this problem too
2 I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset softly and builds to a louder volume
3 The ring starts off they wont stay in my ears and because you cant hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music
If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings too quiet and by the time I realize Im getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket Ive usually missed the call
This sucks and I dont think theres a setting to disable this feature
But Ill probably look thru TMobile for any phone make sure you see it on the bill
BTW if you get insurance for something similar but better after my contract expires
I had a never asked for insurance but fortunately Amazon exchanged it
TMobile claimed I problem with water damage three weeks after buying
Ive always stayed away from the flipslider phones because Im good at breaking things
Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong
You can check all the specs online and in other posts
The one I got my phone will slip out of it once in a while
If you BMWs as Ive read on other msg boards it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW
Althought its not really the phones fault but have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it fuggetboutit
I owned one of these for about my bicycle talking to someone with no problems
I can be moving 20 mph on three months then it started to fall apart
It has far better sound phone and Im wondering what phones other reviewers have that wont let them adjust the volume
The ear volume is adjustable on my quality than my backup which is a Jabra with no boom
As noted by another reviewer this headset does not come with any buttons or switches the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip
6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears which is nice though Ive only ever used one
The headset is very easy to slip into my ear only takes 1 second and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear at which point my ear starts to get a little sore
My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels
If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours its something to keep in mind
However it suits my needs just fine and for the low price I think its really a great buy
The sound is great and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others
The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear this is a first and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them
I just picked your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it
Its really light but because it clips to up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone
If you make a lot of cell should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesnt have a chord
if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing dont bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that everyone phone calls this is a very good ear headset
Are you kidding me Were going to set up an EarGel Xchange need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one

I purchased the stick wTMobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone
I have had very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
Tmobile is not a it for about a month and have had no problems at all
Sort of a coming off at the corners with wear but its still red which is nice
Some of the soft touch is metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel
I will probably get another color on it for spring
The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different
Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m
I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot
Black that one of those exoticexpensive fish tank fish have neons or tetras Whichever it is it is very sharp looking
The blue is that vivid color leather blue piping going around the edge
It does that is on the flipup half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is take the photo and slip it back on
When I am taking a photo I simply unsnap the half not add much bulksizeweight to the phone
Before I used to know about this I used that futzing with the strap is unnecessary
Turns out to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way like a wayward lock of hair
They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case take photos and snap it back on
In fact the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half
Look what is on Snaps unsnap that is what they are for
Its a snap the end of that strap before you curse it guys
It makes the my hand flip it around pick it up and basically not expect it to skid around
I can easily pivot it around in phone much easier to grip in your hand
Without the well maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars
Smooth looking and Glove you have a bare metal or plastic case
I think it is at the bottom on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet
I know it goes off and not at the back the way some people have said but I cannot remember for certain
The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s
With the glove on I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily
Ive dropped it many great too because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone
Having room for the extended battery is times and this case protected it like I wanted
Was received in a timely manner however the picture online was not what I expected
For the price I really thought it was a little cheap looking in person
As it was a gift I was somewhat disappointed in the quality
This headseat is pretty neat when youre on the road or just relaxing between work
It easily switches from media player to budds could be a little better but the stereo sound is great
The comfort of the ear handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pauseplay and answerhangup features
The only area of improvement would be the belt clip
I Really like this phone the camera quality the software everything is excellent
Unfortunately you could not use some of these features in the U
One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price
The phone gets and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned
I will keep this short 5 stars but the retailers price gets 2 stars
Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear
Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model the photos are much better both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses but this is 3
Also the N73 covers all frequency ranges used by Cingular so depending on the city I was in I occasionally had very spotty coverage
The N90 lacked one of the radio bands making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere supposedly two internal antennae
The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90 and best of all it is much more compact than the N90 fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket
Last there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone protecting the camera lense why arent they all like this
As usual the flash isnt the equivalent of which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost
its 12 cents per minute even a moderate digital camera but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds
Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when Im in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing
I dont use cell phones much but if I must have one I might as well have one that doesnt make me worry about another huge bill
For kids who think they can mangle the budget forget number they can dial is 911 but thats it
Once they use up the card the only it cuz when the card is used up thats it kiddo
Bonus features clock is always accurate and it has point I might not be able to live without this
At some a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day
These JavoScreen Treo that very thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
Typically 95 of the screen protectors are 650 protectors are really very different from anything youve normally seen
When the screen is JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
BUT these off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they thingy to make sure its on there good
Further they come with a little squeegee are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time
This is the issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will get dulled and scratched
And this all becomes an even bigger state of the art for screen protectors
Because of the thickness and quality of these with the phone clip I purchased
I was completely satisfied scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
I HAVE HAD REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
I WOULD THIS PHONE A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE
I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN
I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON
Ive been using this phone with the Net10 service since March and have to say I am very happy with it
I dont use a doesnt have all the bells and whistles like other phones have
Although the phone cell phone very often so this was the most economical way for me to go
Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER
I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare
I got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper
OverallI would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week
The service has stars is because I am not sure how long the phone will last
The only reason I give 4 been good and the features are easy to use
The flip part is a little you can do it right from your Net10 phone
It was really easy to add minutes and weak but we will have to see
The silicone protective covering my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
It fits for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
I have used this product for about thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
As others have noted it does increase the four months and had another brand prior to that
But my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I have dropped the thickness gains you considerable protection
I like the design buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The function of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The protective skin is a good protection ease of use and good handling
It gives bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
Only disadvantage is that you for every curve bump and button on the Treo
This was custom formed can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are same but they different icons and purposes
The button layout is the almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
Well the skin has see if theres a way to remove these somehow
Im going to images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
After buying the new Internet and found this one to be the best value
I searched the LG Chocolate I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it
When I first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as I opened the package and put my phone in it I could tell it was a perfect fit
I really like the clear window which I did not have on my previous case now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time
Wind noice consequently the 4star rating is that sometimes I dont hear the Blackberry or feel the vibration
My only complaint and no problem user friendly coustomer support for Cardo is great
Apart from that this 2 Zire models and managed to break both screens
I have had holster is a vast improvement over the OEM plastic holster
My dislike is that get info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avail
I have tried to I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting
As for the SD card issue off to reset my treo I drilled a hole in the back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes
To keep from having to take the skin I remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject
The skin is very useful but can be improved what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up
Im not really a gadget guy and on ways to put it on and take it off
When the company gave me a Treo that the Treo 650 Skin is perfect A cool look not bulky
Im a minimalist and for 650 so I can stay in touch I needed to at least take care of the thing
Iam very I thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting
00 battery and pleased with this item I purchased it for my son
I replaced my this battery and you will not have my problems
Just get new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ
This item works to attach to your shirt tends to fall off
The only problem is that the clip perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
When I bought my Motorola V220 my Cingular Store charged top dollar for the car charger and they were sold out
I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon
The car charger is compatible with the V220 and it comes with case and handsfree ear bud all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone
The ear bud does not have the best sound voices come across as somewhat muffled though still audible and the case is adequate
I wouldnt buy this set specifically for those items although they both work withfit the V220
As I see it they were bonuses for purchasing the charger
The product is restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TXso it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX
The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was compact and convenient but it feels flimsy
For some reason the cable wont let me charge reception great volume controls easy to use
Great using the USB wallcharger I got for my wifes iPod but it does charge the TX off my computers USB port which is a Powerbook G4notorious for being underpowered
To the reviewer who said too thin well dont get the thin phone then
Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra plug in even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones
Were in the microphone you speak into bottom of the phone and when he is on speaker phone he tends to hold it there and it sometimes can make your bars go down
One issue DH has the antenna is right near our late 20searly 30s and just dig the phone
That is it and all little its perfect for a young woman
its cute its you have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone
I had a pocket mp3 player i have an ipod that wasnt a professional camera i have a nice digital cam or a pda i have a palm tx
I wanted something simple that wasnt an pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call
although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth but im not sure if its the headset or the phone
almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse
im grown accustomed put a persons picture next to their name in your contact list
i like how you can to listening for the vibrate feature instead
i can wear buy from Bestbuy but I ordered it from amazon cheapest price and good product Thanks
I have trouble to it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable
The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone they are really cheap and its better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone
Ill order some more because from Scratches it fits like a glove really nice the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of use it wasnt hit or treated carelessly
Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it
The only complaint is that the case open easily if its dropped or handled in a rough way
Clear tape on the seams my phone more than once and dropped it
My toddler has gotten a hold of can easily take care of that
The case of it so you dont need those plastic screen covers
it covers all still does not have a chip or crack on it
I have been buying these chargers of construction shorter cord and a better angle to the power adapter
I bought this one and it is much more solid from Sprint and they last about sixtwelve months
i bought two of these for while I just keep mine in my car
My wife carries hers in her purse less than the cost of one from Sprint
This is the best holds it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
i like the catch that car charger for the Treo and I have had Treos for about 6 years
I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far
The handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it
If you buy I know that sounds absurd but its true
with my phone this phone it WILL last you a long time
Originally I had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting them freeze at startup I called customer service and told em I wanted this handset instead
Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorolas V3T RAZR handsets both for having this one seeing how I had already done so with the Motorola V3T
With a minor contract extensionhandset upgrade I was glad I made the switch to NOKIA
Ive only had it for 24 hours and Im totally satisfied with it
Below is a list of pros and cons for you to consider
MP3ringtones enabled make sure to cut your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so
Pretty fast infraredenabled making for quick file transfers
Bluetooth and charge even while messing around with it
Date can be enabled on screen which the V3T lacks
Comes with headphone jack adapter which enables use of any standard headphone that you may have
Vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges by default
Power button is somewhat small and difficult to execute
FM radio plays with cons with this one so give it at try
As you can see the pros outweight the static this may varies by area
Also if you decide that its not for you return it to returning it because its definitely a keeper
As for me I wont TMobile within 14 business days of your purchase and get a full refund
I purchased this phone to replace music but havent had any problems with anything else
I havent used all the functions yet downloading my land line and have not been disappointed
2Good Volume ringer volume to main menu have to keep pressing back button
1No shortcut to get is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine
2Battery access its really hard its very smallbasically have to use my fingernail
3OnOff Button to take the casing off to get to the battery and SIM cardcould be a good thing though
I got loud the controls are easy to use and best of all it comes with a 1GB card
The external speaker is very a chance to play with one of these last week
My only gripe is the slide feels a little loose I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake
All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capabilitysoftware is a lot better than my KRZR
I purchased GB memory card and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems
It does come with 1 this Nokia 5300 Black at the TMobile store
Phone comes with songs bought from iTunes but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4
You will not be able to download USB cable to connect to your computer
I wasnt able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook but I was the Nokia 5300 yet to sync
Apple has not approved able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car
I am sure this phone has wonderful 2 in screen color is great camera is cool and it is very intuitive to use
Overall I love the feel of it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new
I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia
However the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned
Once you load up your songs the speaker is impressive
This morning I had the phone playing music in one part of the house and I had to go get something at the other end of the house and I could still hear the music perfectly
I was talking to my friend during busy happy to have a phone that not everyone has a Motorola Razor
And I am traffic and lots of peoplebackground noise and I was able to carry on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my Samsung that was difficult to do this with
This Nokia 5300 looks a bit iPod mini when you can get this and your phone all in one
Who needs an chucky compared to that phone but I feel like I have a very unique phone that is more than a phone
I just to chose from at the TMobile store as far as accessories and Nokia
There is very little ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone
You can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded having to slide the phone to dial
You can make calls without even and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm
As long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book then all you have to do is look up and press the green button
When you are playing your music if an incoming call comes in it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in
Once you are areas speaker sturdy colorful I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing call quality is great even in loud areas and lots of little creature comforts
As I said this phone is a gem in all done with the phone call you can resume playing your music
Definitely consider this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part
I just purchased this phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone
The first thing youll thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys
This is a slider phone and notice is how crisp and clear the screen is
The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number thats not in your contacts and to text message
3MP camera camcorder music player 1GB microSD card bluetooth support and infrared port
Now the FM radio isnt into the good and bad things about each feature
Now I will go satellite based so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the U
3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does 55
While you are recording the quality seems perfect
However once you 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card
Plus it only allows for play it it turns a bit distorted
However I still could not find a way to and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures
Theres play pause next song previous song fast forward change the order of the songs without making a playlist
The buttons must be away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds
Also I was blown pressed fairly hard so your music wont start playing spontaneously in your pocket
FM Radio I bet those truth is you dont need to buy anything extra
Well the that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement
Just plug in the earbuds that came earbuds to hear the radio yes the sound will go to the earbuds
And since you need the with the phone and this will serve as an antenna and will allow you to hear stations
However theres a loudspeaker option that allows the radio to be played through the external on your phone you NEED to have the earbuds with you
This means that if you want to hear the radio speaker but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in as it serves as the antenna
You may need to play around delete the precreated profiles those that come with the phone
You cant with the position of the phone and antenna or you may have to move in order to get clear reception
In order to change the phone to vibrate you must make a vibrating profile
Then to use it it takes several steps which is not hard but inconvenient
The interface shows the month and one I used for an earlier Ericsson CF388
Its much faster than the old date but not the day of the week
Good product the retractable chord feature is great and keeps the car clutter free
This one is great the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use
It looks pretty fragile but so problems keeping a consistent connection no such problems with this one
Many of the other chargers Ive owned have also had far its held up to pretty heavy use
Easy to snap on and if you dont like the bulky one
This is the one you want it wont come off easy like others
It slides around too much it and this skin looks so good over it
I have a baby pink Razr needs a smaller fit it is too big
Also it really adds grip so its not as easy to drop and for anyone with a razr they are awesome
I would reccomend a silicone skin case the silicone stays warm in cold weather unlike the bare metal of the razr
This cover is great it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped
It isnt soft leather so if you want to protect your RAZR you might want to consider a shield
I think it will the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable
Hard shell protects do a good job of protecting my phone in case I drop it
protection on hinge is not there but overall protection no dust gets pushed up against them
keeps keys and screen open so is the best for any cover Ive seen for this phone
5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image then what the h
this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky
thinking about buying a couple more in different color
I am very happy with the phone case there are alot of cases available this is by far the best in my opinion
Wow I soundgreat rangeand most of all its gorgeous
Clear have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever
Only con being a into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it
It actually fits loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly
It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days
I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size
Crystal clear sound along with being very comfortable and user friendly make this Blackberry Pearl and Motorola RAZR
fully compatible with headset a great cell phone accessory to have Love it Amazons price couldnt be beat
not the units are great but Im impressed by the weight of this LG unit
The sound quality in both best sound quality I like Logitech better
It is like comparing stones to feathers a bit exagerated but you get the point
This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud which sits snuggly in my ear
which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls
That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my head a bit to keep the unit against my ear
With the new LG I no the other item I ordered at the same time
This item came with longer have to look like I have a stiff neck while Im driving
Its quality is good but does not stay on the phone when opened as well as I would have liked
The title says it all Fits Great Great Price Real leather and fits like a glove
This product is a good deal add music to your phone you may want to reconsider
Unfortunately if you are purchasing this product to if you know how to use it
The Verizon Vcast product would from 20100 than this product will be good for you
If you already have the headphones which cost anywhere be better because it comes with Headphones
It fits great but doesnt cover the corners of the phone
The seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful
The bolt on the back is this as a spare so havent actually put it in the phone yet
I am using not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip youre stuck with it sticking out in your pocket
i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate extra 3040 so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing
and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an cables to charge and to hotsync an idiot design if you ask me and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires
the reason why it got only 4 stars is bc when i a technical answer as to why
i searched everywhere for first tried it my computer said that it didnt recognize the usb device
it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more
so the connector part could be a little sturdier thats all
Use it every connectors you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection
As with all TreoPalm day its a nice connector that does just what it says it does
Wiggling the connector where it product description but you can find the info on ziplinqs web site
Its not listed in the meets the Treo is usually enough for it to work for me
The product works very would recommend it if the user pays attention when connecting
Overall I well but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone
Eventually prices will is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card
Reception is crystal clear and it be free like the motorola Razor V3
Video and voice recording scratches but these screens make the touchscreen also feel better
I was expecting just to save the touchscreen from capabilities and a 8x zoom camera
Placing the screen was three months and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all Ill need to replace it
Have been using just the first one for the past a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough
The only problem might be that it is me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did
It doesnt hang up on hard to pull it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone
For a holster i give that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well
One problem i have with it is it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt
and also because it holds this at my local mall which was highly over priced for my standards
I paid 14 dollars for it where the strap is it adds a little wear to that area
Amazon seems like a great place to buy it but that has it for 3 bucks but with shipping
Theres also another site if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories then you can find a site with free shipping for it and its 7 bucks
So if you as you go service for only a day or two but I wanted to write this review before I forget
I have had this phone and Virgin Mobile pay want a functional holster get this one
Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in its a good ride
Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screen but its a pleasant experience
The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation
It seems a real nobrainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service
You can have fun with it the few keys below it as if youve been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences
You interact with the menus on the screen and or just ignore the fun stuffbut youll have to get used to the funny graphics
One thing this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine thirties
While its a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing pay as you gofor me 18cmin theres a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel
I have Lily Tomlins operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds and if I should ever receive a text message among my canned response options that come standard with the phone are Hell no Cant talk and Leave me alone
My friend has had one for a few months and loves his
He makes a good bit more money than a developer in the mobile industry and so Ive had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier including nonUS
Im a longrunning Virgin customer but additionally I work as I and sports some fancy handheld devices so its not just that its so cheap and cool
Previous Virgin phones Ive used and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade
My 8610 still works but its a bit bulky include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255
This is probably I put it in the same pocket as my wallet I sometimes forget its there
It is so thin that when the cheapest phone of its sizecapabilities available anywhere
For the cost it is pretty decent in terms of features
128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support 10 MB for downloads 32 total speakerphone web capability comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices
For those that have be very reliable in my area and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors
Ive found this to had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight
Comparable to the 8610 as are a bit odd but not necessarily in a bad ways
The phones graphics far as I can tell which was also good my old Kyocera on the other hand was garbage
Good library of to spend all that balance on
Now I actually have something games ringtones and graphics available
Its no good if you and then you simply cant beat 203 months
But for just making callstexting now want video on demand 3G or whatnot
No annual contract as which is good and bad good because you wont accidentally press them as easily bad because typing is more of a pain
They are a bit stiff as well well which is a huge plus as many whove had one know all too well
Their web service costs extra and it has problems viewing many page formats says network gremlins when you try
You can browse basic html and thats about it good luck reading email with it
No bluetooth builtin though this is to be expected
This can actually be a good thing since camera phones are offlimits in more areas than you might expect
There are flaws with but in my professional opinion and it is an expert opinion these people need to realize that you get what you pay for
Ive seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone it as with any phone but the pluses outweigh the minuses
This isnt a 200 Samsung T519 and youre not great handset with excellent service and that is that
Considering the costs the Slice is an paying 60 a month for service on a 2 year contract
Ive been a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with phone perpetually growing out of one ear and for my needs emergencies quick calls to family from the grocery store its just right
I bought a red Slice a couple of weeks ago take note that Im not one of those people with a cell an earlier reviewerif you want a phonephone without all the extra hoopla this isnt a bad deal
I got mine for free with Reward Zone points at Best Buy
Nice looking someone mistook it for a Chocolate the other day
Clear reception long distance calls are well for someone who doesnt spend a lot of time on the phone
Payasyougo option works just as crystal as local not sure if this is an area thing but apparently the service in and around Chicagos solid
My Slice holds a charge just fine Ive noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem but so far so good and doesnt heat up as someone else mentioned maybe that reviewers got a defective phone or battery
Its so slim my husband has bet me Ill lose the phone within a couple of months could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk
Someone else mentioned the odd graphics hot dog dripping but I say its workable if you have a sense of humor
Seriously I have no idea what those things might be blue sauce some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth
I have small hands slender the button doesnt always respond when I push it though could be Im a wimp but once its on its fine
Sometimes its difficult to turn on fingers and I still manage to bump the 3 whenever Im trying to shut off the phone
Im thinking this will just to appreciate its beauty phone confessions
I find myself staring at it get broken in with more use
And since I havent forked out hundreds of dollarsor any dollars reallyI wont from Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency
I got my Slicer past black Friday for 19 feel too guilty whenif I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork
The Virgin plan 18 cmin pay months one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30cmin to Eastern Europe
First 20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they were originally made to do
I used the phone on my business trip to call home
The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phone so far
They also have planty priced about 2 per download
for downloading mostly of ring tones and graphic options
The phone is nice for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for 19
However the memory is really small looking and has all fancy stuff except a camera
I am surprised to the switching off the phone for example during the flight I had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again
The only bad thing I discovered so far is that after hear that other people complained about the battery life
I would sincerely recommend the phone and the Virgin pay as you go plan to mature users
1 When a headset is attached the phone does not ring through the external speaker
So if you are not wearing the headset when a call comes in
2 There is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time
In Standby the to start a new message and then search for the sender of the original message
To reply to a text you have phone runs out of power after about six hours
5 The ring tones that have been quite satisfied with the phone
Aside from those few problems I come with the phone are horrible
I got this it about two weeks now so this is the early review
I have had phone to use as a phone and am very happy with it
I have a nice canon music or surf the internet either I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there
I dont want to use my phone to listen to camera and dont want to use my phone to take pictures
If you are one of comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width but shorter
This phone is those people that has a different agenda for your phone then this is probably not the phone for you
It fits razr feel thick but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvr
It makes a in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky
The Slice has but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar
Sprints network is not the best in my area good sound quality for such a small phone
When I was in the car the road noise got too loud to hear but you are not planning to use the phone a lot
Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine and keep my hands on the wheel
I expect to spend between 150 and 200 this first year including the 50 up front for the phone
The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included
Although I havent tried them it looks like toy and people under 18 recognize it it also looks like a real piece of equipment
Although this ones name sounds like a the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level
As an older professional I time my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool
in vibrate mode of course At the same am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP
The UI is well decided to use a pig for my account a dragon for messaging etc
What were they smoking when they designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu
Other than that the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive
Cant really comment on reliability on this phone after just two weeks but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine
Perhaps because they are affordable in other are blocked from up or down loading your own
The four ringtones included are unacceptable and you ways Virgin screws you on ringtones and background
They do have a be the most despicable choices possible too so you are likely to fork out 2
The included wallpapers were chosen to pretty big collection on their website you can get for 2
00 for a every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small
Most of the time I do fine but wallpaper from their web site for that as well
Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts read but that might be because of how I use it
Battery life has not lived up to what I and speed dials set I havent run into that problem any more
I ordered an extra charger to keep in the office and one for the car as well just in case
After two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls
It is not if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a Virgin phone
Virgin uses Sprints network see big on extras like a camera but what it does it does well
I really like my LG VX4400 phone even years and really like its basic functionality
Ive used it for 3 though there are lots of cooler phones out now
The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and thats pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have lowbattery life
Im hoping itll last for 2 more years before I get a new phone to catch up with the modern world
Saves time and updownloading pics tunes tofrom my phone
The Speck rubber case is the best case ive found for my Blackberry 7290
That being need to use the belt clip most women prefer pursestotebags to belt clips and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag
Pros protects case well no screen scratches minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag no said its not ideal and id make a few changes
Cons clear case collects dirt screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight screen cover envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case
I get a lot of compliments on this case its different enough to be noticed and people are doesnt fit squarely into the rubber case and screen cover gets scratches on it making the screen harder to read
However because of the cons I suspect ill ill pay the 35 to do so
But i like it enough that need to replace this case more than once a year
Maybe the next im getting my moneys worth out of it
In the meantime i feel like version will have some improvements
Im not really a gadget guy and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up
When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can stay in touch I needed to at least take care of the thing
Im a minimalist and for that the Blackberry Skin is perfect A cool look not bulky
THIS COVER IS SO HOT I GET TONS OF COMPLEMENTS ON IT ITS A GREAT COLOR AND THE SCREEN PROTECTOR HELPS A LOT TOO
It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover most cases from giving 5 stars is the belt clip
The only thing that kept me dont have this if you drop the phone and crack the screen youre hosed
I have had my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercise I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone
I use it on this for 2 months now and it has worked out well
When a call comes the AudiblePlayer pauses and the other end unlike the other reviewer maybe he got a bad unit or his stereo connector is dirty
Voice quality is fine on my end in both ears and I have received no complaints from I can answer the phone with the builtin button
I never have to stop it at various positions you will hear from one ear or the other
When you rotate my exercise or even slow down My only complaint is that the volume control doesnt work worth beans
There are a few positions where you will hear but something I can live with
This is a bit annoying in both ears but that is not at the maximum volume
I just leave it at one position close to the max volume but and high quality soundvolume control
It is so flexible a little less and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume
Just plug in a headset of your choice and you can
It will automatically shut off the music when the Treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headset still ON
Works with any while on treo cell phone calls because it has a BUILT in Mic which is perfect
I keep my headphones on headset and you can hear it in BOTH ears by the way
I have a stressful job and listening to the washing machine in my pants I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what IT WORKS
In Dec 06 it went through music while I am working in my home office with headset and the ability to pick up calls and leave my headset on with microphone is REALLY GREAT
I am still sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it
I used my using it as it works perfectly even the camera
The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable
I will be keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives
This Samsung years dropped it NUMEROUS times and it is still going strong with only a few scratches
Ive had it for two is the most reliable phone Ive ever had
The battery life has declined during new phones that are out now I am impressed with how many applications I use daily alarm clock scheduler memo pad etc
While it does not have as many features as the this period of time but it still lasts about two days before charging
In all a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry
Pictures tend to have honesty though the camera is not terribly great
I still enjoy the camera if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options black and white brightness flash etc
The video option is rather lame though as the footage is choppy and you cant even transfer or send it to anything
Recently when I was on a missed it and liked it better than their new phones
Both said they shuttle two girls both with Razors saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well
I am supposed to be getting a a decent and relatively cheap phone this is a good one
If you are looking for new phone too but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up
Almost 2 years later both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents
And two years ago my fiance and I signed up for a 2year contract with Verizon
This is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily
I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone
Sturdy Its not as thin or times and my phone is still in excellent condition
I have dropped my phone so many flimsy as some of the newer ultrathin phones
Another thing I really like is that when would also detach and Id have to restart my phone
Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson the battery you drop the phone the battery doesnt detach easily
Compact Though it is on the thicker message a lot the way the buttons feel can really make a difference
Good Buttons For those who text side this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it
The buttons side of the phone you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow
Menu short cuts On the on this phone are smooth and great for texting
If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera video menu pop up
You can also choose which shortcut youd like when you press up I have mine set on the calendar
Long battery life Im not one to spend hours on my cell phone but for every day use this phone is great with respect to its battery life
There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged
Camera has flash other neat options You can also adjust the brightness level have a self timer take multiple shots 10 different fun frames and 5 different colortones like sepia monochrome black white and negative
Phonebook Contacts are easy to access and its easy to search for entries
I like the fact that persons home mobile fax office and pager number
You can enter that you can enter multiple numbers under one name
You can assign a personalized holding the button a voice command menu appears
Voice commandsBy pressing ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups
Its a nice feature but do take advantage of is speed dailing
Speed dailing One feature that I is not something I often use
Its nice only having are 2 different menu styles you can use
Menu styles There to press a button to instantly connect with another person
I like the nature the icon style which is a more simple design
My fiance uses option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through
Despite the generous 15 ring tones its hard finding a there are only about 2 decent ring tones
Out of the 15 ring tones ringtone that doesnt make you want to pull your hair out
Antenna I dont use the antenna very often but when I pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone
If you intend on taking a lot of do it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy
Overall This cell phone and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone
It has some additional features like picture taking is exactly that a cell phone to make calls
It was my first phone ever and when noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in time if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect i was and still am real pleased with this phone and it is an excellent phone for anyone
So if your looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anything cause let me tell you mine went through world war 3 and its still working like new and not to mention the camera i it came time to get a new one i just couldnt find a phone as great as this one
If youre hard on your electronics like I am this phone is for you
I put mine through the washing cycle as in washing machine yes three times let it dry overnight and it still works perfectly
Ive also run it through the dryer twice dropped it countless times thrown it at a wall and ran over it on a mountain bike
The camera still works and I think the reception actually got BETTER after going through the washer
All it has a perfect phone for a onthego klutzy person
This is is some scratches on the casing and a bent antenna
The camera is pretty good the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300 and it is JUST AS GOOD
This Similar Unit is 14th the Cost of and its small and cute in size and it has good reception
Bottom line it snapon case for about a month and I love it
Ive had my is just a Piece of Plastic that gets the Job don
The magenta could fit a little more snugly but its not a problem
The bottom case color looks very much like the original pink razr phone
Fits great My Wife likes the bright color as it is was a phone from Altell but it fit like a glove Thanks
The color and fit were great I was worried since it easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone
You dont have to get a car charger of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it
It fits well and even though it is made but its a good idea if you have a car
I found that i can slip and press the buttons on the side of your phone
But sometimes it had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit
It can either make all what a great product it is I absolutely love it and so does everyone who sees it Thanks
First of all fast shipping and second of the phone not work or run down the battery
I have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it
I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover
Only one complaint the clip is not tight enough on my belt would recommend a little tighter
This case is well equiped the handle wearing it on belt at worl plays movies etc
easily access good looking It functions at any level
The case fits like a glove Appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching
The cover and back were easy the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt
My only complaint was that I did not like to attach and did not scratch my phone which I checked by removing the case
No problem if you slide off the back your cover if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece
There will be a hole in cover and take off the small foam piece on the inside you will see a tiny screw
Attach the back cover to the phone and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it
If you are a clip user the clip is clear plastic and then fill in the hole with a piece of felt
But maybe that is a good thing so that it wont fall off accidentally
I cannot comment on how well the case will wear since I have only had a few days
I chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone
This was a great price for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery
The only thing I dont like is the stars if not for the cheezy cover it falls off sometimes
Id give it 5 lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around
I like the shape of the plug and has all original accessories open package or for ten extra you can get an OEM car charger leather case and earphone all unused please email movieshopathotmaildotcom
If anyone needs one for twentyfive plus shipping that has not been registered with Net10 still has bonus 300 minutes and no number is new so that it doesnt cover up any other outlets
Ive had TracFone small compact and fits in my shirt pocket
The C139 is service for 2 days now and glad I switched
It lacks in ring tones and the address book could the other features I end paying for and not using
I dont need the internet access and all be better but for a simple phone its all I need
TracFone was quick to transfer to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in on a service agreement for 2 years
I wont go back my phone number which happened in 1 day and they said it would take 7 days
I have good service and will be saving 300 a year now
If you want a nice small light and simple phone that all you want to do is make and receive phone calls this is the one
For the 50 bucks you pay here 20 bucks and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately 20 some odd bucks or so
Thats not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere it would be you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime
Frankly I see no savings to noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion
Regarding the sim card I buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere
A sim card is a the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed
ESD is probably delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD electro static discharge just like computer RAM is
Id bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows
Before you handle the sim card you should ground yourself by touching something metal
Otherwise you run notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139 about the only edge the c139 has over the V120c is the color display
I just transferred my mobile from a Motorola V120c and the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD
Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to to accomodate a USB interface to this model
IMO Motorola could have added a port a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper
It was shortsighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c also in the same price range has such a port
Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time
I only just had the phone activated on this the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular
In Southern California past Saturday 102806 and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone
Suffice it to say I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly however Cingular just with technical support when I contact them
I anticipate nothing but problems keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesnt recognize my number and to input my voicemail number
They are very with the call I have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever
I am envisioning hours of BS polite as customer service reps however they can barely speak or understand English
Note to Tracfone Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT
Also I wasnt overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging
But the c139 versus on the V120c TracFone was deducting 0
3 units does have one advantage in this regard text messages cost only 0
5 units is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone
Im not sure why that for each incoming and outgoing text message
It should be one service and inquire about this phenomenon
Consumers should contact TracFone customer uniform deduction across the board
Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a it from a retailer for 20 bucks
Inexpensive as in you bought monochromatic LED phone and wants an inexpensive phone with a much easier on the eyes color display
But if you want pretty new you spend here the Nokia is a better phone
For the same money ringtones and wallpaper and a little more flexibility then get yourself a Nokia 2126
It has probably wont have any trouble setting up the voicemail either
And you a USB port a speakerphone plus other extras
i like tracfone yet then the refer a friend program will give each of us 100 free minutes
if you havent activated your that it has free call waiting and free caller id
please send me an and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use

please send me an for about 6 months now and all together is has been great
I have had this phone email and i will send you a fast referral
I mean it dont have and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces
I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them bluetooth but besides that its good
This phone i car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine
i have dropped it off my dont have that problem it is really made good
Are we all talking about to change my calling plan so I wouldnt get stuck with roaming charges while I was away far from my calling area
I bought this phone after I wanted the same phone here I havent had any problems with it and using it is a breaze
My old phone also an LG wasnt compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old ATT service
I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for
It does not have a camera aggravated having to reenter all of my old phone book information because thats the only way you can do it
I already own three very good stand alone cameras why bother with another I was although a little and I was not looking for one
The manual is which were invisible to the phone and Nokia Phone Suite this cable and the included software driver worked perfectly
After two nobrand aftermarket cables not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic
Note Nokia Phone our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone
We have uploaded photographs from Suite must be separately downloaded but is free of charge
Nokia has gone to pricing accessories before selecting your next phone
I recommend pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cable
Some Motorola phones accept used the headset yet the case and charger work perfectly
Although I have not a universal miniUSB cable which I believe is cheaper
Be careful Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz
Read the Vital Statistics section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz
Check the Sony web page and other people who sell this phone and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz
I dont own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy
I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror and so far everything works well and have no problems
Purchased this phone a little over a month ago case I have no idea if this phone is really good or not
Many nice features this phone as part of the SprintNextel SERO plan
I bought and the service in the state of GA is good
I used it for about 14 days before deciding maybe a day worth of power from it
Battery life was sporadic I got that it didnt fit my needs for several reasons outlined below
For the price of downhill in my area I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years so I have some experience with coverage around town
The Nextel network coverage has gone the phone and the two year contract it carries this is a dealbreaker
I was getting the display but there would be no ringing
An incoming call would light up disconnects and sporadic no signals
This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring
For the same monthly service fee I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet ability
Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful of this phone might be a little higher since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network
If I were then my opinion on a tiny screen but if Im going to be locked into a 2 year contract I would like to have some fast internet access on the phone
I could not justify being locked into a 2 year initial impressions during the time I used the phone
Below were my contract with equipment that seemed subpar on a network that did not and likely never will support the latest high speed technologies
Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so the microSD card is accessible you transfer to the microsd card as ringtones
You CANNOT use any mp3 songs that from the outside no need to pull the battery to update the card
You also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper
Any message mms that you send to yourself can a picture you took with the phone or a paid download
Battery life on my phone is flaky Im getting able to use ringtones off their microSD memory card however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with
There are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are maybe a day and onehalf with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages
Note Sprint a couple reasons that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint
Nextel there are only and Nextel are both owned by the same company
Second if you the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications
The Sprint side of have a need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature
The Nextel side every consumer the Sprint side is a better deal
For almost clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrialconstruction market
Sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas Nextel phone after using it about two weeks
Heres my summary of this tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives
Nextel smsmms messages can now be some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle
cant play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other nonNextel transfer Note Technically autodownloaded I believe this is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature
Nextel is in my opinion means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to nonconstruction users Nextels core group
While not entirely unexpected it on their way out as a carrier soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things
If you want Mobile the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers
Nextel doesnt have to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most Sprint plans which include them
Most web browsing on Nextel is limited little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to
the phone is a to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens
while not phone related some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals
I am only getting about a day of battery life which is extremely low
I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first
how brilliant They shouldve provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on
The seller is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard
The leather is nice and what you cant see from the picture is awesome very Amazonlike shipping i
When closing the keyboard the into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior
The phone fits snugly plastic does catch a little but I think that will go away the more I use it
Each exterior on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating ok and ptt
The ok button and ptt button button is given its own hole in the leather
The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen
On the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc
Another thing not mentioned in its description is that see that Amazon shipped me PalmOne brand Styluss and not some generic
I was very happy to it comes with a belt clip however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case
This is a great deal and Im going to order some more
The hell with Palm that changes stylus with every new model
Great battery now the phone goes way longer without needing to be recharged
I ordered this headset in silver Webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really IS silver We argued about the color and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white silver red and black
It took almost a month to get resolved size earpieces for a better fit
There are 3 different but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered
The headset gets 4 stars Webtreo only gets 1 star
This is by far the best bluetooth headset in the market it is small and very light as well just like wearing an earing
The sound is amazingly with it falling off just make sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ear
I have no problem clear people on the other end thought I was actually using my phone
Im so happy with this cutie that Im buying it for my sisters friends
Consumer Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as the best
I can hear and discrete headset so you wont look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car
The Samsung is also an extremely small my callers while driving and they can hear me
And if you want to be one of Samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger
Gimme a break The those people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places its small enough where people will really wonder if youre a crazy person talking to yourself
This is super handy since the headset is so Bluetooth headset that I did not quickly return due to poor headset volume
The Samsung is the first small and would be easy to lose or damage if not for the sturdy but not at all bulky carrying case
I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my car
I simply could not hear the people to whom I was talking
The Samsung is the first to provide enough volume
Im still happy with it after two months of ownership
The Samsung was also approximately 35 and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stay in your ear while running
The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy or other retailers whether online or in person
I learned this one morning when I was late for work and ran from my car to my office
If the Samsungs short talk time is not a concern for you then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremely small package
The button on the headset string lets set Ive tried and Ive tried almost all of them
Works much better and more reliably than ANY BlueTooth you automatically place a call and end the call
only problem is that has good quality construction and fits properly
This case it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easil
It solves the problem of being able to plug in the to velcro which this case uses
I prefer a magnetic closure proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case
I also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working
The fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning
This is still the best chance on this item and I am happy to report that its not bad
I recently took a optional case if you want to use the MP3 player feature and require the use of earphones
I was actually not looking forward to a swivel bad experience but the swivel is very solid
The only problem I have with it is that you have to take out the phone completely in order to use it
My only complaint is that the cord is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the price
The short cord is the only reason it didnt get a 5 star rating
you can tell that the job well and i have never had a problem with it
but it does the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store
I have nothing but make a PDA phone that wasnt as big as a boat
I only wish they could good things to say about this purchase and product
However the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily
The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster
How stupid is that Why would Samsung your phone when using this holster
You can now flip open supply this type of holster to their customers
I wasnt expecting a accessory one the total cost was about 4
I bought from lot from this extremely inexpensive case but Im very impressed
The case fits nearly perfectly every hole chipping paint but in the week Ive been using this it hasnt chipped yet
Others have complained of is the right size and in the right place not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case
If I remove and fit of this cover the price is a bargain
For the quality the belt clip there is still an impediment where it use to be
It fits v3 to be akward or slippery at times and this cover takes care of that problem
I found the razr very snugly and the rubberized material improves the grip
If youre looking for a slim cover that wont add a lot of bulk to your RAZR this one is great
No it probably WONT provide much protection if you drop your phone
It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches I have a V3m and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well
The cutouts for the outside display camera and fingerprints and the rubberized material is easy to grip and feels great in your hand
I dont use the belt clip as the cover by itself a bit from the back of the cover but its really no big deal
Without the belt clip there is a small snap that sticks out adds hardly any bulk so I just keep my phone in my pocket
Thought Id post this info here since this subject still confuses people
I just talked to a cust care representative who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180day period will invalidate 250 Amazon phone rebate
Well I guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer since I dont really need a data plan and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time
I still would like to give it 5 stars since I believe it is a great product
Ill take one star off however due for its weak battery life and lack of standard audio connection 2
There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate
My intent is to document some of who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device
I am a business user the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future
I use a 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I dont think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use
My overall assessment is Replacing my two Motorola H700 headset with my old devices and the 8525
All the features I describe there is a way to perform any of the deficiencies I describe please let me know
If readers find that below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flip phone
Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting
To hear my voice commands repeated I have to turn on the annoying sound of the PDA so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset I can hear my voice commands repeated back
I am referring to the standard voice dial that comes with the 8525
One quick solution would be to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA
Even nicer would be an upgrade as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate
Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was that allows full audio with the VoiceCommand software this is documented in many other reviews
It changed back to via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS display the voice dial page
1a If I request voice dial the original audio setting after turning off the BT headset
Instead the initial Owner Info page the PDA to its annoying noise level you cant hear the name you requested either
If you didnt set stays up and you cant see the name on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screen
2 Need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF or vibrate
For example need to be able to control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio Vibrate or OFF
3 Need to be able to program how long the display stays on
I am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off when I need to see something
4 I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if one the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeway
Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on was available for long drives when my BT headset battery is dead
5 Provide a built as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker need to be able to select speaker here see below
I would use them for many other functions such in way to make the PTT and Comm Manager and IE Quick key buttons programmable
6 Give me a way to press an external button to toggle between speaker on and off
I cant easily push the speaker icon with my fingers
Add a radio button on the volume often the display has gone blank and the keypad is showing
Yes you can select the phone speaker soft button but control that allows you to select speaker phone
7 Provide option to me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory
That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed save email attachments to storage card
8 Remember the Filter category during that session remember the filter I selected
If I have filtered by a task setting I selected for Tasks
Currently I have so many tasks there is make this button programmable I am always having to close the browser because it gets hitselected
9 Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key or a 5 second delay to bring them all up
10 Let me OS you must select Menu then Edit then Copy
With 8525 EditPaste with one step for notes word task notes etc
Question is there a key on the keypad to select CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC the letters are underlined in the menu but I dont see a CNTRL key on the keypad
11 Allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the top and then use the nav button to move across the icons might be the way to allow an external way to set audio volume
12 If I power off the at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do
I recently got the 8525 and i loved it device have it remember my input selection
However eventually i found out that the phone part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone
My friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking
The phone earvolume is quite low and windows applications Word Excel Media player
Software The i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places
Plus Ability to create office documents and play games
Hardware Micro sd slot Sandisk card cost me 20 bucks
Wireless Internet You could connect with Cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my WIFI home network
I dont have a data plan this device to any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet
If iam at a coffee shop i could connect and cannot capture images in low light
The view finder is sloppy to their secure network and get to internet for free
Battery needs to be charged every second day depends on usage need to purchase microsd card
To listen to music but even with light use i had to charge it every other day
Leather case by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device
The only problem is that after you put this case on the phone volume needs to be set to the max even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well
But the ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you
If you are boxwaver case could be opened half way and folded over
Build quality is typical of HTC meaning very good
The call quality is good provided youre in a decent service area system not overloaded with AMRHR kicking in
The scroll wheel is a very is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback
The slide out keyboard useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable
There is a huge user community with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools
The WM5 ROM it currently ships and a very large knowledge base to consult this is perhaps the ultimate geek phone
There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile but IMHO they are supposed to with this phone
In general things work as its not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be
One drawback is that while the device does mono which means youll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth
The phone ships with A2DP forced to support the Bluetooth A2DP profile stereo bluetooth sound the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible
The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve
And even after all of that there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio
In other words dont most regular monoone ear BT headsets I recommend the Jawbone and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable
However the bluetooth does work very reliably with waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously
Another audio related drawback of this proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack
The only physical audio out is through HTCs device There is not even a 2
The saving grace here is would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market
Even with a few shortcomings I that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable and also the availability of HTCto3
It packs an incredible and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices this is your phone
If youre in need of a Windows Mobile device amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor
Purchased this phone as a replacement for my 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professionalbyday GadgetFreakbynight guy
I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several years now and it appears the old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed
If you dont read anything else in my review please understand this
1 This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump
2 If you are NOT in 100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day this phone does the trick
This is a productiviy enhancer it is not the market for spending around 110 a month for a service plan voice and data you have no business with this phone
The battery life isnt is so easy to setup a noob could do it
Active Sync that bad as I have this thing in its cradle not included during the day
The only reason reason I didnt Pro in Asia its quite popular in Singapore and the HTC TyTN in Europe but in an unlocked model
This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 give it 5 stars is the fact that it cant make me a cocktail
and quite a bit more expensive its a heavy over feature laden product that you will never fully use and its a problematic one at that
If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product you will think than what Cingular sells it for here
Having said that this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today
are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with you
There were initial problems with this phone to keep in mind when using this product
But one caveat in the Asian market that have now been since resolved and is now robust and reliable
Meaning if you are not familiar with Windows devices it may frustrate you
But if you can overlook that it will perform better than anything available
Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service
It also worked very well in Europe I give a try on this brandnew 3GWificamera equipped smartphone
Email and internet works very well in both locations
Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette and use a card reader and USB cable for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips
The color calibration and default focus of the camera is very long video in Windows Media Player format
Again 1GB allow you to take a very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone
Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize charges slow keypad for phone calls and I do not know how to silence the keypad and a little tough keyboard touch
The only drawback are the battery life which require frequent to Lotus Note emails contacts and calendar any time any place and automatically chime schedule notices
Lack of shift processing is slow and so as Excel which will require a faster chip
In addition Microsoft Word keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult especially shiftA
Overall a 8525 when they first came out like two months ago right after christmas
I bought my great allaround pocket PC in this generation
I upgraded to a it might have problems time to time and some getting used to
I love my phone though 2gig memory card and also have the GPS service
Overall this was the best purchase for the price I ended up spending almost 900
but I also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and some other features
I would like to i dont blame the phone after all it has windows mobile 5 in it
Yes you do have to restart the device it does get hung but see the iPhones operating system though
The restart has that it has windows The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have
Other than the fact occurred twice to me in the past week So be careful
If you take this phone be ready to the phone i suggest that you get this software Spb Pocket plus
Once you buy take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature
It helps shutting down softwares running in the background and adds more features
The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features
Sorry Microsoft but by reading the reviews that it might not work so for the price I gave it a shot
I bought this cable knowing you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too
This USB cable was a replacement for my other cable and installed all the drivers on winXP if you dont have susteen driverssoftware you can obtain the drivers for the USB cable for your phone from their website free download
Since I already had DataPilot susteen software already installed as soon as I plugged it into my computer with the phone attached it saw it as a susteen USB cable that was used as a chew toy by my dog
I never used the installation CD that came with this USB cable and I installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes it also works with the DataPilot software but I like using BitPIM software for my VX830
i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id
if you havent activated your tracfone email and i will send you a fast referral
please send me an yet then the refer a friend program will give each of us 100 free minutes
Once i got the phone activated I havent had any problems
Tracfone has a refer a friend program that will give each of 100 free minutes
All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral
Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things
Just unscrew the tip of one so when you do there it is
You never know when youll need the stylus and youve got a pen
It also blends came promptly and I am happy with the quality
The product in well with the design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactilely
However fitment wasnt perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo
Not a huge problem but something I would feel everytime I reach for the stylus
But the pen works definately recomment this product to others
I would pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands
This is the original provides all that it should as a charger for the V188
Fully functional and and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy
Fried my original one when steep for such and inexpensive item
Shipping was a little used it abroad with wrong voltage
I definetly will continue to kind of stuff between the screen and the protector
Kind of difficult to place without getting some do business with Amazon and A1 Accessories
I recently bought a Nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones
However the Nokia CA53 cable was around 50 dollars
So far everything this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the CA53
I would highly suggest buying that I have used it for is working flawlessly
This product helps good job shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them
Eforcity really did a you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone
Comes with an unlabeled cd couldnt tell any 1st party software you need though Im sure a Google search would be just as easy
It also has links to one side from the other that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones arent labeled in any helpful way
I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect
The belt clip is very strong making accidental unclipping rare
The pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts
The front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets
The bottom of the case has a having to remove the phone from the case
This allows you to silence calls without small hole for access to the Chocolates End button
The only dislike I have is the name Cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really a big deal
I would recommend this case to anyone who owns a Chocolate
Ive had this going to have to send it back because I thought it was too small for my phoneI have an LG CU500 from Cingular
When I first got the case I thought I was case for under a month but its working great
The case has since seemed to stretch a little so but the drivers on the provided CD are pretty much worthless
The computer recognizes my phone when I plug it in it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out
I needed a Razr it but I love it It is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my Razr phone
I did not think I would even use Car Charger and the Crystal Clear Hard Shell Case was included with the purchase
There are stick on belt doesnt ruin Razrs stylish look a single bit
a nice bonus hard shell case that clips that work fine with this
The charger wasnt very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable
I wasnt interested in the case but after I got it I found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal
Eventually prices will is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card
Reception is crystal clear and it be free like the motorola Razor V3
Video and voice with TMobile so your mileage may vary
Im using it recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera
In my opinion its runs pretty well although I did experience some lags and software freezes with thirdparty apps
The Symbian 9 OS a featurepacked phone at a reasonable price for an unlocked smart phone at least
I think the menu organization could be default screen displays your days calendar agenda
I do love that the smarter but you can customize much of it
Photos with the a phone first and not a camera there is also no stabilization control
Since this is 3megapixel camera are grainy it also has a VGA camera
Your friends family and colleagues will hear you clearly
On your end however it will sound like youre talking on a cell phone
Its not bad but Ive commenter about wireless internet WLAN access
I disagree slightly with another had conversations on better sounding phones
The problem is that if you to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider
One way around it is arent at that location regularly you will have to search for a new network
I agree however that some while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first
The metal cover pops off fairly easily as I found out kind of onebutton autodetect would be ideal
The phones slider open something thats hard but not impossible to do accidentally unlocks the keypad
By default sliding the phone completely form factor moves smoothly perhaps too much so
Its 5way controller button also looks and predictive text feature is solid and sensible
The upshot is that the feels a bit cheaper than youd probably expect
When enabled it works contextually on automatically for but a few annoyances mean its far from The Perfect Phone
Overall I give this phone high marks for features SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs
I got this phone 2 weeks the box the phone is quite impressive
Just right off back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back
Many complain about the response time yes this phone is slow but doesnt bother me far better than my windows machine Overall very good phone for what it offers
This phone tops in ergonomics ease of use presentation features Bluetooth speakerphone and call quality
Nokias connection that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots of money
It handles very efficiently manager is far superior than anyone else in the market
I accidentally downloaded a apps that come with this phone are quite good
All the big chunk of data and going to pay through my nose next month
Also I transfer Mass storage mode when it is connected to PC which is pretty neat
The phone automatically toggles to musicthemesringtones using data cable from my Wintel
I havent faced uncharged and it comes for 23 days good enough for my call volumes
I also tried leaving it any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily
Having the wifi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while youre at home and then use it wisely while you are away
Camera settings are similar to professional cameras very very impressive
Battery life as many claim seems short but I charge my gadgets daily so not a big issue
The headset that comes with the phone is really good
Tonnes of themes apps etc available for this phone
My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed
It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I selected an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left
My second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on the screen light does not come up
So you wont know even in the day which button to press to answer you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get
The picture what you see on the screen when the question Unlock phone you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain
There is a hope if there would be some sw patch for this
I sincerely serious lag between the shutter click and the final image
I am anyway not a far superior camera quality I saw so far
That is one big fan of phone cameras with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i
I am putting this on the would need a small app to do the locking properly
So you bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing
At this point to be a very good phone but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800
I think this is going Nokia has better phones like N95 etc of course very expensive
well I many as you want so it should be considerably less on Amazon
all day as called NokiaUSA direct and regular retail from them is 499
I recieved good customer service keep this phone with my network
Thanks for allowing me to and excellent help from these guys
I didnt want to give it up just yet and you have a dropped call and reception is excellent
My V180 is through Cingular I never allowed me to get another phone just like the one I had
Long Battery life very easy menuswayfinding and small size
No frills like MP3 player or camera however just a very good phone
Ive had this phone calls which is really all I ask for from a phone
It is good for making for a year and a half with no problems
It is easy enough excellent service in the NY tristate area and because it is a quadband phone Ive also been able to use it while roaming internationally
My carrier is Cingular and Ive had to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and theyve had no problems
Battery life is recharge every other day with normal use
I have to just okay not as good as my old Nokia
Overall its lasted me doesnt spend HOURS on the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you
If youre the type of person that long enough that I would call it a good value
I bought this phone only gripe about this phone in the US is the price I wouldnt pay over 40 bucks for it
I would say that the in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great
The screen possible that the stuff would actually work for such a low price
It didnt seem is a colored one and it has cool ringtones
Even though fits great and it hasnt cracked at all
The case shipping was steep it was still worth the money
Both chargers work great I think maybe my the car charger alone verizon wanted 24
just for phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it but I cant complain I would highly recommend this package
the plastic cover for the weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality
The chargers might feel a little light phone is very good as the razr phone scratches pretty easily
Helps reduce clutter and now I can actually close my cup holder tray Acura RDX
It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended it doesnt get in the way like the spiral cords do
I never measured the and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better
You go to your service provider store and buy a car charger cord when extended but it is much longer than most
The retractable cord is an awesome feature you for about 2 months and I am still happy with it
Ive had it can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular or sprint stores
It has a little blue led light in the console when I am not using it and it seems to charge the L6 just fine No complaints with the devise or the service from Amazon
I like the way it doesnt take up space that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but I like it
ive had this charger for the highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone
It is last couple of months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it
Car charger serves it purpose make sure you plug the connector in the right way
You just need to it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter
I would have liked some type of label short but have had no functionality issues
The cord is a little that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device
It was exactly what I my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of serviceso it was time
I purchased this battery becuase needed and works as well as one that would have cost me 20 or more in the stores
It does last longer and an audiovox 8910 cell phone and you need an replacementthis is the one
I have no bad reviews about this so if you have Im glad I bought this battery
It is the standard Palm battery meaning it is Blackberry Rim email service battery life is notably reduced
Note also that when using Bluetooth andor the probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device
The solution would be lower device with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first day
It installed very easily consumption or a bigger capacity battery neither of which appear possible at the moment
It has far out performed and put when traveling in areas you are not familiar with
This navigation system is truly a useful tool to shame the more expensive bulkier unit it replaced
I did a lot of looking case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use
The Krusell before purchassing a Krusell and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch
Cosemetically it looks great with professional attire or with my blackberry so I bought this then since I take my phone every where but not my wallet This salved the problem
I used to forget my wallet but I always had casual clothing The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards This is an excellent product
This is good for people it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one
I love this case because who forget their wallet or phone but remember to bring the other
It is just recommend it if you like carrying less stuff
I highly nice to have to keep up with one less thing
These are well worth the money at your phone battery to see if its the same shape
Take a look for your Nextel Phone Although it may not list it from Experience these batteries fit 95 of all the Nextel phones
The color twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store
They are a good will be different as these have a white cover
Plus these were NEVER used before Unlike the celluar store battery these batteries come in a box with the battery in shrink wrap so you know the battery has not been used
When you buy then in the cellular store they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed and youd never know it plus there is no shrink wrap Ever buy a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months Hmmm I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one Would you know
These batteries are well worth it Buy one or two extra to keep charged in perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack
This charger works case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days
It is very affordable and much pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery
This is a great little desktop charger less expensive than buying with the phone
However it seems expensive for what you get not to mention the fact that what the text doesnt tell you is that you need an additional expensive serial cableadapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable
Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price
and just place the small it is compare to the pictures i saw online
i couldnt believe how phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges
however one bad it to anyone whos thinking about buying one
i would recommand thing about that is that i lost it already
When I lost my Stylus I had a difficult time finding a replacement
Product is great for products such as Samsung cell phone models A630 A850 A950 A970 A930 A990 A645 and A870
The thin adapter makes this charger Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one
I originally bought another very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office
I returned the other one because this one great product for a great price Delivery was quick too
Its a worked just as good if not better It actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer
It fits like a glove and material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer
Made of interesting flexible protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases
All buttons of the easily remove and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of your waist
The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and phone are accessible through the case
You cannot covers the phones screen is a little to far from the surface of the phones screen
The clear plastic screen that access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case
This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen
The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but Im not sure
On the positive side you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and for text but not for pictures
The screen is perfect still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online
Sorta confusing use it like a typical pilot where you write on the screen
I expected to to use if not familliar with palm pilots
Good reception great sound functions I needed phone calendar camera etc
The Treo600 has all the quality Speakerphone is great Neat features
1 the screen is not good for viewing pictures but thats what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo650
2 the phone failed to dial two times in two months
I had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem
This is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen
It has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare as new and the sticky side stays sticky
Ive washed mine it comes out clean but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on
Just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place
It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bend it IT WILL NEVER GO BACK
Durable thick to wash it yet so I havent tried out that feature
I havent had doesnt interfere in any way with the touch screen
But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these its been totally worth it to me hey after spending hundreds on your Treo whats a few dollars
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything youve normally seen
Typically 95 of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible
When the screen is off you see the bubbles on the screen hope against hope that you dont have bubbles but you almost always do
BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal
And because of those properties they go on with NO bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time
Further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good
This is the state of the art for screen protectors
And this all becomes an and quality of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
Because of the thickness even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will get dulled and scratched
I had it up free software to use with the cable
I downloaded BitPM and running in minutes with my LG VX8600 Verizon
I just followed the installation phone in BitPM to have it automatically find the phone
I clicked on discover instructions that came on the CD that comes with the cable
I didnt even need to go and look for the com port as the installation says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phone
When installing make sure you pick the right driver
if you have is in the description they dont state the length of the cable
My only complaint XP choose the XP driver not the NT or Win98 or other driver
My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly
I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall
I projected the cable to be about 6 feet 3 feet long otherwise everything is fine
This cable is only about and if you do yourself youre in for a surprise
The description doesnt state this shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated
On a better note but the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models which really helped me
I have a to say about it really it does what it should
Not much VX9900 enV and this cable works great with it in conjunction with BitPIM
got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install
Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everything awesome deal for 3 bucks
No synchronization software is included so you have to use a thirdparty tool like bitpim
I ordered this cable on December 1st got it on the 8th
It came with drivers but I LGVX9900 and to my surprise it charges too
The cable fit perfectly with my didnt need it because I found drivers online
I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525 and have had a few problems wit
First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt
Second the aluminum case isnt the sturdiest so now its sort of bent referring to the hinge I guess Ive been really rough on my phone but I just bend it back to where its supposed to be referring to the hinge
my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it
When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted bought my wife one when she got her phone
I actually liked it so much I a new clip instead I recieved a full refund so that was a pleasant suprise
The K790a is currently the best Cybershot camera phone in Sony Ericssons lineup but more are on the way and also handsdown the best camera phone in the U
Its too bad that SE doesnt sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside
But the but like many professionals will tell you pixel count is only one thing
Sure its only 3MP K790a is very capable as a digital camera
This 3MP camerainaphone takes betterlooking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar Aptech sp Samsung and other offbrand companies
My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card I was simply blown away by the quality
Of course I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality but the results still far exceeded my high expectations
I dont care for the MMS features because my prepaid service Speak Out Wireless doesnt support them
I just camera phones in Japan including models from Casio now have optical zoom but the truth is of course that if you need serious picturetaking you still use a real digital camera
I wish there were optical zoom more and more download them to my PC using a USB card reader
But this year and upgrade to SEs next gen next year hopefully by then theyll have released optical zoomequipped K phones
Ill use this for a comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam
Reception is pretty for a phone MP3 player could use a little help
Pictures are amazing good on the TMobile Cingular networks used by Speak Out Wireless
Screen is beautiful and as background will not notify be able to notify you unless the program is open
The phone is Java 2 compliant however many programs that run in the always menu interface is a treat
Very other than the MP3 player and impressed with excellent cam it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors
purchased the phone about 3 months like the nice QVGA screen and Java notification issues the phone is a 5
the phone has good reception at least on par with W810
voice call is OK but as other users stated the level is kinda low esp speakerphone firmware upgrade R1KC001 will help
the operation is standard SE style if well with TMobile internet it can play local mp3 VBR supported wma asf audio rename the extension to
the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio still used by BBC and it works you are familiar youll be OK without reading manual
wma realaudio but well it works with ALL bt equipment I have including wireless headphones
bluetooth works pretty I wish it supports ogg vorbis which is the audio format I use
logitech headphones users please read handle regular html sites as well as simplified html and wap sites
web browser can in order to make the headphones works properly you need to go to bt menu and connect from there
the phone is kinda bulky and lot of functionsfeatures are pretty appealing it lacks something its supposed to have
though the phone has a bulge on cam cover but its pretty comfortable and firm to hold making messaging is a good pleasure
quadband this is not acceptable for this price even format support ogg vorbis streamimg wmaasf shoutcast
music player should have more file many lower models have quadband K550 W610 W580 W810 Z710 W710
m2 memory card though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB PSP card is a lot cheaper
QVGA screen and it shows clock when the phone is idle
low earpiece and screen and cam go for it however if you travel a lot settle with quadband models theyre cheaper
conclusion if you want a phone with excellent speakerphone level though firmware upgrade will fix
Ive had 3 cell phones prior to this one all Motorola and I really thought they were all pretty good phones
However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water Its very compact and durable you can tell it was made with an incredible level of quality control
This is why I bought the phone now I am never without a camera
The flash is good and strong so it takes great pictures with good focus
I dont VERY disappointed that it wouldnt allow me to use mp3s as ringtones
However I was really use the mp3 feature because I have an iPod
I heard this was because my service provider is a jackass and not the phones fault though
With a little bit of forum browsing I was able to hack my way around this if you have this problem email me at skibum2801yahoo
now I have my if Im simply using my home phone its so great
I feel as very own custom ringtones that come out as clear as day with the nice speaker
The buttons took a little bit to cant get a subsidized version via a carrier
Pity you get used to because I was a Motorola girl for so long but I picked it up quickly and now I have no issues
Super easy to upload the US which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology
This is a top selling handset in Europe but tricky to get hold of in pictures straight to Flickr via phone
Coming from a SonyEricsson T637 I was familiar with the SE UI so getting used to this phone was relatively easy for me
I love the camera it takes amazing pictures and the music player serves my needs just fine
Support for a memory card is a huge extensive customization in terms of shortcuts and themes ringtones and so forth which is another plus
This phone also allows for plus I have a 1 GB Sandisk M2 Micro card and now I never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos
As far as negatives for the phone I only have a few minor ones the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet and the camera lens cover sometimes slides open in tar pasar 2 meses leyendo Reviews en mil paginas
Es el mejro celular q pude encontrar my pocket but neither of these would convince me not to get this amazing phone its quite possibly the single best phone Ive ever owned Definitely very happy with this purchase
mp un screen de colores hermosos radio videos movies mp3 bluettoth memory card buenos acesesorios incluidos Es el mejor celular del mercad
EDGE device makes internet data fairly quick and usable as PC modem via bluetooth
camera lens cover needs a lock switch mine opens just walking bit quick and should be adjustable
sleep timer is a around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket very annoying
I shouldnt expect it thinner since it is the size really helps taking night pictures
The xenon flash of a very small digital camera but Id still like it slimmer
I use to own and other several fucntion that i havent used yet
It has autofocus the w800i and this one takes way better pictures
I love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phone
It also very easy to navigate through the phone functions
My computer had no i have about this phone is the headphones
The only complains problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded
Walkman series have way better headphones is the expensive memory stick micros
Another complain so when you get this make sure to buy new headphones and adapter
and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned
It has also replaced my camera and I am now never without a camera
I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited
They dont give the phone a second glance not realizing its got the 3
I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows
After throwing in a 1GB memory stick I think it was 79 it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300 pics right now
The movie function rocks too however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject
The sound playback of on the USB cable it pops up instantly as another drive just like the camera
If I throw it the movies is fantastic though so at least concert videos make for good listening
If I dont care about viewing allows me to use their software to move things around
The bluetooth connection the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone I dont even take it out of my pocket
Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a clarity is no issue at all good signal no dropped calls etc
The contact list is easy to work with the call Modem which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program
It needs charging with the USB plugged in it also charges
Charges slower but about every 3rd day charges very quickly
The only thing I can think to complain have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes
If I want 100 I about is that when using the USB cable to charge it only wants to charge it to 89
I paid 14 as much for this product and a timely manner and functions properly
The product was delivered in it works just as well as the name brand product
The photo of photo have a Treo Logo and the producto dont have i
The side case in the this Premiun Side case is not at the Photo
I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car
The clip just wouldnt grip my belt securely enough
I gave up after the thing in my left pocket but that doesnt work so well with some pants especially jeans
Most of the time I just slip the 3rd time my Treo 650 hit the concrete
I decided to try find it easy to get the phone in and out of the case
The clip is strong and I the Treo leather case and I like it quite a bit
This is the third case I flapping piece of leather that cost 35 and was totally useless
My first case had a tried for my Treo 650 and its simplicity is its key to success
My second skin had a belt clip that whenever I bent over to tie my shoes to use easy to wear and gives excellent protection
This well designed Premium Side Case is easy for example the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor Simply bad design
When the phone is in vibrate when worn with a suit and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt
Its small enough that its not a problem mode you are always aware when you get a call page or email
Good design is Treo 600 with the original case that came with the device
I used to carry my always fashionable and the case is well made
But soon I found out on a carpet so no damage at least no visual damage
Luckily it was that the original case is kind of loose and my Treo fell out from it once
After that incident I started looking for a better case and this one is what I found
What can I say you dont know how bulky Treo is until you wear one on your belt
The case does its job it provide a nice and heavy and its thick so you will definitely aware your Treo is hanging on your belt
But Treo is quite secure protection for Treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway so you dont have to carry it around with your hand or in you pocket which barely fit
And sometime I just feel like still prefer to have this than the original case
But overall I its too much a burden and I want to get it off me
And the heaviness is not this cases fault is that I have to remove it from the case to use it
This case is great for protecting my Treo but the downside should blame Handspring now PalmOne for not making it lighter
I purchased it because I had actually dropped my Treo your time looking for another case this is the best
Dont waste when walking with it balanced on my portfolio now I clip it to the portfolio and it is secure and safe and I dont run the risk of leaving it behind
How come phone make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit
The only negative comment that I will accessories dont qualify for prime shipping How are they different from other electronics
Amazon has the best and secure enough not to fall off and get lost
The fit is snug price for the case and it is well worth the price
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly perfectly and I couldnt be happier
It fits my Treo 650 what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
I have used this product for about thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
As others have noted it does increase the four months and had another brand prior to that
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this are under the skin but easy to press
The function buttons unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications ease of use and good handling
It gives good protection GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
Only disadvantage is that formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
This was custom you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
My one complaint is more attention to the pictures and thought about it
I should have paid they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
The 700w and p if you is the same but they different icons and purposes
The button layout dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
Well the skin has images on the theres a way to remove these somehow
Im going to see if button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Driver install was easy and Bitpim access works just fine
The cable I received also charges the phone VX8300 from Verizon
I agree with was easy and with the Bitpim program you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently
The price was right set up previous reviewers Gely ZenCity regarding this cable
I loaded my whole Outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones
Dont waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from Verizons sites VCast and such just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the musictones that you already own
You will likely need some type of additional software to actually DO anything with the phone
I ordered this cable two of them actually to use on the LG 8300
The driver disc contains software find on the internetto transfer data to the phone
I used bitpim a free program you can for the 8300 only not the 5300
I was unable to locate a data cable the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300
All in all I recommend locally and was happy to find one on Amazon even though it was only available through a third party
For those wishing to use it on driver that I knew worked so I did not use the disc
However I already had a the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to be no driver included for your phone
Product is excellent and does all it is supposed to do
I was very pleased when I got this cell phone case
I was really frustrated with my phone before purchasing this case
I kept on getting the screens dirty every time I made a call
It feels good it while they are supposed to not touch dads phone it has an almost 100 chance of getting dropped sooner or later
It protects my phone I have two boys and has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth
Like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the camera a little but not a big deal camera is not so hot anyhow
I have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best
The rubber suit covers every bit of the phone so I am confident that I wont be getting any scratched
You can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched
There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isnt going to fall out
3 minor qualms The see through plastic has a little glare on it especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suit
Also it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock
noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt
Last the flap sort is crap for its specs but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap
You already know the v710s camera of comes into the field of view of the camera
I just solid and professionally made not some cheap import special
It feels got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice
I like the blue LED light instead of the typical red dot
Also the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging
The IC chip is important so that you your out of luck if youre using the extended battery for your A920 phone
The only problem is that it can only hold the standard battery so dont overcharge your phone battery and shorten its life
Other than that telephone gets loose very often elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily
top part of its a very nice and stylish case for the Samsung A920 phone
I have a 6255i phone and used the XP worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately
Installation was seemless and the drivers from cable to connect to a windows XP home system
Downloaded the Nokie suite software from the wanted 50 bucks for the same cable
Cellphone companies Nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine
Use this faster than expected I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow
The cable came one you will save money and its the same cable
The cable came with the software driver best price by far and the service was excellent
Electro Island had the although I did not need it and worked great with my already installed Nokia Sync software
The silicone protective covering my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
It fits for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
I have used this product for about thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
As others have noted it does increase the four months and had another brand prior to that
But the phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I have dropped my thickness gains you considerable protection
I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a good protection ease of use and good handling
It gives bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep curve bump and button on the Treo
This was custom formed for every it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
My one complaint paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
I should have is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes
Well the skin to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
Im going has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Bluetooth cannot and fast to order and the person I bought it from seemed to make it easier
I was so easy be accessed when the phone is in the pouch
I have had buy stuff online when now I can download it straight to my PC
I dont need to no problems with charger and am very happy with my purchase
makes it easy to transfer Pictures videos ring tones contact numbers
My original charger broke that caome wit the cell phone
I was going to go buy a charger but they cost like 30 if you get the name brand
This one I purchased does the trick and saved me lots of money
I have a Sony Ericsson charge I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98
While it does Z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand charger I got with the phone
I am unsure however if this is the stock holster that comes with the phone
This holster is by far better than because my battery is less effective than when new
It has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt
It is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holster
The thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy inout
This item cost 1 penny of course the shipping was 4
84 but I thought it was weeks and it hasnt broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally
Ive had it for two a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores
Order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters
This belt clip was exactly what I was looking for and the price was great
If I could change one thing the and I just love it I am very new to all this fancy cell phone stuff the last one I had was bare bones basic
Ive had my new Nokia 5300 for about a week now swivel action is just a little looser than I would like but definatly not a problem
It is great having a phone that you can do so much with
The camera is so handy since I never remember to take my other camera anywhere with me and the mp3 player and radio are also great to have
The music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it a one cent phone with free shipping and 75
You just cant beat I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadnt made up my mind until I saw this phone and what an awesome deal it was
00 in rebates TMobile had my old Net10 phone number ported to the new phone in 2 days The customer service people have been so nice and the ability to buy ringtones wall paper and myfaves icons right on the phone from TZones is awesome
I also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account plan info right on the phone
The only issue I have been having is finding accessories for the best multimedia phone so far on the market at least until the iPhone will show up then the game is on again
yes its a tie with the Sony Cybershot K790a for itmy usual discount accessory shops dont have much yetIm assuming because the phone is so new but Im sure that will get resolved soon
i am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile Verizon travel charger you get a travel charger home charger and a USB cable with driver CD
For less than the cost of an offical contract for 2 more years and get this phone for 100 or drop my previous one and get a new contract
The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use Windows Media Player to move music over to your phone using the Sync feature and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file transfers between your PC and phone
Some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine but they were unable to get the data cable to work
However I found no such problems just search the web for a program called BitPim
After installing the drivers and successfully used the data cable to transfer files off of my phone
Its not exactly the nicest looking software but gets the job done
I got the a data transfer cable the house and car charge cheaper than what I would have paid for the car charger alone
I have been using this piece for the last one year and its quite a decent one
It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed
An ample problem with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by T mobile
I recently had a speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handy at times
If you want a cell phone that is well is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that I dont want
It has enough features to keep things interesting but made looks good feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the V360 is an excellent choice
it also looks and feels good was sold unlockedunbranded and it was of the quadband variety
I bought my V360 on eBay and it and is thus a pleasure to use
Durability this thing was built a dozen times and theres barely a scratch
I must have dropped this thing with the clumsy in mind like me
MP3 player I agree that the onboard MP3 player is a feature you will actually USE and the sound quality is good
That being said the 5MB of memory is a joke but with the cost of TranshFlash memory coming down I bought my 512MB chip on eBay for 7
Ive had no problem with playing my iTunes to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either program to rip to mp3 format you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menu
Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats you need music as long as theyre mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality then it will play fine
Programmable smart keys I read where known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the Personalize menu
He must not have one user complained that the camera button was not on the side it was the camera icon button on the front keypad
Not only that but you these features outofthe box but theyre for the time when these technologies are more commonplace
You may not use can rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps
I use my Bluetooth for my wireless 900 1800 and 1900 GSM networks although that has not been personally tested
This phone works on 850 headset and for syncing and adding files mp3s pics etc to my phone with my laptop
However I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and Ill know for certain by then
Theres a slight delay when you answer a call I usually have to say hello 23 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak
I dont know while charging even when the phone is powered off
The light stays on if this is a carrier problem or the phone
You really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone
It has a monochrome outer display full color inside
This doesnt bother me at all but its not as flashy as Razr or other phones
This is a great durable little phone with handy features I think people will actually use
Ive read where people complain well designed user friendly and doesnt look like a trickedout teenagers phone then this is the phone for you
If you want a good quality cell phone thats about the picture quality but thats what a digital camera is for
As usual Motorola provides simple to use reliable that you should invest the time to the read the manual
Other reviewers are correct equipment but this is not all its more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal
My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory
Despite having something like five Meg of memory on the phone and a Micro SD memory card thats it
The size of the text message doesnt seem to matter
This is a great phone that Ive used for a year now
Id like to highlight the standout features that make this phone unique especially at its price
Just get an adapter for the usb port a few bucks on eBay and you can plug in your stereo headphones
Too bad they SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtone cropping it will make it more effective 3GP videos animation looks great but the sound was slightly out of sync search the web for video converters to convert your content or pictures
You can take a MicroSD card put it into the included adapter and plug into an havent offered an update to the Motorola Digital Audio Player
I love Explorer 320 headset for 20 and it works great with it
I got an making my own ringtones and not having to buy them
Easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one
The battery life isnt very long so its good to have a spare battery theyre cheap
Not high quality video but its something the old RAZR couldnt do
You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the top of the keypad and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone
It even make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper
You can easily has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features
Also you can find replacement systems and when youre put on hold
Good for using automated phone menu faceplates to make your phone unique
The speaker is loud resonate at certain sounds though
The plastic may and great for ringtones and mp3s
VIBE THEN RING Why is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket
The vibration doesnt every phone have this It should be the default standard for all phones
If you are one to show off your ringtone
let it move onto ring otherwise be descreet and answer immediately
All the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off
I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit
I scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldnt look half worn off

All the great features just has all the feefree features you could want
This phone is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509 or other more expensive phones
if the cell is in this Motorola HS805 headset and find it more than adequate
I recently purchased my back pocket jean the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up
The ability of rechargable batteries are a gimmick
Nonreplacable using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect
So you throw ear structure the fit can be either formfitting or loose
Depending on your your headset and charger away and buy a new one
From reading the other device it pairs to would make a difference in performance
Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or reviews here one can infer this
Some reviewers here and others we experienced no such problem
For me felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static
Best bet is to check the return policy if you find that it doesnt meet your standards
But if it works for your device you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talk time on 1 AAA Alkaline battery
And you will never be bothered with a charger unless ear comfortably then you have a winner
If it also fits your you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea
I can use it daily for an hour or so that this can vary a lot
It appears from other reviews every day on a single AAA for at least two weeks
I use this headset I can use it as a generic output device
On the Apple with both a Treo 650 phone and a Apple PowerBook G4
The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about the person on the other end is not talking very loudly then its sometimes hard to hear
like driving or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing fullblast OR if 30 feet away on the Treo 650 the signal is not nearly as good
the call goes back to my but thats really your first clue about the battery
You can milk it a while longer cell phone when the battery is getting low
The earpiece in a gust you may want to hang on to it
If youre outside is OK its not as secure as Id hope
Also people on the other end sometimes can tell Im on a headset with this one they mention that I sound a little staticky
This is my first bluetooth headset so perhaps my rating is higher just because its a nifty gadget
But the battery life on this NiMH AAAs and they just last a really long time with this unit
I use rechargeable is really the winner my workmates have rechargeable headsets and it seems like theyre always having to charge them
I bought this good volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo
The sound quality is headset for internet chats with my husband when he travels for business
I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a charger
All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies
The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear
It would be nice if it bent for a custom fit but I am pretty happy with it
Easy to had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated
Have not pair with my phone Motorola SLVR L7 European Version
Price of talk time before battery has to be replaced
22 Hours affordable but acts like an expensive headset
I would highly recommend this product for those looking for products as they are better than Best
I will only use Krusell a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset
There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest
Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price
It quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button making the whole unit quick and easy to store
I love the retractable cable that works beautifully with my Treo 700p smartphone
The only complaint Ive heard me to turn the device sideways or upside down so the blue glow doesnt shine up into her eyes
It doesnt annoy me but my wife asks is that the large blue power light is too bright at night
The retractable cord keeps it out of the way the weak point is at the connector and they break
My complaint with all Palm chargers is that and it extends out far enough to use the phone
But the price excellent product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hiding its style
This is an on this one is good enough that you should buy 2
I chose Treo because of its unique look and excellent features however the case from Palm didnt work for me along with other items which then scratch it
So it gets thrown in my purse because I use the phone a lot and I dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime
I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phone while in it it hides the Treos real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag
I loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands anyone who are crazy over that color
had a return and better than the old one it replaced
Good battery life certainly much they replaced it no questions asked
For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original
However it doesnt fit quite as snugly in the dockstyle charger that came with my phone not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly
That is a little annoying that it tends to fall out from renewing the contractthus the battery was a contract killer
This battery saved me if Im not paying attention Ill wake up the next morning and my phone wont actually have been charged but it still works
I thought I probably a decent product but it doesnt work in my vehicle 04 Jetta
The product is was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49
I think it has was exactly as advertised charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving
Item arrived quickly and to do with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to long
I couldnt believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price
Everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase
The cable is exactly what I needed were not as complete as I would have liked
Drivers provided on the accompanying CD worked but and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives
I am still very satisfied as it was only the cable that I was really after especially for the price at which I bought it
The vehicle phone charger I received was not the one pictured as for sale
It does however appear it does not work to charge my V170 cell phone
I have now used this product and find that to be equal in features
I have since purchased what it is spposed to do and the price is right
This car charger does the Motorola charger more expensive and it works perfectly
You might have to pay a little longer and pay a little more if I know what I am getting is not just a counterfeit
I am always willing to wait a little bit more but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind
After reading reviews here user forums I decided to purchase this
It can charge a secondary battery in the rear compartment AND can charge
the extended life batteries LED indicator is added benefit wa simple guide
The three color as well while the Q is on the charger
The charger can not overcharge the battery which is an added benefit
And you can easily access the Q while on the charger for SMS texts using any app
or even using the speaker each Motorola Q phone as standard equipment
Motorola should include this with phone while on the desktop charger
Great product cable to connect my Verizon cell phone to my Macintosh so I could transfer and synchronize data
I simply wanted a data works quickly when charging my Moto V555 in the car
Verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on Windows machines
This was a WHOLE lot cheaper than the Verizon dealer wanted for this product
My only disappointment was that it didnt have clear instructions which was LGs fault
cover fits great and for the price i could not find anything better was at the local mall and saw a cover that was the same for around 17
I just bought this thing will last for many months down the tough road
Well I hope this case a few weeks ago and its holding up very well
I would like to buy two or more great and it is very slim fitting so the phone doesnt look bulk
the case looks shells do you offer differents colors to choose from wich colors are there this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee
This was delivered as an OEM product exactly as expected
I bought one of these extended batteries on ebay and was really sorry
I was good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery
This time I got a reluctant to try again but I was glad I did
I only have to charge the new battery every 2 3 days
I have tried a dozen screen guards some of them shine a lot some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble
And yea the best part is for my 8525 is very nice
The touch screen protector its static not gum and its washable
The onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer
If anything does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen easier sad than done
I have had it for some time now I got it for my 11th birthday
I have reviewed the cingular version too even though mines verizon
Very short battery life I have to charge it almost every day
Camera The picture you take cant move or it comes out all messed up
Recording videos Even though you get the color and style My friends are all jealous
Its style I love 15 seconds I still use that to make funny videos with my friends
Personally I think if you are while they may not be as small light and attractive as Motorola phones LG phones are built to last
I have personally owned numerous LG phones and buying any sort of Razr for its functionality you are buying the wrong phone
However if you are just looking for a the LG VX9800 before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c
I previously had cute phone that is easy to carry in your pursepocket and to use just as a nice looking phone this is a great one to own
I had the VX9800 because when I was in college I to call people I wanted a phone that was easier to carry around and was cute
However now that I am in the working world and basically only use my phone would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes
I dont recommend this phone if your phone is your lifeit doesnt do much
However if you are just going to be using it to make calls and send the occasional text its wonderful
The pink color that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeousits almost a purpleypinkish lavendar color
In my opinion this pink is prettier than the TMobile magenta and much much much nicer than the Cingular pink I am not a fan of that one at all
In essence if youre looking for a hightech phone this is not it
If youre looking for a lightweight attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting this is a great buy
I just got my is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones
i love that it pink razr phone and I love it so far
Even though it does not have an antenna on of them werent saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it
I was scared to buy this phone because I read some of the reviews and some the outside that you can see it still it works well
When I first got my Motorola Q I changes and the 1700 mAh battery that is now far in the past
With some setting was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying battery in mid day
A little fatter than the does not comes with 2 screen protector only but also a squeegeem cloth and cleaning instructions
I was suprise it regular battery which means a very tight squeeze in my Qholder but the extra power makes a big difference
This shield got this phone and ask me to buy her an Eforcity screen protector
My friend from HK just fits very nicely over my phone screen
Hes been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up
Its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but I digress
The screen protect works as described it comes once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen
The film has some kind of electrostatic polymer theres no adhesive but with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator
Squeegee help to on the Blackberry especially when Im using it as a phone
It definitely improves the grip get out 1 air bubble that formed
It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse
My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases
Come on guys Women use these items too Also the rubber strip between the screen and the this is a great not bulky case
Other than those two things keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that Ive had this case
it is small and satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone
I am very compact easy for travel but also good for home use
I would recommend this holster belt holster with all the phones ive owned my i530 is no
I use my to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed
This belt holster feels really is that I can use my phone while its in the holster
A big plus well made it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard I use it
works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate and can be used to adapt your lg phone to what ever you wan
An extra Lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone
The desktop charger comes with a second Ion Battery to be dependable nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging
I have found the 750 mah Lithium charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts
It doesnt weakin as charge or recharge your Lithium battery is the most important charge of all
However the first time you did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range
You must let the initial run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come
The deader the battery on its first or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery
I am and I take my phone everywhere with me I have yet to find a place where my phone doesnt have Nextel service
No matter where I have gone in northern Ohio and travel many places around the state
I live on a farm here onto concrete 35 feet below and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud
My phone in particular has been dropped several times once off a grain bin and we use the twoway often to communicate
I am extremely happy with Nextels service and phones
I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also cant complain
I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon Alltel Cingular and Sprint
Its a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged from my experience with Sprint they are terrible with no service anywhere and their phones suck too
I have used the i530 for a little over two years is a list of pros and cons
To simplify your reading here and have had no problems with the unit or with NEXTELs service
Cons A little chunky Lacks up to date features and tech such as color screen external display etc
Pros Durability been dropped off a roof still going strong Looks yellow model Call quality is excellent Good speakerphone Digital 2way is a great feature
The only issue among the cons that is of any real concern my original battery lasts more than a day with moderate use
Even after two years is the battery life but this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones perhaps due to the nature of the iDEN network on which they operate
A pain Slightly but given reviews on NEXTEL posted below my experience with their coverage customer service etc
Please beware of several overly negative the advantages of NEXTEL its worth remembering to charge up more often
Just make sure you do your homework with respect to coverage before you sign up with any wireless company
Go with the one that gives the best coverage in the areas in which you live work or travel
Its always best to actually legit at least as far as I have discovered
NEXTELs maps are pretty put the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone
For two years now I I would rate the service as good not excellent
Over all have not had any problems with my Motorola i530 cell phone which is serviced by TelusNextel
Rarely I will have trouble for roughly under a minute before my phone is once again operational
This problem will normally last getting service in a area where I would normally get a strong signal
Im a daily commuter Canadian server to Nextel an American server and still have the same great reception
My phone doesnt miss a beat it will automatically switch from Telus a between Canada and the United States
The cell phone itself is big bulky heavy and ugly
It does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or video features
It does have a direct connect phone is clear and crisp it will seldom cut out of the conversation
The reception on the feature so you can use your phone like a walkytalky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone
Therefore I did not expect a room to a friend who failed to catch it more then once
I have thrown my phone across the quality of the sound of down loaded music to be so poor
One of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces
On a road trip my phone had fallen off my lap out of the car and sat on the side of the road for three days in the rain
I had recharged I have always gotten service and the battery has not died on me thus far
My phone has never let me down the phone and it worked as expected
The battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderate usage
If you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishment and do not desire all of those new phone gimmicks this phone is for you
i have this very well I keep this in my car so when I travel I dont have to worry about my Palm TXs batteries
What can I say It works nextel it works verry good im verry happy with it
This is the 5th Palm treo case I have bought need for a top magnet or velcro flap
It holds the treo snugly without the in the last few years and it is the best by far
The clip is metal unlike many 700p but would allow complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it
I was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my Treo of the crappy plastic ones that break alot
In other words I didnt want person you call sounds like they are drunk
There is one complaint sometimes the something that was attached to the Treo permanently
I have the i850 but tried Theres only 3 things I dont like about it it doesnt have a very big screen the external screen isnt color and it has no camera
The phone is so good my 2 year old cant destroy it hes the i560 is what my wife has been using for about 3 months
Other than that its pretty much the have the same electronics inside minus the 3 things I mentioned above
and holding them together I suspect that they in fact same as the higher priced models like the i850
If you dont take pics this really is the phone for you priced models have minus the camera and a smaller screen
Its everything the higher You can even submerge this thing in water and it will still work without needing anything special It has GPS built in and all the java apps
Even though i560 is nicely sized easy to use and indestructible
The Motorola the screen is smaller its color and very legible
These features are than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones such as the i710 but it is the unbreakable model with outside display
Not only is the i560 smaller what to look for when looking for a new cell phone
Size is important especially with Nextel because most of in between massive and tiny
The i560 is perfectly their early models are very big and awkward like the i710
This is nice because which helps when it comes to using the direct connect placing calls and receiving calls
It is equipped with gripping as well it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas
It is nice looking but the i710 because there is no gripping
More damage is done to is harder to keep in your hand
If however the i560 does a concern due to extreme durability
Dropping this phone is not slip out of your hands dont worry
If you are worried about is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicity however the big difference is in the outside display on the i560
The ease of use between the i560 and the i710 scratching the outside get a leather or plastic cover for it
Without even opening the phone you can place a word where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspect but an improvement is better than nothing
The i710 speaker phone cuts out every third call by pushing the stop butt at the top of the phone and scroll through your most recent calls
There is nothing worse than having to take a cell phone in for repair or even worse having to replace it
As much use as most people get out of their cell phones how it stands up to daily wear and tear is vital to satisfaction with a phone
The i560 is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel and is exceptionally tough
When the i710 is dropped it often goes to a blank screen and causes problems with reception and service
Overall performance mass Cingular so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do
My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with and resilience of the i560 surpasses the i710
Heres a breakdown of the pros and cons so far after a week
Nextels Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear
Any call either DirectConnect or regular call the flip closed and call any of them
You can scroll through recent calls with can be made with the flip open or closed
If youre concerned about radio RF radiation and you should be even to be even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system very impressive
The speakerphone is as loud as you need it though nobody talks about it anymore this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you and improves the transmission
There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone full duplex
You can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to
The phone is a little to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my mediumsized hand
Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy wider than some phones like the V60 but is very light
Phone has slight hourglass shape wider at the bottom to fit nicely into the hand
Phone has all the standard stuff I love and couldnt live without voice dialing custom rings for calls from my contact list handsfree long recent calls list up to 20 ability to store number to Contacts from recent calls without having to key the number just have to enter the name
The phone is almost completely made of plastic be an overreliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone
While Motorola makes truly awesome phones I worry there might and Ive never thought plastic was as durable as metal
When the phone is in the holster the outside display is not visible forcing me to remove the phone to using my phone as a watch
Very annoying as Im used from the holster to see whos calling for those that dont have a custom ring configured or to check the time
The icons on the outside display are small and those who are are clear the battery important and datetime
The only two parts that overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons
The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone to put back and have it cover the slot completely because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec
Its easy enough to pop off but sometimes takes persuading where you connect the charger etc make me think that someday Im going to look down there and find it missing
OVERALL I really like the well made based on the requirements
The cover design is phone and highly recommend it to all
The problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the case
In my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides
Im a heavy user of GPS Applications forget to plug it in at night and I still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day
I used to charge the phone twice a day now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even and Power Vision for websurfing on the go
Even when i huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone
This battery is a forget to charge it hasnt died on me
Talk time and internet time are increased greatly
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast
Though that it is as good as the one Sprint sells for 60 dollars
I have no idea if is still better than the original battery
I just bought this battery at a today and buy it online here
Im going to return it Sprint Customer Service store and I paid 64
Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900 making it less highmaintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing headset using and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time
Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind
Its been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars
What Aside from the piddling cost of this battery which is about double the tax youd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside
To me this is not insignificant but is complaint I had about my a900 was the battery life
The only ignorable as it doesnt detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing talking or using the buttons
I am on conference calls a am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly
With this extended battery I lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly
Totally worth the 15 plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping
The Samsung A900 is a great phone a Motorola Razr on steroids
BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL You literally have to charge this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time
NOT ANY MORE The Bargaincell price was so low I was skeptical
PERISH THE THOUGHT the phone PERFECTLY as did the COVER it came with
It fit I got the battery on time it was VERY well packaged
I then used is a somewhat thick battery it is SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE It does NOT add the bulk you might think looking at its picture
BY THE WAY Even though this the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge WHOO HOO BRAVO BARGAINCELL
In fact I think the phone carry case designed for the RazrA900
I have a leather Bytech actually looks BETTER with the larger battery
Its a tight fit now but thing about it I encountered is the horrid battery life
The only bad Im sure the case will stretch much like a new shoe does after its been worn a few days
And the battery life was a problem phone between 24 times a day
Nobody wants to charge their from the second I walked out of Sprint
With the standard battery I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial
So of course in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times
Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found and I did extensive searching
Also this one comes with the door which is very crucial
Ive seen some extended batteries be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery
You would being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door
What would you do put day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries
Well anyway now that I have this battery my phone will last all a rubber band around it Heck no
My A900 is still very thin even this battery and you will enjoy all its features without dying
Dont worry youre phone will still look great with with this extended battery that sticks out a little
I initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained aboutuntil I applied the the battery when the device is in standby mode
The camera may continue to draw power from FIX Palm has identified that the Treo 680 device can experience reduced battery life when the camera is used
Treo 680 users should months Including Cingular HTC 8125 and Nokia E62 and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned
I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 install the Treo 680 Camera Update to address this issue
The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating the phone very user friendly
Very customizable interface making system albeit less powerful and much more customizable and synchronizationfriendly than the Symbian OS
You can set any advantage of the many features of the phone unlike Windows Mobile which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS but cumbersome and difficult to use at times
Palm OS is easy to use and thus you actually get to take application or any number to dial as a preset button
very important and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear
Perfect size weight for people like me who like to drive and textemail
The lack of with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop
Easy synchronization the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement
Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you which is very useful although limits battery life
Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones
I have to charge my phone every night and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet 30 minutes your email the battery life seems to decrease impressively
If you have it set on autoretrieve for of mp3 player autoretrieve email every 30 min and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions
The newer manufactured device like your iPod headphones you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm
You cant plug in your own headsets into the 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently
I suggest buying this phone a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included
I got it for 350 with unlocked from Palm instead of from Cingular
Also if you get it from Cingular they easy to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter battery life
OVERALL extremely satisfied with this always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone
I had a Palm TX which I loved but which is the best cell phone Ive ever owned
I also had a Moto V557 phone didnt like having to go to WiFi sites for the web
I purchased had to read all of the instructions call customer service and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone
I like the Treo 680 but I the Treo for the best of both worlds
For example I had difficulty answering missed while in a rush to answer the phone
Which I usually the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button
I like the web because its fast enough that I dont miss the WiFi
I had to get used to the fact that many web sites arent small enough for the phone but its excellent for using Google maps looking up business and giving the number for easy dial just tap the blue line checking bank accounts online orders movies weather and especially the news
I absolutely they cant hear me so I now use a corded ear bud
People typically tell me that love the chat setting on the messaging
The Bluetooth doesnt work pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions
You cant insert hard with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately
There is no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial a number
You have to leave the phone dialing page and return to redial
The phone dials other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone
And lastly you cant check your calendar or slowly if there are other programs running
You have to hang up with the person a charger in the car which helps a great deal
The battery life is poor but I keep unlock the phone check the calendar and call them back
I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommend
They are Launcher Xexcellent Mobil Write Treo Voice Dialing The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows
I also recommend found a carrier that will offer insurance on this 400 phone
I have not that you keep you Treo locked with a security password
It had more memory than my a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours
From my research I discovered current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated
1I had to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours
2 I needed to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th
Once I did these two things my phone has me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive
This is a big plus for lasted for a few days without a charge and Ive set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive
Ive had no problems with any of my SD cards or miniSD cards
The increase internal memory also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo
Ive heard the various complaints but you have to work through some of them
Upgrading from the Treo 650 it is true that there isnt much new
Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and nonmegapixel camera leave one frustrated
But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee
So I accept the tell Palm Guys get your act together and come out with something far better
That doesnt mean that I wont current Palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries
I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didnt want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear
I took a chance on this headset even though I read a review saying that it didnt sync up well with the VX8300
Even though it is smallabout 112 the my ear and works well with my VX8300
It also fits snug and comfortabe in buttons are still large enough to use with ease
the headset it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear but its really great and i would buy it agai
the only problem i have with is great works really well with my samsung phone
Well I read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice has been a pleasure to use from the getgo
All I can say is this phone about it after reading some of the reviews here but I decided to take the plunge and go for it
It has its flaws but what phone the gripes others have had just seem little to me
Most of doesnt The question is whether youre going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you
My area has good bluetooth headset Plantronics 510 really well
It also pairs with my Tmobile coverage so I cant complain
99 plan and yes can check my email finds restaurants or directions or just surf the web when Im bored
It doesnt matter where Im at I EDGE isnt the fastest but it gets the job done
It really came to fork out the money for hotspots though
Didnt want in handy when I was out on vacation and lost
No its not going to replace my regular phone arent the greatest so I wouldnt use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headset it sounds pretty good
Mp3Video player Now the speakers on this camera but I found it really handy when I forgot to take my camera to my friends wedding but was still able to take quality pictures
I bought a 2GB microSD card bought here at Amazon and now I can hold a ton music and movies
This thing is my travelinig entertainment center
I even found a way to play original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying Mike Tysons Punchout like back in the old days
Calendarschedule I had a PDA but for some reason Im more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedule on this thing than I did with my Pocket PC
Smartphone applications Im in quickly look up drug references or research diseases
I can the medical field and I keep all my medical applications on this phone
I really thought Id need a touchscreen in order processor were slightly faster for some of these apps but its more than adequate
I just wish the to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus I dont find that its all that necessary and still navigate pretty well
And Im not sure why people dont think with PPC as well as smartphones equally
Programs written for WM5 are compatable there are a lot of programs for the smartphone
Appearance Everyone who sees this phone Q and the Q just looked so much bulkier and
I saw this side by side with the Motorola absolutely loves its looks and so do I
Battery For all that I use this phone for 2 days without charging the battery though
I wouldnt go it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spare which is all I can really ask for
Windows Mobile 5 Mighty Microsoft download for TMobile customer soon so hopefully thatll take care of some of the problems
However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will be free to needs to write a cleaner program
I swear just to turn on the bluetooth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate WM5
Adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best
Luckily my musicvideo programs as well as my that much but I see what everyone says about it and yeah its a pretty idiotic written program
Alarm clock Now I dont use this all stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume so its not such an issue for me
However rather than writing half a page quality phone calls surf the web check email play games listen to music watch movies monitor my schedule check my medical references and take decent quality pictures
Summary So I use this device to make on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now goes on
All this thing needs now is a laser beam that will cut through metal and itd be the greatest gadget known to man
When I got this phone I gave my PDA to my brother and my Razr to my daughter
I love the full contact list with addresses all the phone and that too syncs with Outlook
The calendar is really nice numbers and notes that are in my Outlook and it syncs with Outlook
I dont try to use it for browsing the is you look called and received numbers with one key press extremely easy contact look up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a push or two away
It took some learning to find the easiest way to get to everything but its there internet but I do use Tmobiles Tzones to collect all my email from all my various email address types
It has EVERYTHING that any cell phone one touch or speed dialing is great
The speaker phone is great and has and works as well or better and easier
I can store hundreds of phone numbers at numbers I choose then use service where friends with other providers dont and some areas they have service I dont
Some areas I have the spot number to make a call instead of looking up numbers ie Lees cell is spot 5 home spot 15 office spot 25 I found a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phone
All in all I find email and many other internet based services is only 5 and WiFi service is only 20 monthly cant beat that
If you have Tmobile cell service their tzones for that I have service across the country without much trouble and I drive
The full keyboard makes text messaging and keeping notes MUCH easier and more fun
Its not a full PDA but it does everything I did with my PDA
Its way more than a phone have my camera and it uses a mini SD card which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos
It takes nice pictures for emergencies if I dont really small and thin easy to carry easy to lock and unlock the keyboard
Personally I cant think think its the best cell phone on the market
Its not a laptop computer but I of a negative thing about it
My cousin has the blackberry and hes jealous of me and my Dash
Ive had multiple PDAs that have crashed and multiple phones in the past
I had a great Nokia phone but wanted to combine into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago
Been able to make and receive phone calls call clarity is excellent and with TMobile I have service in my office unlike other coworkers phones
Everyone is jealous their pda phones the email and internet feature
I really enjoy having are much larger and not as nice looking
The only issue Ive had at all works as described and Im very happy with my choice
Everything else is with the volume control when Im surfing the net or playing ball breaker I hold the phone and often hit the volume control
When I was looking to combine my phones I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews I picked this one
This is my first SmartPhone and Ive had a lot of fun with it so far
For being so small the XP along with MS ActiveSync 4
If you have Windows keys are remarkably easy to use
0 your the Dash lets you share the Internet connection granted you have the data plan at no extra cost
A little bonus app on PClaptop will recognize it as a network device
If you get the addon micro SD card comes standard works just as well
Windows Media Player which about 80 youll have no need to buy an iPod
When Im in range doesnt read this since theyll probably patch that loophole
I hope TMobile of wifi I can use Skype and save my minutes
The battery charge doesnt strip on the righthand side drives me nuts
The volume last longer than a day or so if youve got data push to Outlook enabled
When I do but its kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player
You can disable the volume strip an annoying popup interrupts whatever Im doing
A simple classic volume to work right when I really intend to adjust the volume
The strip never seems dial on the side would be a huge improvement
The keyboard is nice many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable
I have tried but a touch screen would be better for certain apps
Right now I have a 140000 word dictionary on it the NIV bible Star Wars many videos of my son about 100 wma songs and a ton of pictures
It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts appts tasks and emails are always up to date
It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset
It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy
I have not found a better than the treo blackberries Q or any other qwerty device
I like it waaaay smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price
The MPT version is Ok but more value is for seem editing for professional and expert users only
The headset works fine people who I talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well but I doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset
After trying this phone out a fitness features flip phone design and the rugged design
What attracted me to this phone were the few days here are my personal results
You have to calibrate it manually if Chocolate Samsung SCHA930 Motorola SLVR L7 and this one blows all of the others out in this category
Ive had other mp3 cell phones LG VX8500 you want the best results but right out of the box its been okay so far
Granted this is not going to contend with the is an upgrade over the Verizon OS
But then I guess almost anything iPod but for a cell phone the Walkman abilities are impressive
The length of the headphones cord is way figure out something comfortable in terms of cord management
Its taken me a few times to too long for running at least for me personally
My hands arent big by any means but I still have trouble with some of the dedicated buttons Walkman Internet Shortcuts Power OnOff
I said I dont use the camera feature often and im glad I dont for this camera
This has the be the most stripped down barebones 2 megapixel camera I have used
Overall I must say that I am satisfied with my purchase Im still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phone
I had the choice between this and the W810i for the same price at the Sony Store to the more powerful world of the Cell Phones
So I welcome myself and I opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and I must say that these two features havent let me down yet otherwise I wouldve gone for the W810
Ive been a fan of Sony Ericssons phones after a Flip Phone and having a Music Player that the phone only had 15MB of space to begin with and to top it off its camera wasnt great
My only thoughts were that despite the phone being Ive seen what they really do and when I had the Z500a long time back when I won the phone during hurricane season I thought the phone was great
I have already made a few quick station buttons on the W710 and the best part is that I W810 and while that phone looks ok the W710 just fits me right
Most people Ive seen the only chance they have is getting the feel original with the fact that Im the only one that has it in my school and among my friends
The phones color scheme the style of the phone the phones technogeekness for those of same as every phone from SE it makes it that much easier to learn the phones buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old Z500
The fact that the phones user interface is for the most part the us who love technology and the fact that many people namely the girls find it a cute phone Dont know weather that is good or not but at least it attracts some attention
With 2GB of expanded memory that I put in it and the phones already 17MB of internal space the phone has want walkman power for mp3s and FM Radio knowing your fitness activity this is the phone for you
So for those needing a nice looking phone many possibilities And the last part before I go is that with the fact its an Active phone you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day check your training and more It even gives you rewards for being active
Note I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710is features work in comparison
I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function
My sons Z500 z710i for my son and will review that one later
Ive also purchased the would work in areas my p910i would not
Excellent to quickly use 4 of your most used features
shortcut buttons voice quality with headsets wired or bluetooth
Ability to buy an international you dont have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big
Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable if SIM card to avoid extra fees
FM radio reception is option to use while on airplane
standard or flight mode soso in the downtown area
The international charger with an adapter for US outlets
Inability to sync with any computer using Windows Vista Im sure a workaround is coming
I havent used the phone and interferring with the antenna I havent had a problem with this
Others have warned about holdling the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounters accuracy
Since I have other Sony phones I am disappointed that they the current chargers of the previous generation phones
Translation you can no longer use have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger
There is no listen to the radio or charge the phone
You either way to charge the phone and use the wired headset
You can not use settings to view more than one email account
Need to switch the standard overthecounter headsets because there is no outlet for it
Yet works after you open the phone edit March 212007 if you have answer on open set
picture caller id only another memory card format microanother adapter needed
I purchased my W710i from an internet company for 254
00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days
Overall Sony has is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone
I love this phone and it always produced quality products
If you dont need the bells and whistles 5 stars I would even though I havent tried all of the features of this phone
If I could rate it more than of a smartphone go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender
When it hit the clip battery cover and battery scattered in different directions on the floor
The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone
I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again
The mp3 player is simple to use accessible while the phone is closed and sounds great
You can use any headsets or earbuds easy to figure out and fine reception
Sturdy fairly you prefer and the radio makes it the device of choice for gymrats or runners alike
A great phone if bluetooth gprs IR 2Mpix camera mp3 player 512 MB included and so on
Sony Ericsson W710i is a very nice cell phone 85090018001900 GSM pedometer you dont need smartphone features
The original battery never battery I never run out of power anymore
With this replacement lasted an entire day if I talked very much
The battery is a little comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly
The new battery bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip
When I looked at my tried to charge me some liquidation fee of 30
So Cingular bill Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular
I have only had this phone this is the best phone I have ever owned
I must say that for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer
The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didnt intend but its really not that big of a deal I just need to retrain my hands
I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality
The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do so happy I bought it through Amazon
This phone is incredible and Im is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
very good places that were dead zones with my other phones
even in deal and smooth transaction I definitely recommend getting this phone
Only a few backgrounds ringtones Amazon and it worked beautifully from the first try
I also bought the data cable package through to choose from without downloading your own
I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations
I will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews
With the cable that came with my girlfriends V3i I have transfer blah blah blah but there have been only very few songs with any problem
There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone
I have transferred 60 songs so speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for the size
The KRZR has powerful little far onto a 2GB mico card I bought and it has been great
Playlists will also continue to play when the phone considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR so I didnt have some POS crap phone prior to the KRZR
I reupped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal reception which is nothing to sneeze at is closed which I found a very nice and convenient touch
As with RAZRs you have to be careful not to hit the the phone like I was able to get with my Nokia 7610 but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself
I wish Motorola provided you with a disk full of programs INCLUDED with internet button i wish you could lock keys like on Nokia but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that
Some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on RAZRs and KRZRS but for part of Verizon Wirelesss New Every Two program
I just received this phone free as an average size guy with average sized hands this has not been a problem at all
My main gripe with the phone is bright its easy to use its much less bulky than my former phone and the voice activation is easier
Otherwise the screen is nice and that unlike my former phone Motorola V265 it cannot be set to display the time in the 24hour format I do not use ampm
Works for me as I dont use decent zoom and playback ability
Advanced video captures the phone for internetemail or use lot other features
Great for travel with excellent sounding MP3 player integrated Bluetooth ready and big hard drive for tunes
Its thin easy to dial through and see through easy to get it on and off
before i it since getting this cover and it was just fine
I HAVE dropped dropped the phone and cracked the screen
Ive used this for a living and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck
I drive a truck model headset for 6 months and the sound quality is great
The earpiece is it disconnects sometimes at rest
Only problem can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort
It beeps when it ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product but thats not to say that that the product is not without some flaws
I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year disconnects and reconnects automatically usually within a minute or two
The reception clarity and turn up the volume on this unit and dont have to strain to hear
Also my hearing isnt the greatest and love the fact that you can battery life is quite good
My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit
Ive gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on but its still very annoying at times
Even with cable and the software for my Motorall V600 and its very easy to use
I just got the this slight annoyance I would definitely buy this product agai
I just corner of your phone the keyboard and the screen Its very good 100 Recomendation
Is Good protecs every did a backup of all my contacts pics and music
I really like the fit the belt clip is comfortable no sharp edges to irritate
All the holes are in the correct location and and function of this Cingular 8125 case
I ordered 2 complaint is that sometime it is hard to get into the phone and the cord is only about 3 feet long wish it was longer
Shipping was also quick 34 days My only other cases elsewhere that did not fit properly and I sent them back
Soft leather attractive look and very easy to use
Overthetop strap easily secures blackberry in place
Blackberry can 8703e and have not observed a single scuff or scratch on the device after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holster
I purchased this with my brand new blackberry easily be slid in and out of the holster
The only potential negative is the prettiest one I think There are other pinks but they are tacky
This is the plastic belt clip starts to dig into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time
It keeps was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectly
Although the i607 BlackJack my phone from getting scratched up and its really cute
The earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button to answer a call
Even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly
good product for how cheap i got it for absolutely nothing wrong with it
I travel a lot so something like this I would use to replace all my other USB cables
I forget which spend the cash for Bluetooth but need something to work This is it
Not looking to seller I purchase from but its small lightweight and shoudl ship quick
With the extra button you can answer put a call on hold or hang up without fumbling for your phone
I really dont opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly
The sound quality is really good and people my wife and it fit like a glove
I had ordered this case just for on the other end can hear me quite well
We both have Sprints Sanyo Katana phone which is a bit thicker than the Razr
I bought this for my Katana and you cannot find a better case at its price
My only problem is that due to the design I sometimes accidentally push the buttons on the side of the Katana when I take it out of the case
I love this phone cover it looks amazing I am concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached
This cover is what power cord thats just for charging the spare battery and a usb cord for chargingsyncing the 8125
The cradle has 2 cords a 110v my baby blackberry needed to be protected and safe
I just bought this headset and talk on the phone has microphone built in
The stereo headset lets you listen to music for use with an LG VX8300
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly perfectly and I couldnt be happier
It fits my Treo 650 what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
I have used this product for about thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
As others have noted it does increase the four months and had another brand prior to that
But the phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I have dropped my thickness gains you considerable protection
I like the design of this are under the skin but easy to press
The function buttons unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good protection ease of use and good handling
Only disadvantage is that formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
This was custom you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
My one complaint is they advertise to the pictures and thought about it
I should have paid more attention it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
The 700w and p if you dont know are same but they different icons and purposes
The button layout is the almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
Well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Im going to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
The software nat so recent past No problems what so ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegance
0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone
The flipphone factor lets you talk comfortably and texture that seems to prevent any scratches
The surface is a curious safely with the antena safely away form your brain
AMAZING had it for a week now and it works flawlessly
I have battery life surprising for an MP3 phone
I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phone before but I am really happy
The Camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great reception
Definetly a phone to the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Microtm M2tm NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone
This phone form Amazon actully comes with pick up if you are looking for a new one
It also feels a bit light in the pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera
But other that that this is a bottom when you hold it open in your hand
It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated
The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger
The way the phone is shaped you have to remember that when talking to someone
so you just want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception
The inside screen is really really bright I turned it all the way especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music
The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell
this is the 2nd TMobile it works pretty well as phone and modem
using it with SE phone after T637 and this phone is just better
voice the strongest part the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years the speakerphone is OK not so loud
reception another strongest part with TMobile it can get some weak signal when all other dont get signal at all however the antenna is located at the top back where the loop is touching this part will lose reception
operation typical SE style pretty easy for SE users 3 dedicated buttons web messaging task
cam excellent even though it doesnt have autofocus like K750 and K790 it looks pretty good even its better than nokia 6270
bt very easy to use and pair with pc suite installed file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake the transfer speed is 300400kB this is the maximum of bt 2
screen the main screen is pretty bright even I have to set the brightness down animated standby screen is simply cool external screen however is monochrome it maybe a plus when using outdoors the main is barely viewable under sunlight it display info only its a kinda inconveient when doing selfpic
audio player I seldom use it because it doesnt support ogg vorbis which I mainly use streaming audio supports real only no shoutcast
conclusion this phone is a pretty good phone for the price quadband is a must for Cingular users fast EDGE modem for web and tethering
no default USB keep me updated and the cables arrived well packaged
They shipped quickly mode always asks when plug in kinda annoying
Cable is is download the software from the samsung website and plug it in
All you have to do cheap works perfectly and arrived quickly
When I ordered this item I already knew it didnt come with the driversoftware cd but minutes after I ordered it DLN but thats just an issue with my phone I guess and nothing with the product
im kind of bummed that that charge feature doesnt work on my phone D807 sent me an email telling me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me the link
Reason 1 It keeps on charging your cell phone cell phone gets transferred so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car
Reason 2 Only data that can be played by your when you are transferring data trust me this helps when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone
You will have to use windows media player to sync this phone Samsung Sync SGHA707 in order to transfer files
MP3 and WMVWMA formats work with this phone i do not know whether other formats work or not
Let me explain cable to your phone first and the USB end to your computer USB port Preferably USB 2
Connect one end of the in brief how to sync this phone with windows media player
If you have already inserted media card into the you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu
Now open Windows media player phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open My Computer on your computer
From left to right you will be able to see in this order Now Playing Library Rip Burn Sync and Guide
Make sure your Cell phone is connected now you will see two halves in the same window left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it goes your cell phone name apears on the top usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file this takes a while
Also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory
Once you are well versed with what your phone can play i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB readerwriter as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer this saves you a chunk of time and battery power
This cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere
I received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an email to let me know where to download the appropriate program free from the Samsung website
I ordered this USB quickly found out it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could add music to my phone
While there is no software provided I cable for my Samsung SYNC and it came fast
After searching I found that Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for FREE If you want to fully utilize your Syncs camera and MP3 capabilities I highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to Samsungs site for the free software
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
I have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that
As others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
I like the design my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
The function buttons are under GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications the skin but easy to press
It gives good protection it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
Only disadvantage is that you can not keep ease of use and good handling
This was custom is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
My one complaint formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Well the skin has is the same but they different icons and purposes
Im going to see if the battery life with the standard battery is horrible
If you own a Q you know theres a way to remove these somehow
This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery which is great
So I can charge my phone with the standard battery and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot
Also it makes a wonderful stand for the phone and when hooked to the USB cable you get data conectivity too
Only downside it wont charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged
The plugs fit fine not have headphones with the proper impedance you will NOT get stereo sound
If you do I got the 2 pack and I get STEREO sound through both headphones
My crappy Panasonic lucky but for this low price this adapter is fine
Maybe Im just headphones and better Sony isolation headphones work fine with this adapter
If you the limitations of my files on the treo so its clearly good enough
I can hear want sterling sound you shouldnt be listening to mp3 anyway
This is the kind of thing you dont care about unless it malfunctions
It seems sturdily built and unlikely to break easily
The rightangle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device A problem with straight plugs
It doesnt seem to have been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well
I wondered if the snap like its part of the phone
Its rock solid and looks on concept would feel and look secure
Additionally the extra protection it provides to the little screen is wonderful
Id love to buy more colors whenif they become available
I am the price vs buying it from your cell phone company
Great for very surprised how well this case fit my Razr V3M
The cable works great with my SGH707 but the cd did not have the right driver
However you can download the correct driver from samsung
I recomend to buy the cable it took way too long over ten days to get here
The cable was perfect exactly what I needed but and then download the driver for your phone
Holds the phone in an attractive snug leather case Clips to belt and holds tight
Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical I dont have trouble catching it on things
Ive broken the clip catch on something and the plastic clip would snap
The phone would on several cases getting in and out of the car
This case works same case so they both fit within this rubber case
The L2 uses the great and eliminates that problem The perfect solution
However the keys are laid out differently on the L6 so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys
I didnt give it a low rating because its well built and is actually a really great product just wanted to give other L2 owners a warning
It works well but a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket
For the price you just cant beat it and its its just a little funky on an L2 but totally usable
Even though the keys are covered it is still pretty tactile
Would have liked something to protect the screen
After about a year the it with a Mobile Traveller model since the Mobile Freedom is no longer made
Good news it has a 2 year warranty and Logitech is replacing ear support on this Bluetooth headset broke
Contact Logitech Tech Support Audio by a company stand behind their products
Its nice to see phone cant be done over the web
Works great its a bit bigger than some headsets but in this case I feel thats a good thing the microphone does a lot better job can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly
The only complaint would be I wish the volume went up just a bit more it filtering out background noise and you dont get a feedback loop where the person youre talking to hears themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker
the hole to plug the charger into awhile to find it when I first got it
It took me is under the thing that holds it onto your ear it rotates out of the way
To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either
Feedback loop Where the other person hears themself speak
Ambient noise The other end hears everything around you especially in a car
In minimizing these the Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best
Ive tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without extraneous noises
As for me I hear everyone fine on all the headsets but a conversation is a twoway street and if youve ever used a headset Im sure youre tired of hearing Take me off that stupid thing
The negatives with and ugly but your friends will thank you
Yes its big this headset are far outweighed by the call clarity
The other negative to be aware of although I assume this is more due to the age of my headset as its only going to buy a new one Id get this one
Overall if I was recently started doing this is that Ive found is that after 1 year while the battery still holds a charge well it sometimes drops the link to the phone when I hang up after a call and I cant get it back until I recharge the thing
As far as the other 3 tested Ill but hard to keep in your ear
Plantronics Discovery 655 not too bad rank them in order of call quality best to worst
Jensen Stereo Looks cool but a total piece of garbage
Motorola HS850 Headphones WBB100RX more for wireless stereo headphones than for calling
If youre wondering why I have of the candybar blackberries 7100 nice but receptionmike was horrendous 7130 much better finally nailed it
Ive had several gens 4 headsets its because theres nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone
Was dubious when I had to difference like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something
Slightly smaller than 7130 which oddly does make a take a pearl when my 7130 went funky
Makes my partners Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison
The pearl trackball is just fine like it better than roller actually
Reception mike quality are also good despite be so durn accurate I sometimes forget to check
Writing is good too the suretype continuing to concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130
So I thought the 7130 was my bulletproof email PDA and phone this is yr baby
If you need perfect smartphone the one that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great
Slightly shorter to stop lugging around a phone AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts calendar and tasktodo list
My first blackberry and I love it I wanted battery life but hasnt stranded me yet
I wanted a cheapest 30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly its just great I bought the 40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it
I didnt really care about internet music or camera but the phone that synched with Outlook and was a great phone
I use the mp3 songs as very nice to have for onthespot photos that you dont want to lug around the regular digital for
Camera is ok not great but ok and ringtones and its GREAT to be able to instantly recognize whos calling from the music
I actually user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day
However Im not a heavy emailed a picture on the spot very cool
Only cons so far are 1 getting used to the keypad believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word
Ive followed other folks advice and dont really look at the words letter by letter i type a sentence and then look it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word
Still this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim
2 Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone I have to reseat the battery to get the change to take effect
3 Volume when talking even on speakerphone is average not terrible but ok
4 I also wonder how long the track ball will last Im not a heavy user and I still use it constantly
I think im going to buy the insurance plan just in case
These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more
Its true what some say Im a months or so but I dont anticipate any problems
Ill update this review again in 3 crackberry because playing with this thing is addictive
My only regret is I didnt hold out until ever used and among the best phones Ive ever used
Top line This is the best BlackBerry Ive a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosk
I can use using Blackberry since the first pagerstyle 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthrough for me
Ive been some what grudgingly it at work and after hours with out compromise in functionality and stylesize
Finally I have a corporate device that treats me like a consumer
Great voice dial particularly if you are a commuter with a headset
No need to record your voice for each address dont look like a dork talking to something the size of my palm
Size and appearance Finally I entry just say who you want to call and it it doesnt understand you it will prompt you for more info
The phone is as as with all modern BlackBerries
Easy private email setup small as many phoneonly candy bars
Seems to have some sort of auto setup 40 USD to synchronize my address book calendar tasks and notes from my MacBook Pro
Macintosh compatibility I just bought The Missing Sync for Apple Mac OS X for Mac mail and Gmail others too I imagine
Works great The innovative Outlook Today style summery screen for missed calls latest emails etc
Fantastic screen and software provided by RIM is not very easy to use
Look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with the phone
As others have mentioned the keyboard is very good
Coming from a full size BB keyboard I thought I might miss it but the 8100s is a breeze to use
Speaker phone is functional and sound quality in general is fine
I think I have a minor voice would be appreciated like native iSync and bluetooth support
More Mac compatibility quality issue between the phone and my Motorola H700 headset the best headset Ive ever owned
In fact this is the first cell phone Ive had where I had a data plan setup
I gotta say Im luving it My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop
The browser is very robust and seems to work great
Ive installed a few extra applications google maps bbweather and Yahoo go to name a few and I havent had any problems
The applications cover yet to try the Opera browser for the BB
I still have a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful
The camera is so clear with and without the flash its scary
Ive discovered that the moniker CrackBerry is so true
Im just hooked on getting emails surfing the web and listening to some tunes all from the same device at the same time
Ive discovered a whole community of simmilar BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of this device
The pearls suretype keyboard learns as even need to censor the typing too often anymore
I dont I go and words it didnt get right at first it now picks up and selects as I type
I stuck with Ive never used any other type of mobile device keyboard prior to the pearl
This may be because the suretype mode and caught on to it right quick
My only complaints are that the mp3 only through the speaker on the device or through the wired headset
You can trick it into doing so but normal play is player will not play through a wireless headset
Also the speakerphone is a bit muffled as the vibration of the phone is kind of weak
Finally the battery cover actually covers up the speaker Now there are after mod kits that have an oem battery cover with a hole for the speakerphone but come on
Overall this device is great for beginners like myself
I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device
Its stylish beautiful Amazon Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number
However since i bought it from small and it has some awsome features
So I constantly had to call placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didnt want to work
Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I amazon and ask them about my order
So the representatives HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL
Luckily I called Cingular and a very told me there was something wrong with my SIM card
Overall Amazon should be shopping Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too
But whatever I love more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasnt easy
Ive had this phone for about a week now and Im glad there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions
Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windowsbased devices I waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive
Also I was NOT to get a PHONE first with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the device
My motivation for purchasing was primarily convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type
Loading ringtones a pain is MUCH better than first impressions would lead you to believe
The music player at first proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research
After a few hours of frustration I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app
Again did some research visited a few forums and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize
As an owner of into the menu functions youll find much more functionality
But once you go a NANO I was disappointed with the interface of the player
Its not an ipod but ipod owner youll likely have no complaints
And if youre not an it works as an decent replacement
Sound of soso but I dont really care about that anyway
Camera is only tunes is quite nice when using headphones
Must admit that of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy
The couple I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera
As far as email I have a BB from work and they wont let me use a nonwork issued device to access the network so I have no opinion on email functionality
Organizer features calendar tasks notes etc seem more than adequate
The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I havent one of my ringtones as the default ringer
One I would like to set been able to figure out and while Im admittingly not a techie these should be pretty basic and intuitive
That should be fairly simplistic order of the icons on some of the themes
Two I would like to change the but I cant figure it out
Almost forgot but this is really my only MAJOR complaint
Not sure why cant listen to music through bluetooth
And BTW form purchasing the Blackjack very happy that I went with the Pearl
I came so close to factor and looks are simply the best out there
UPDATE Figured Windows mobile environment I was expecting something along the lines of Startprogramsetcetc
Coming from a out how to set default ringtone and move icons
I was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience
Im going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo
Otherwise as close to a must say its an awesome device My husband has a BlackBerry through his work so I got one too
This is my first BlackBerry phone and I perfect device as Ive used and Ive used quite a few
How we can PIN each other keep in touch via email etc
The Pearl has wonderful reception great style great features etc
It had a my big concerns was the phone size
Unfortunately one of few issues but generaly speaking it worked well
When I first Bought I was carring a brick in my packet If you are an smart phone user then you know what I am talking about
But after having it for a while it felt like it I did not think it woud be a big deal
I wanted to switch phones between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearl
I was debating but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size
At first I thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palm Q or bjack but I had it for does but also has the same or more capabilities and browsing speed
The pearl not only does not have the flaws that palm 3 months now and to tell the truththere is so many advantages on this phone I do not miss my palm at all
The trackball works way better than a touchscreen
So far I am very happy with my purchase that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack
The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring a phone and not a brick in my packet
Not sure about it then do not believe me simply check the reviews of all smarth phones online
You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other smart phones
This product was perfect all I needed to move pictures from my phone to my pc
neat cable good connectors but havent established what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly communications between PC and cellphone with cable yet
It fits my Treo 650 four months and had another brand prior to that
I have used this product for about perfectly and I couldnt be happier
As others have noted the thickness gains you considerable protection
But it does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
I have dropped my phone on leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
I like the design of this unit as it concrete several times and nary a scratch
The function buttons are under the skin but easy to press
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
It gives good can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
Only disadvantage is that you protection ease of use and good handling
This was custom is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
My one complaint formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it
The 700w and p if you dont know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
The button layout images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Well the skin has is the same but they different icons and purposes
Im going for six months and it is the best one I have ever had
I have had it to see if theres a way to remove these somehow
I like it so much that I dont wanna get rid of it
This phone is great I got it for Christmas and it works like a charm The loud speaker is excellent and the ringtones are cool
Some of the are loud and you can easily hear it ringing
The ringtones wallpapers are a bit weird but they have nice ones too
the LCD screen a comfortable size and I love this phone
The buttons are is big and the menus are easy to navigate
So far I havent found any flaws at all and the phone has great battery life
I had to keep it on for a few hours and the bars stayed the same I highly reccomend this phone to any who like it
The phone is light weight and small and a camera Id say that it is still great As for the cons
Even though it doesnt have it doesnt get in the way I love this phone and have encouraged someone to get one already
I cannot think of any and but not designed for those people who are on their phones all day
Virgin Mobile is great anyone who says that you cannot hear it ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong company
I bought this little Im driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now
I got it to keep with me when phone 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it
It has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars
What I like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can be easily tucked inside pockets or small bags
It charges fully in a very short time for a very long time as I just found out recently
It holds that charge under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that
Driving to an appointment I for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail
Id forgotten to recharge the phone was running late and needed to call to let them know
To my delight it turned right on like me and ends up costing about 6 a month
The Virgin prepay plan is perfect for users and I made the call with no problems
Tell me theres something find the best possibility and this was it
I looked long and hard to better and Ill say prove it
For a nice dependable insurance wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the low ringtone problem by searching for audiovox 8610 hack over the internet
This phone is great It has all the basic features I type phone I couldnt be more pleased and genuinely recommend it
You can purchase a make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free
Then you can cable on ebay and dl some free softwares over the net
Of course you have unless you know what youre doing
So dont do it to be computersavey to do so
The phone allows ringtone can be attached to a phone number in the phonebook so you know whos calling by the ring
The cool thing is that each 20 seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone
I downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav ring whistle homer doh wolf howl all in one 20 second ringtone
example 3 stooges sound bell files from the net and mix n match them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones
I also made some songs and soundeffects are louder than others
I noticed some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well
Thus I only keep the loudest ringtone and theyre is always on sale at places like Target
Overall this phone very loud I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the ring in my pocket and backpack
If you can make your own admit if you want more from prepaid Virgin Mobile is a rip off
I have to ringtone and download it into the phone you can have all the free custom ringtones you could ever dream of
But if youre Audiovox about a year or two ago and it was a good investment
I bought my only going to use your phone once in a while then its alright
Sleek phone outer color display is great and the battery life is amazing
Furthermore the dsiplay the calls were good quality and I never would get dropped calls
The phone has all the also say that despite the service Vmobile has good phones
I have basic features looks great and is practical for anyone whos not looking for anything outrageous like cameras or Mp3
But now that Im needing my phone new promotions those hardly last and are only for new customers
And for their more and more Im ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the whole 25 cents a minute and 10 cents after that is too expensive
The ringtones are a little features minutes whatever I say look into other prepaid offers like net10 tracphone or Tmobile
If you want to get more pricey but still reasonable test messaging is available at 10 cents good price
You get more prepaid with tmobile but the ive owned this phone for about 2 months
im also 14 yrs old and phones with good stuff will cost you a bit more
but i couldnt switch my carrier and it was waayyy expensive
so i looked for a fone that is great for texting and i wouldnt have to pay alot for texting
the only thing a bit bulky and it doesnt have as much features as the enV
also it is is it doesnt have an mp3 player nor a camcorder
this fone has instant messaging and multimedia messaging
virgin mobiles service is good but i have to be honest i do not use this fone to talk but only to text
u dont have to be a teenager to have this fone but this fone is ideal for a textcrazed teenager
i jus found out that kyocera has a new upcoming fone
I bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago so I got a good deal on it
Well as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard
Other than that I have had no problems call reception is great
The camera on this phone isnt the greatest but I dont need it to be high end for the basic fun pics I take
If youre looking to get zoom in larger clearer pictures this isnt the phone for you
The camera screens can be a bit confusing but Ive learned to deal with it my pics come out as I like
A strange feature is the speakerphone while it txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small
The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for is quite loud clear Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound
As far as plans are concerned I dont have any the monthly plans arent recommended though
Its good to know that problems w over charges since I have the 18 centsmin plan
A bonus to the per minute plans is the Sugar Mama service where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips
Good for purchasing games or ringtones wo using up your topup money
And this cell isnt carry QWERTY phones those that do require addtl internet service plans like Blackberrys Black Jack Palm TREOs
I got this phone bc other carriers hardly only for the young crowd Im an over 25 mom
I only wanted I have been a realtor a nursean HR person a mom
I can say to easily send txts have it in one compact phone
I remember my first digital of 5 phones motorola nokia ericson panasonic
I have had a total phone and first pnone with games
I dont want a a text phone that is small and easy to use
What I want is treo palm because I already travel with a lap top
The menu is on the phone the more you want a qwerty key board
The more features you need just like a computer and easy to make selections
Also the saleslady threw it on the and the antena is the loop so it wont poke you
Very sturdy little phone ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it
Comes with a very easy to my region and it is worth every penny
I paid 199 for this phone in read guide book so start up is easy
I have a Motorola V220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month
The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet
Its fairly light weight and made of plastic but seems durable enough
A small red LED lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet regardless of whether youre charging your phone or not
I debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price
I purchase this phone for both my wife and I and we both love them
Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time to pairing with a bluetooth headset was quick and painless
Reception and call quality are great and learn to navigate but is very versatile and functional
There is no 3g in my with both a standard and extended battery
This phone comes area but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing
With pretty heavy party software available to make this phone do pretty much whatever you want
Lots and lots of 3rd usage I still have 12 battery power at night
Ive been using my Blackjack for Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes
Sure there are things I would change but the about 3 months now and I love it
The keyboard buttons are really small but then Im not sure how like this 1800BigDeal good luck on figuring out the alphatonumeric translation
If you ever see an ad that has a number you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger
I upgraded to be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone
The list would the BJ from a Razr and really miss this feature
Browser support is awesome I can view everything even Flash apps
Glass screen doesnt scratch and screen resolution is unbelievable
Quick toggle to slide the battery off to remove or replace
No having scroll button on side is a life saver
I hear the iPhone is supposed to be the real deal but until I see for myself Im sticking with this beauty
Free Cant go wrong which ever way you look at it
It is the best windows status instead the screen has to be on all the time
There is no LCD light to tell you its charging mobile phone currently available in my oppinion
There is no way to know when the num lock key is on so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up
In order to unlock the phone you have to press the onoff button at the top of the phone which is not in a very convenient location
this has a the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery
Great feature is nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality
Having one battery to recharge and using the other until plugging in to recharge is totally awesome
Not having to worry about the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer
When cellphone first came out if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player
Get the extra long life battery this was a standard feature then it was optional then it was gone
Video conversion MS Windows media player audio format will play
Any MP3 or is a bit spotty and frustrating
Convert is or Me video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP
Sorry Win2k users forget NT or Win9X easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11
Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there
Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory
Since this is a MS Smartphone there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone
Be aware of the aspect ratio this is a landscape display and not portrait
If you get games or applications you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness
Size your pictures to the display and for it be sure of the aspect ratio
The thumbwheel is great of the camera phones I have seen are very good either
Camera is slow and not very clear but none for navigation and web browsing
The ones that come with this phone are lame at best
The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to get around
Hate the Cingular activation policy and dont think itd protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up
Product is ok cost for the internet access service but that is not the phones fault so maybe I should not list this complaint
But it is aesthetically appealing for how well it works
It is unbelievably inexpensive will protect from small scuffs and scrathes
I was concerned with the 1 star review so I ordered from desirepro who had a higher rating instead of Eforcity
It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pocket
This case is about 12 inch wider and thicker puts it to sleep which is nice
It looks great and the magnet but it protects the phone on all sides except the top
Even though it is a bit more bulky I cant many use Best Skins Ever with it no problem
I just use a screen protector but go back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks
You can pretty much do anything you that you can manager anything you would like
Other then would like with this product The only draw back that i could find is that it doesnt charge while you have it plugged in
after talking to cingular i found out that i would have to spend 40 to get a cable to connect my samsung d807 to my laptop
and i can manage anything on my phone that i wan
Had heard other replacement and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus
These replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone styluses didnt quit fit properly
Works just towns to buy such a simple thing but they didnt have them
I looked everywhere in two fine Delivery was earlier than predicted
I ordered it one way to buy such items Thanks for a great job
This is the evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right to my doorno muss no fuss
The silicone protective covering for the Treo 650 perfectly and I couldnt be happier
It fits my Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be
I have used this product does increase the thickness somewhat but certainly no less than leather cases etc
As others have noted it for about four months and had another brand prior to that
But the thickness gains you considerable protection
I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch
I like the design of this are under the skin but easy to press
The function buttons unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications ease of use and good handling
It gives good protection GPS car holder but does do what is was designed to do
Only disadvantage is that formed for every curve bump and button on the Treo
This was custom you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock
My one complaint is they advertise to the pictures and thought about it
I should have paid more attention it as compatible with the 700w and 700p
The 700w and p if you dont know are same but they different icons and purposes
The button layout is the almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen
Well the skin has images on the theres a way to remove these somehow
Im going to see if button covers for the 700w not the 700p
Compared to the face out belt put the phone in with the camera facing the clip
Make sure you clip I had previously this face in version has proved to be a bit more stable and sturdy so far
This is a great holster really cheap price I ordered a couple this time because its only fault is that it will it can be and thicker in all the necessary places
It is heavy duty rubber that is thin where break pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hit it on the arm of a chair but for the money its great
It has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the Sansa screen from scratching or shattering
Youd be silly not to purchase this 20 case to protect your 150 investment
The one downside I can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allow the player to sit in most cradles docks or speakers
It is not difficult to put the case on but it would be frustrating to take it on and off often
Just something to consider if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often
The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the toughskin on
I gave this four a slim sleek product is now a rather large rubberized item
What was once stars because the jacket adds significant bulk and weight to the Sansa product
On the plus side this jacket definitely protects the MP3 that is very hard and will not be easily scratched
They included a belt clip and a screen cover it is very solid and covers the item completely and securely
The buttons were other color choices but over all Im very pleased with the product
I wish there around the wheel are far easier to press now
Before it was covered I was reluctant to put all of the things it will do considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the Ipod Nano
The Sansa e200 is good for in my purse or pocket for fear of breakage and scratches to the screen but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go
Unlike the Nano it will play video in FM tuner and FM recorder which can be nice
Further unlike the Nano the Sansa has a built and comes with its own video conversion software
Finally the sansa has a voice recorder which I MicroSD memory card but turns on slowly when a memory card is placed in the expansion slot
The Sansa which will accept upto a 2gig do not have a personal use for but just goes to show how feature rich this mp3 player is
I like to listen makes listening to audio books very difficult
This to audio books and the Sansa does not have the ability to bookmark
Overall the Sansa is a very feature rich player with a great battery life with only a few shortcomings
Im always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well
I dont have to worry about the screen getting scratched The screen on the Sansa e2oo series scratches very easily with the hard plastic screen protector
I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and coworkers
While I thankfully havent had I would change is to give it a fixed belt clip
The only thing to test the protective qualities of this product it appears it will do the job nicely
Great case protects my are hard to find thank you Speck
Decent Sansa products Sansa well even makes the buttons easier to push
great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user
Always at Starbucks or Libraries studying and this added safety is necessary to protecting the player
It is very well made and seems that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it
The funny thing is that now like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall
Before I bought in the case it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure
Now that it is the ToughSkin the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped
It is true that screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well
The hard plastic the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it
The only problem being that excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend
Overall this is an the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect
This cover is the best you little but the durability is worth it
It increases the size a can get for your Sansa E series player
The belt clip is item my display began to show minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use so if you dont buy this at least get the little expensive stick on covers
It also comes with a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary great cause I use mine at the gym too
The toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier
The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the microsd slot without removing the Sansa but that is only a small issue
My advice you have spent big owner of Body Glove Cel Phone cases a Moto V810
Im a previous bucks for a great little mp3 player so spend a little more and protect it the best you can
I purchased this item from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255
The case protects every part of my Cel buttons screens jacks and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case and looks nice
I got this caseholster a case is durable and I am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months
What I would add is that the while back after another makers fell apart in a short time
The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snap together so they stay in up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case
The part that slips over the top of the phone has a builtin seethrough window that lines place on the phone so it cant easily fall out a problem that Id had with a different product
The quality a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone
I was of construction looks to be pretty good too
I wanted a holster this one arrived and I tried it on my Motorola V180
I was absolutely pleased when that wasnt a sloppy generic model that didnt fit
So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you that you wont be disappointed
The added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer
This is a great case I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didnt line up
Because this is a flip phone most cases move when you open and shut the phone covering speakers etc
This case is 2 pieces that connect together of materials and fit of this case are excellent
Also the quality so the movement when you open and close the phone doesnt affect the placement of the holes etc
After reading the reviews here of this case were fairly cheesey although they were cheaper
The cases Id seen in stores I thought Id take the plunge and try it
The materials and he was right on Awesome custom fit Great case for the money THANK YOU Gar
From longviewers advice I got this case are firstrate and the fit is perfect
This is for all the folks who got the free or comments on the home screen going kaplooky nuf said I needed a better grade clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad
The V180 apparently has had a few nearly free Motorola V180 Spend the money on this case to protect your phone I looked at many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly really PROTECTIVE
Sydney Harbour gets high marks a sweet fit nice and snug formfitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching
Secondly the supersoft matte black leather is on this feature not flimsy dull plastic but very clear quality stuff
The cut outs are perfectly lined up too there IS one for the speaker phone feature on the back not mentioned in the ads
Snap on the antenna loop and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel
Sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product but if youre like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases
Be nice to yourself and your phone Go with Sydney Harbour and avoid the cheaper stuff
The cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient
It does not come with a case so youll use your own bag or whatever
The only thing I can see that could be a problem the head phone wires chargers and you name it junk in our console between the van seats
Retractables just take up less space among all is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged
Functions the same as more not have software or drivers for the enV VX9900
The included software for the USB cable does expensive chargers sold in Cellphone stores
Price is right the texture of the skin feels like rubber
I like for the car charger though so I am not mad
Charges phone have it on the desk and I can use the speaker phone on my desk
It is nice to and second battery at the same time
Velcro is velcro its solid but the the side connectors allowing quick access to the phone
Love the flexability of separation noise can be annoying when youre trying to get to your phone in a quiet setting
Shipper delivered this product in a timely manner and the product is of great quality
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look
Though it makes the phone a little more bulky than you might be used to at first it quickly becomes a nonfactor and though it doesnt provide quite as much extra life as I had hoped it would it does in fact make the difference between my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry
This car charger for the Blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores at a fraction of the price
I also use it available when the Pearl hit the market we were able to get them from this merchant
These cases were not to charge my Motorola Bluetooth headset that has the same USB mini jack
I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake
Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potential to last a long time something that prior holsters have failed to do
I also like the magnetic closure which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case without the need for finding a snap fitting
My older Blackberries have had cases which after use had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the twohanded method for nesting my phone one hand to move the flap out of the way and the other to insert the phone into the case
This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the morepreferred onehanded approach
Although still relatively new my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction
Before I purchased my Leather Swivel case I looked at 3rd party generic cases
Each of these were unable to notify my Blackberry that it was in its holster
With my new swivel case as soon as I insert my Pearl the display shuts off thereby extending battery life
In addition this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or not
Also since this the USB connectorthe earphone outlets and the volume control buttons are all accessible
When holsetered both is an OEM case it was made especially for my Pearl
With nonOEM cases in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone I might have to remove the phone from its case
I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no case at all
This is probably due to its small still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratchpotential
Of course that size and your ability to just slip the phone into your shirt pocket unlike prior Blackberry devices
They should have at least provided a simple pouch which would provide some protection
This of course is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel case which is the subject of THIS review
Allinall I highly recommend this case for those on your own if you want it to work well with the e815
You need to hunt down all the drivers and software for it of you who still wear your phones on your belt
but that was long enough for me charger also connecteddisconnected constantly
The to do a seem edit and so now Ill use bluetoothobex to sync and transfer
making my phone beep every 10 seconds as it started to chargenot charge repeatedly
If you plan to use it for this purpose I recommend hunting down Moto phone tools 3
11 SDmodified p2k seem and the e815 usb drivers usbmot2000
Besides all the functions described above the cable has one more functionit can be used as a charger tooThis is really cool
For every order I much better life than the battery that come with the Q
This battery has put I received the products within 34 days at the price of ground shipping fees
I would say you the Q but they cost 4959 so for 13 or so this is a pretty good deal
There are higher Mah batteries available for can do twice as much talking surfing texting etc
The only downside and maybe I just didnt battery for the juicesucking Q it is worlds better than the included battery
Though still not quite enough read description well enough is that the battery door is silver which looks dorky on my black Q
I would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies
The battery Was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly
The Battery Q like I do I watch movies play NES games listen to music oh yeah make call send text messages etc
Great buy if you use your Makes the Phone Last 2 days even with continued use
If you are like this case It is easy to put on and take off
I really like me and drop your phone constantly then this is a great product for you
It does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen
It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold
I would really like for something to glow in the dark so that I could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse
Hey what kind of phone is that Im getting the red one too and the pink one for my sweetie
I have tried makes it and it dropped 80 of incoming calls on pickup and 20 of outgoing calls
The latest was the Cingular 8525 HTC 45 of theses phones over the last 4 years
I thinks Windows was loading a DLL lt The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based SPs
I wasnt 100 sure Id want the 680 when it was first announced but a big nasty scratch on my 650s screen helped me decide to take the plunge
The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better the internal slot for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might get lost and the covered SD card slot is very welcome because the darned thing always popped out in my 650
The only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button
To reset since even on the 650 you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch
Thats not a big deal the 680 you have to take out the battery
Whats better on the 650 The main thing for for everything since its also a great Palm organizer
I use this phone me is that the cell phones radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards SDHC
In addition to that Ive installed a registered version PlaysForSure if youre into that
Its even compatible with of Pocket Tunes so its a very good MP3 player
I also use the phone have absolutely zero complaints about this phone
I to play games like Monopoly and Scrabble when Im waiting on line or in a boring meeting
Believe it or not i consider going depends on the usage and the person
i guess the whole battery problem from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrade
My battery problem is that i cant kill the darn thing
I am one of those people that depletes a battery completely before recharging it
I do it to my laptop absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks
Devoted Palm users will and my iPod and the PDA i had before the BlackJack the Tungsten 2E
Mainly because you CAN NOT create and edit backup Needless to say the Treo 680 saved me
Even the contacts wouldnt word excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook
If you do go the i think the coolest part is how you can set up a Favorite 5 like TMobile offers but still have all the reliability of Cingular
However if you go with the lovely Treo check out DialByPhoto way of the blackjack without Outlook look into SBSHs programs Facade and Papyrus
I just go What can that thing do and i respond to that what cant it do
Some people ask me the phone about 3 days ago and i love it
I can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do
The last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance
The Pros PDA good mobile phone get a replacement longer life battery Seidio makes one and the browser Blazer has MANY problems
The Cons Youll need to that really gets out a camera for all those Kodak Moments all packed in one for a good price
Im very for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one
Ive wanted a TREO happy with the purchase of this smartphone
You can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software its a nice little phone
I havent bought a memory card for it so I cant report on the mp3 capabilities but I am going in that direction
Somehow I dont use it for many applications I especially love having the Goodlink email application my family videos mp3s pics and all my office documents at a touch of a finger
Ive had my Treo for a month and heavily think it will replace my iPod but you never know
Yes the battery life is a real eye catcher and feel great in the hand
The slick and slim design goes quickly but I dont mind charging my treo every night
in the one month of though I saw a lot of negative reviews some about battery life some about dropped signals
I bought this even usage my Treo has hung one time a simple reset fixed it and hasnt hung since
I have owned many Palm devices over the years and the most customeroriented qualityoriented company out there
Not I will be the first one to say that Palm can make lemons and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later if they ever do
But their OS is still the easiest to use in my mind and with the myriad of apps out there you can make it do whatever you want pretty much
The screen is on the smallish side compared to the TX but its not that bad especially for a phone
Its pretty reliable most I was expecting something really bad but so far I have never been under 50 and I am a heavy Palm user
The battery is what surprised me the and I have put a lot of my old software on it
I dont use the phone part of off the keyboard lights unless you are using it which probably helps a lot
I also bought KBLightsOff which turns it much just a call here and there and I turn the phone function off at night
So with these two settings battery life is close to the TX in my opinion
I have one dead pixel but that can happen to any electronics manufacturer
5mm jack at the bottom of the use my good headphones and sound is good
But with an adapter I can device thats a terrible place to put it
Get pTunes Deluxe so you can use subsription music like Napster or Yahoo Music
I should receive my 8GB SDHC card tomorrow which will turn my Treo into an iPhone killer IMHO
Sound level is OK and you can get software that boosts it up if youre deaf
Speaker level is LOUD The SMS program is great the phone app is great and fast
I wish Palm wouldnt charge an arm and a without taking away from its beauty nor does it make the phone bulkier
Overall I am very happy with this product it protects the phone leg for accessories but you dont have to buy from them
My only compliants are that it does would work better with a money type clip
I think this not come with a screen cover and it makes the phone slightly harder to slide open
However since Verizon doesnt carry tip top condition this skin is incredibely sexy and allows me to use my phone with ease
My chocolate phone is obviously valuable to me so I want to keep it in anything like this in clear this works
Promptly received two replacement batteries for our phones for the price of one from the original vendor
They work great They hold a charge with normal use for about twothree days as did our original ones when we first purchased them
Bought this to replace my threeyearold cell phone and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc
Ive had a couple of questions that I asked Cingular only to be forwarded to Palm only to be forwarded to Microsoft then back to Cingular
It seems no Customer Service way Ive found to fix it is to do a soft reset
The unit turns off the sound by itself and the only department has really mastered this unit
Im not crazy about Microsoft Outlooks calendar compared to Palms
I miss several Palm features like the Go to and the Today buttons
Outlooks calendar just isnt as easy to manuever as Palms
Phone listening volume is low especially when the unit is in a protective case which puts it a little further from your ear
Love being kids I have each kids picture linked to their phone number
We have five able to press a picture to make a call
Even my technologychallenged husband can who is calling and when your next appointment is
This phone talks A female voice announces call them by simply pressing their picture
The first time she spoke computer on Star Trekbut not as clear
The voice reminds me of the it about scared me to death
However after getting used to her accent she is intelligible I could live without this and the extra monthly cost
I dont need email on the run and which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken wordsamazing
Most traditional Internet web sites take much too long to load and display too small a portion of the page to be useful
It is nice to check the weather or get directions on the go
Cant imagine watching a sweet little Vaja leather case that is wonderful
Splurged on a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen
Amazons prices were the longer have to carry a PDA and a cell phone They are one and the same
Best part I no best BY FAR on this product Saved over 300 off my local retail Cingular dealer
Conclusion this phone is very smart and fun to use although it comes with a big learning curve
The low volume issue could be a problem for someone with bad hearing
The whole process took only a snap to figure out setting up my email took only a few minutes
The Treo 750 was 5 minites on the phone with Cingular Wireless Customer Service to port over my number from Verizon
Ive owned it for mini SD card samsung memory from ebay for 39
I bought a 4gb three weeks now and I am still discovering great phonePDA features
Combined it can hold best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2
Theyre about the 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs
Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750 but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it wont arrive for about a month and a half I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately
Because of Windows OS it is very easy to use and understand functions
I ordered this phone on Sunday evening and got it sent me the replacement of that phone through FREE 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone
Also I ordered two phones Family plan there was some problem in other phone I requested the replacement and Amazon FIRST on Wednesday Amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones
I work for this phone because my PDA was already old and I needed something that would be efficient
I decided to get an University and my contract was due 2 months ago
I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good things to say about it
First it is not as heavy as the last model 650 and also looks really cool
Second the interface palm device before so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue
The phone is Microsoft OS based I used a is pretty easy to use and figure it out
The battery works really well and in spite of other reviews the life have been pretty great even when compared with my last phone a motorola
In general I thinks is a pretty good buy and you cannot beat the price when Cingular sells it for way more money than Amazon
Ill definetively will none of the problems already reported like short time lived batery
I got really impressed with its features and had buy from this website again
The only problem I am not accept any number I will to attach to it
The icon shown in the today page does facing is with setting my voice mail
As a result I was forced to create with a downloadable file because except for this problem Treo 750 is really great
I really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by Palm a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number
Fits my Treo 680 satisfied costumer for the motorola i760 phone
hiim a even in the case which is a big plus
Before all i had was a phone phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones ive ever heard
my husband uses this boothbut now that i got this phone no booth for me and evryone is sayen they want one too so im helpen
i dont know what useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time including him
the walkie talkie feature is very its called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it
its great for a business that has many locations
i only give this product four stars because i havent tried it myself so i dont know all the features
I came over from Cingular after large display and the color of the phone overall Love Blue I bought this for 110
I choose this phone because of the trying there PTT just not happening for me and I will leave it at that
00 at a corporate store I get back and swapped it for a brand new in the box phone
We had a problem with the second one took it a discount for the company I work for
The clarity and ease of functionality is Fantastic you dont have to be a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the and I get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge which too me is great
I put the extended battery on mine GPS along with Telenav is fantastic we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower I can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkies hey if your going to spend the money do it right the first time
Dont change the default times for backlighting thats whats eating the battery time up phonebook manager package on there site which is FREE and is SO easy to use
Buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds Moto has a also dont leave a java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also
For Ringtones and wallpapers u can use WebJal once again EASY to use
I looked at other phones and I DONT NEED CAMERAS in a phone the primary selling feature was the fact of large numbers and ease of use
My husband to got to the i560 but got a great deal on these
We were going and I just recently upgraded to this phone
the other always came unclipped when a little harder to get tothat plastic still gets in the way Those are the only negatives so far
The front screen for caller ID seems a little dark and the area to charge it is I stood up falling to the ground
Since my husband is have no service you can use these as walkie talkies
Also if you switching from an old i90 he loves it Hope this helps with purchasing
I was having problems with came off and i tried to glue it back on myself
the first 730s speaker grill my second i730 transmitting and receiving so I decided to upgrade my phones
So I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet
I didnt need a camera phone since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures
One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April I couldnt sign back up for two years and get the 150
I could only sign up for a year and I had to pay 275
super short battery number key it has three big keys with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys
instead of having a separate button for each life especially if you have the web
unfortunately you have to be careful and out on this one but ill list it under cons
the jury is still hit the button fairly close to center otherwise youll dial the number above or beneath it
the casing looks like it shows the photo when you call that person
it also might break easy since it is mainly plastic whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal
if you dont use the phone for a couple of minutes the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up
The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front especially since there were several colors
This phone just blinks Treo its well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable
I really like the JAVOSkin for my a lot to your ring tone in a light blue
The material lanyard they send with the product its about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces
I dont like the is soft to the touch but strong on protection
I prefer a smaller THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk
I tripped and basically more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist
This is the second skin Ive owned the first from JAVOSkin and I like this one better than the first
The skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use
I didnt like the cord attaching bump on the side at first but I did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag
I highly recommend this product whether or not you use the cord
I love the fact that I can now drop without it its a great product for a great price
but who cares ending up in 3 pieces on the floor The only thing I dont like is that its not exactly grey but not quite clear
Idropped my new phone at for the 6133 as it doesnt easily clip into the phone you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it
This item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere in 3 places
This holster provides good secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device
The flap is protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt
This is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt
My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks
I would give it 5 bought and returned three of these units now
I have starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls
Each one has gives Bad Disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc
The DVD player constantly been defective and finally I just gave up on returning the system
The sound quality is very of these doing DVD backups and the last 5 or so failed
I used a 25 pack nice for the price but since the player doesnt work its essentially useless
I thought disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed too
Guess what My first it was my software so I got new software
Its not my burner as another consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best
So the reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read as its brand new and doesnt require the firmware upgrade they mention
Im buying some now a few before I got the ones I ordered online
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed and save myself the frustration
Well I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
I have burned many discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Very disgruntled with whatever the case I wont buy them ever again
Maybe my burners dont like them but these discs making coasters
The DVDs I that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one
The only problem is burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality
Im using the Plextor DVD burner that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters
Its less the cost love it but Im going to try my luck with a different DVD brand
Please dont expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised To date Ive been denied twice
The second time they said the U P C number was invalid
Only its the original U P C barcode I was meticulous AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint
Meanwhile I have phoned filing the paperwork yet they state All required products were not submitted
That said its definitely not worth the full asking price
Well the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it
I need disc binders but not at the expense of quality and TCO total cost of ownership
Low cost alternatives are needed and the Case Logic brand while being the original is pricey
But the flap about poor customer someone from Xtremes management is paying attention
So if service rebates and poor quality zippers and sleeve binding is enough to give me pause
Price isnt everything for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq
I use it to everyone in the markt for your product
It takes month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
Bought this a forever to copy anything to and from it
After that everytime so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon
Im always I on the camera it wanted me to reformat the cardWTH is that
One mistake I madeI threw away the shipping and product packages once over confident with LEXARs products
Needless to sayIm too I tested out the card thought It worked and It would be OK
As the other reviewer found out these type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS
did not fly either my machine is a media cards cant be formatted to work with SD Audio
I exchanged the item I was the only person having trouble with this product
Tech support told me and it was supposedly checked out before I got it
They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones
My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money
ADS also told me it would not work with Uleads Movie Factory 3 some of the software it came bundled with but that was Uleads problem
I should use Cap Wiz Their program DUH Guess what it did not work with their program either
Ulead said they had several complaints with ADSs product
Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work
Save yourself product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade
Since ADS doesnt consider the time money and aggravation buy another product P
I dont think they want a product like that either
When I purchased these batteries I was very pleased but that wore off after a couple of months
I dont use my camera all that often but when I do I expect ther batteries to have some charge
I recharge them per instructions and they do not hold a charge any longer
I know Monster makes good products but I am a little disappointed in this one
You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9
Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks
If you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page
We bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to the use in having an alarm clock if you cant trust that it will indeed wake you up
If its okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however whats their representative at the customer service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 monthsnow nap function and radio are all that worksif only I could find the damn receipt
In the ten minutes since Ive had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off
More importantly book holder My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter
The reason I purchased this particular It cant handle large manuals as advertised
Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone keep an eye on the page retainers these are the parts that fell off and you should be ok
If you dont anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages
As for me Im off to read Amazons return policy and yourself a favor dont get this product dont buy this brand and dont buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
This is the worst thing I have ever owned It broke said there were no cds inside after about a week Do see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick
But I could trying not to break the card no success
I tried hard not insert My GIG card into this reader
May be Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem
I contacted because my card was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
Any way I makes it useless for gaming especially in BF2 which use OpenAL by Creative
Cons famous poppingcrackling noises had to send it back and buy 12in1 SanDisk Reader
This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20 of high end good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change
Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have a systems not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards see Google for XFi poppingcrackling
For long and a new driver since November 2005 was promised at the end of May 2006 but beta version published 053006 did not solve my problem
Eventually it was recognized see official CL forums time Creative denied existence of this problem
In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial hacked drivers
I suspect that XFi crackling is an architecture design flow which cannot be completely solved at software level because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the the fastest sound processor simultaneously with high end graphic card HD controller and other devices
Bottom end I have to stop playing games or go back to low quality integrated sound
Do not take risk wait for working drivers or buy a working card from different manufacturer
With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars
I found that many desktop motherboards MB have really slow south bridge south bridge is connecting PCI USB Firewire and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge especially MBs with NVidia chipsets and even with some Intel MBs
New beta XFi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4GSATA2 nVidia 6100 410 MCP chipset but situation is still marginal and XFi might go unstable again
I contact CL customer service they did not solved the problem but pointed out that ATI chipsets Athlon 64 ATI 200 or 3200 have no problems with XFi
I decided not to return SB to seller but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB
I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCIX even NVidia based also should be fine with XFi
The trouble is that majority of XFi more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release if it will work
So I can give XFi two stars instead of 1 but I cannot change the rating and even buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me
About three years ago maybe four I bought two Lexar CFII cards
One never worked the other worked but lost all data
I wrote to Lexar that I told her to only use it on pix she didnt care about losing
I gave that to my girlfriend had two bad cards they sent me one new card of the same size
None of the file removal programs will get the images off just make the item I am upset
In this day age of Ive used all of them had their file removal tech help give up
Do you want the only picture of your great grandmother lost because you used a Lexar I wouldnt I use an actual sandisk card myself
If they ever Lexar made it right I may have written a better review but they havent
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receiver itself is not very accurate
The Delorme software does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
I suspect that is because the cable it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
Real irritating out on the road as on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplish much
The card worked fine for my sons graduation and a family holiday but your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
If you have an iPod or other remember to backup became corrupted during my brothers wedding and I lost all the photos from that event
Before the repair process there the entire disk was unplayable
After the repair process was one bad track on my CD
With billions of CDs in the world is Coolpix S6 camera but the Fuji and Sandisk product did
This SD would not work in my Nikon this the best that the 21st century has to offer
I bought this card for my TJ25 supposedly a supported device
But the problems with this card make it nearly useless
Even if the browser DID work it would only work except display text you cant even fill in web forms with it so webmail searches etc
The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora which doesnt do anything for 30 days before you had to buy the full version
The card is designed to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail software that comes with Internetenabled CLIE devices
obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card
The card wouldnt connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors often stop responding and then lock up the handheld
While attempting to connect the card would even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either no additional configuration required
Bottom line if i used this CD the sound from my system did seem to be a little better the CDs were not skipping as much
ive given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after you want a webenabled PDA buy a webenabled PDA
but the bottom line is it didnt fix the problem as the fact that my set has a 6disk CD changer
not sure if this has anything to do with the CDs are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before
I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2
I like it but the flash card doesnt slide in easily
Sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk
To add insult unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins
Therefore they SHOULD work seamlessly together but pathetically they dont
Id much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing
For comparison give at all but instead is an effortless process
There is no my camera accepts the card perfectly
Surprisingly the reader doesnt topple over as easily as I thought it would
It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in
Sliding the card in card from the PCs drive and then remove it
Eject the a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in
Overall Im glad the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
I hate to have it but its an annoyance to use it
I wouldnt waste my money what I paid it was pretty cheap its not worth the effort
I wish I could return them to amazon but for on any more of these POS discs
2 of 10 LCD owners have called for in home service
Myself and other were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008
00 to come to your home if you do earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency
The LCD is easier to use than the not have the extended warranty and can not guarantee a fix
You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas
Even then if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage its going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work
Mostly you cant use this with a cover on and youll need a car charger if you want to use it for long
The allinone modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution
I had two of them and to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement
The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping they both broke within the first month
It is incredibly slow by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that Ive used
It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files
I attempted to copy 50MB 1500 was painful as well taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything
Deleting the files files 800 directories to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy Thats roughly 27Ksecond
For kicks I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive by the drives small physical size large capacity and price point it simply doesnt perform
Bottom line is dont be fooled and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds
I wanted to replace a Lexar 2300 file My Documents folder to a new PC
I used it to transfer a 700MB 1GB with this but Ill keep looking
The transfer seemed pretty slow Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
Product MP3 but deleting those files from the Sandisk took 61 minutes Back it goes
11132006 0751 am When will I get my repaired or replaced item
You have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status
Please respond by the way Apple on the M240 you received on 113
1113 Still waiting for an update turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
I bought this stereo because of its relatively small I received would not turn on at all
The first unit size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it
I contacted Philips tech support a very nice return policy and I sent it back to them instead
Fortunately Amazon has and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense
Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement which didnt seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing
The replacement stereo arrived in short order and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality right away without waiting until they received the defective unit
After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMTNE3 bookshelf stereo that I own here are my thoughts
Both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length
The Philips stereo however the two stereos I found that the Philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the CMTNE3
Playing the same song sidebyside on would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room my body interfered with the reception
The Sony significant distortion in the highfrequencies on the Philips stereo making S sounds sound more like H sounds
Also there seemed to be system had a much fuller and richer sound quality
I also noticed an occasional of the Philips stereo are not so good
The ergonomics crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input
For one thing the get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove
If that happens the CD can stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped
The electronically actuated CD door is so but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening
The volume goes up to 31 or much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the toploading CMTNE3
This means that there than I was expecting though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it
Finally the stereo is a bit bigger are only 4 quieter volume levels which is rather limiting
I am in the longer sells the CMTNE3 which I bought just about a year ago
Unfortunately Amazon no process of returning this stereo and I will try to find a Sony system instead
I dont understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly
Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs
I have to rate this on it I called the company
Less than 300 hours product and this company as horrible
It just blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should be
Additionally the fan diedwhich may be why the lamp blew
Maybe there was a problem with the mounted and never moved since it was first put in place
The projector was ceiling fan a year ago when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldnt look at it No
The company keeps sayingIt is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product
I will get a new projectorI can buy a new one NOTWILL NEVER be an Infocus product
My new projector WILL for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one
Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
I emailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it is now I have given up on it being repaired it was under warranty and am now
my projector stopped working 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector
struggling to get it back it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
the Better Business Bureau so that I can repair it out of my own pocket
I was hoping for a because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AAs ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AAs lasted only a week
Im amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers Ive found that they run out of juice incredibly fast
Be warned that these arent service I have ever experienced
The worst customer quite the bargain they may initially seem
The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect Viking cheats
This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned
After one year is sometimes it doesnt want to connect at all
The mouse now loses connection sproadically and when all of the problems started
I have changed the battery quite a now given up and am shopping for a replacement
It is very tempremental and I have few times and that doesnt seem to help
So a word to the wise up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer
It always freezes in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so
0 but work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time
The Xpress functions dont this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
Most of the interaction with the remote is done on when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
I had no problems burning to these discs its the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
This is true NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
I CAN for all the discs about 150 of them
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best
I dont know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use
I have to buy another software package to sell something false advertisement is not the way
If your going to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included
You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same
This is my main problem the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there
1 The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built
They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about
They are fairly light weight meaning very small magnets in them
These are 3 way speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to be 2 way
2 The sound input consists which is meaningless since the speakers suck
3 Its advertised as 320 watts of a headphone type jack in FRONT
What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers
And in case you know some audio 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts log relationship
For some reason No user adjustable equalizer only presets possible
4 this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver
5 Cannot connect a different even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver
6 The receiver sucks pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping type of connections
I concur with the it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it Competively with the others meaning fat profit margins
This company nowadays makes other reviewer Death to Sony Shame on them for taking consumers for a ride
Im so with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center
They were great a HARD cover dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases
Somebody could have sat on greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card
I mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those it and it wouldve been fine
For your psp if the game is really important to you and you cant save it
Just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off
it will go did it right youll have the game right back in the place you left it
and hopefully if you on hold and next time you wanna play it again
The minor problem occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in
Frustration and wasted time will is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
The major problem is 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network
After twelve to that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
Once you unplug and plug back accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang
I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs but I dont the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours
I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering it down and back up it never reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged
Finally Amazon likes to keep the good did work again If you buy one go through the setup and if it doesnt work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON Dont waste your precious time trying to get a 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time
However YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional
If the product is in fact good it wont have many TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES
However look up all something is seriously wrong with this product
They should tell you that the bad reviews for this product
Not anymore It uses up ink like and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there
Do several deep cleanings no other yes it is great to have the individual tankswhich is why I bought the thing but now the print head isnt working right
The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed
Went to the canon website they dont even acknowledge this printer ever existed
Consumer reports rates worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer
Pictures come out very graney and its almost it a best buy but I disagree
I bought the Cannon to ratings are from people that JUST bought this MP3
five star replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon
I bought the all he had it in his back pack and some how it got crunched enough to never work again I was not happy
Whith in 3 weeks my sons was no longer working at white 512 for my son at the same time
Also in a few was a complete failure for Sony
And the main toggle months mine started to have issues
I accually removed the cover to the toggle and just this time and I will not buy another Sony
I have done a lot of research moved the joy stick under it to change songs or volume
The hold button that is part of this sliding door never than this would not happen Dont do it folks look into other options even my moms iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player
Maybe Sony should have given us a onoff button works I find the player dead in my gym bag all the time Apparently the door slides over a bit and the player will turn on FOR HOURS and than you have a dead player
First off let me against the purchase of the bean walkman
advise you state for the record that I only buy Sony but I have to
I purchased one in March able to return it because it broke
insurance and was 2006 and returned it September 2006 as I had purchased replacement
It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphones
The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable
I just cam from Las Vegas and format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP
I have tried to the sandisk has a disk error that doesnt allow for more photos after only using 40mb
Bad investment Would not recommend the product unless there RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
I have used DVD RW and CD is a way I can get a refund or an exchange
get about 50 RWs with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers
multiple CD rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasion
You have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart
I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem
In October 2004 I more photos and reviewed I immediately found a few images corrupted
After I had taken 20 bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon
format the CF before use there were alway corrupted images
I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer
I have recently bought two spindles of these discs these discs exactly the same as far as I can tell from which I burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one for a freind overseas
The kicker is that this spring I also ordered two spindles of and my computer Imac w Intel chiphardly outdated simply doesnt recognize themlike I never put in a disc at all
I have no idea what the deal as advertised but SanDisk does not send in MailinRebate
The card works is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs
Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode SanDisk sent when they already have the barcode
How can I resubmit me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode
In my experience with SanDisk I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted so you get mailin rebate 50 of the time with SanDisk
I think mailinrebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies
I bought this mouse expected a better product and durability from Microsoft
I really eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
Ive since bought a of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made
This was the worst purchase Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
It felt very light and but the performance was terrible
Not just the construction flimsy the definition of cheap plastic
It would work perfectly for about a half hour and defective one but I wouldnt take that chance again
Maybe I was just unlucky and received a then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes
I wish I could give this device a worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x
Something is wrong with the DVDs because are looking for 16x do not buy this one
So if you my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner
Its been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card tell me was that it had been shipped
When I contacted EMARTCRAP all they could was shipped from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order
I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete
Your are better off paying a higher price for better service
Cosmetically pleasing is about a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The included software is the only good thing you can say about this unit
The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again
This unit would be great few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a if it came out 7 years ago
After further research I found out that physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
In addition in you Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months
This is true NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
I CAN for all the discs about 150 of them
The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cdsdvds
I cant give a complete review of the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvd
How do I assign a rating As several other people have experienced my unit is also DOA
I received it plugged it in pressed clean and the motor started up
I popped open the cover put in it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
Whats worse is the unit case is glued together no way to open the disc I wanted cleaned and pressed clean again
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer
I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs
I dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
I purchased this flash card in June for my GPS memory
Card lost all its memory and was unable to take a new load
As with some of the other brand inverter at WalMart and it is much better
I bought a Vector reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter
This item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car
Eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets
The product not checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it
The mechanic who only did not work but blew out fuses in my car
I have written to purchase another thing from Amazon until my money is refunded
I will not your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail
About a year ago I got one of these to allow battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately
It has an alarm that sounds when your me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling
I figured that my car battery was thought Id try it out in other cars
Now that Im taking another trip I not fully charged or on its last legs
The thing is replace the battery you have to reload all of your data
Each time you dead doesnt do a thing when I plug it in
When this of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitterstyle adapter there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area
The sound quality was excellent and free adapter first arrived I thought it was great
The first day I expect it to last forever but less than an hour
I didnt used it for about 20 minutes total didnt have far to drive and it worked great
Yes it has a 1 year warranty just send the postage than you originally spent for the unit
Of course then youre spending more in unit back with a money order 6 to cover the return postage
I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it
I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try
I was excited that I had all my ipod music with need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable
My guess is I will me BUT after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where I couldnt listen anymore with it
No kidding The so if you order multiple items you wont know that youre being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late
Amazon doesnt itemize the shipping charges on your order shipping charge on these batteries was over 6
Delormes receiver works only with their software the receiver itself is not very accurate
The Delorme software does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers
Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home I found 3 instances where a facility as been initialized Delormes software sometimes is unable to find it
Finally with the receiver I have even after the device was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly
I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesnt seem to accomplish much
Real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
These Xtreme cd cases STINKsliterally I dont know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic but the smell is absolutely nauseous
I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away
In theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these 2 for me 1 for a friend I about 3 hours and that is not in a row
Ive only got this thing to work for cant say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness
Ive spent hours with this emails and phone calls customer service responded
After MONTHS of product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks
What a joke They told me the plug in the the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work
Gimme a break I shouldnt have to do unit and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in
I was impressed with this controller at first and found it to feel comfortable and work well
It was played with once and a while for about a month total 10 hours max
Some time after that the next time I went to use it it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick
I could not get it to center or even stay still it would just keep either steering the car like Burnout3 or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what
I tried it several times and it has never worked since
I fire it up once and a while to see if its still doing it and it does
I am very dissapointed in this and I was just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for 19
I think I paid about 45 locally for it and I pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller
99 that works a warranty claim if its even covered but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox drawer of extra stuff
I dont really feel like going thru and feels as good but is less than half the cost
I was going to go totally wireless S controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there
I instead bought some extra Microsoft 4 units and luckily didnt run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers
If the go get some more if I can find them locally
0 I might Pelican holds up model PL2050 version 2
I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it
I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two in that time you love it
but after a month just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment
The triggers its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with
Im just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isnt on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade
Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver
After the contoller started breaking cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when its on my lap sitting in a chair
I bought this item not to down i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air
Im very cord ended up breaking after a few months
HOWEVER the satisfied with its being able to accomplish that
Targus replaced it at no charge making a racket when I first turn it on
Now one of the two fans has started which is good but still a hassle
After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first
The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years
It lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to do anything with my xd card
It worked just fine for 34 days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable
The DVDs are a ripoff although Im counting on the REBATE to at least break even not counting my time
Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue
Just a Verbatims DVDR DL product made in Singapore
Id recommend poor product Velocity ought to be ashamed
As a rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
I havent submitted the note I can get other DVDRs to work just fine
I tried 4 DVDs with considered 2 models 12in1 Lexar and SanDisk
Before I bought this reader I different DVD writers and still doesnt work
I bought this not insert My GIG card into this reader
But I could reader to use mostly with Memory stick
I tried because my card was made not by Lexar by SanDIsk
May be hard trying not to break the card no success
I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12in1 SanDisk Reader
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service I got and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it
I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America Minneapolis MN a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play
Gee thanks Ill be rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price
Maybe if these were high end looking at another brand Apple stinks
But for Alkaline This battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
You can find AAA is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell
As you can see from the game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folder
I had a small other reviews the speed on this thing is pathetic almost to the point of nonfunctional when it comes to many small files
makes you wonder 256MB Mini before I bought this product
512MB Mini if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing
Performance wise long time to copy files from my computers
Its taking this particular product is not doing good
Even its taking long time to delete files from this disk
So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk
I doubt all to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive
Now Im planning the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB
Better buy some in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons
A moderate inconvenience was that once good one than wasting your time on this product
Product am When will I get my repaired or replaced item
11132006 0751 MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240
You have had the way Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY
Please respond by this for 1 week without notifying me of the status
1113 Still waiting use as my old system But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects
No where near as easy to for an update on the M240 you received on 113
But one of with system you use these labels can alter
is that regardless interesting thing someone mentioned earlier
the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disksburner or what
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making
It might be the weight but i think of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
Dunno but if you all its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing
I connected all the cables as instructed but it doesnt work the light is not on
These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card
There is nothing star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration
I have given a single wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality
Very Few camera support this technology more if your camera does not support this technology
SO why pay and one can easily get the same capacity 12x at 14 the mentioned price
Its not something great only took them a couple of days
Delivery was you can just throw away if it decides to stop working
The connector to cant recharge or connect the cpen to the pc
Without it you the cpen was for some reason cut in half
I called their if the product itself is greatIll never know now will I
I dont care main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours
If youre unable to receive support when you need em youre screwed
If youre just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and dont really care if youre on your own go ahead and try it
Otherwise buy a product rate this product and this company as horrible
I have to that you can trust on with respect to aftersales support
Less than 300 hours on it I called the company
It just blew againabout 700 hourshalf of what the life should be
Additionally the fan diedwhich when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldnt look at it No
Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago may be why the lamp blew
The projector was ceiling of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc
The company keeps sayingIt is out mounted and never moved since it was first put in place
They will not buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one
I will get a new projectorI can accept that perhaps this was a defective product
My new projector WILL customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties
Their service is overpriced and their technical support and NOTWILL NEVER be an Infocus product
The worst customer service I have ever experienced
The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor saidYou got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect Viking cheats
This item was promised to wants me to review it so here your are
Now Amazon me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera but was never delivered
This is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything youd hope for in an iPod dock
The iPod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves
After a little bit of use the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together
If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldnt stress the electronics Id give this thing 5 stars
But without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good
Luckily I didnt pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr
which worked every time and kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang
It has more than paid for itself in repaired CDs20 for an entire I always end up using it instead
The motorized version didnt come with any deep scratch sanding pads which I need about 25 of the time for a badly scratched disc
Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine and wont start turning so I have to squeeze it together to make it work
One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel button and it did not work straight out of the box
Beyond that setting it up takes time but is not difficult
I am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out
I have six devices connected to my HD television set
The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote
I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly
At this point the only thing that I use two NiMH chargers and sony batteries wont charge in them
I have the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV which cannot turn the TV on and off
They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers
They force you to buy their own nonstandard charger that probably wont again charge other brand batteries
Dont waste your money or support Sonys attempt to bring nonstandard products into a standardized market
Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
Once again Im amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product
These are terribly uncomfortable for my ears and dont really provide that great of listening experience
The frequency response seems muted until you use experience your mileage may vary as they say
But of course this is just my the largest possible surrounds and then they become distractingly uncomfortable
Personally I found my just stop working and also my
My two rear speakers Apple iPod phones to be better
I dont have any other rear speakers to try on the system
while the verbatim has burned well in 100 of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
I had no problems burning to these discs its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore
After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months
In addition in you physically hold for all the discs about 150 of them
This is true the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become
I CAN NOT NOT brand new asus burner even after updating the firmware
This media did not work on my RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH
Can capture analog video and produce cdroms but I expected the ability to produce DVD
Instead buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more
Uleads software is stable and its not a trial version
It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture
Pinnacles Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great year ago and can say long term risky cells
I got sucked into this deal about a if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy
It could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but Im
If these were free id still would not recommend them due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings
It is the discs its best to invest a bit more and get good media
Anyway now I think I must assume since my burner works fine with other brands
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years
Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit
Currently only ONE still well to allow you to save your work and shut down
These units work works I have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years
My G5 mac was so brands such as Belkin but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores
I cant comment on other UPS power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD
There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this past four years has been mixed
My experience over the may be a reflection of APCs popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand
These are not inexpensive loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear
If you really fear the units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes
I chose to switch have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance
Many users do not to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms
The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years
I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries
Prices vary from 15 on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable
Battery life depends on many factors so I dont begrudge APC for wear and tear to 50 depending on the vendor
I bought APC APC products but it may be a problem with this model
Im frustated with my branded batteries and cant explain why the recurrent failures
Just beware of for more than 6 months and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510
I had this card the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS
Then all of a sudden for no converter couldnt find the card either
My SDUSB reason I kept getting card error on my computer and digital camera a week ago
I had really good this Boombox over a year and a half ago
I purchased photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good
What I do like nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last
It would be about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback
You cannot rewindfast forward in the song in Mp3 song again but I will have to play the entire song again
sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a format but you can do it with a regular audio cd
I no longer have the over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place
This thing was slipping and sliding all remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore
The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the hold feature is the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod
The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off
I bought it because it is one of with and buy one of the more expensive options
I think Ill just get it over the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is admin
Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in
The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted
After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network
Once you unplug and hangs but I dont accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang
I am used to rebooting Windows every time it plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours
I ordered the 2year service plan on May 1st this day July 31st I still have not recievied it
I have contacted them a number of times and still nothing
I purchased this item and one month of money for a number of reasons
This is a complete waste later I still have not received any paperwork
This hub will charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub
So forget being able to not work with any USB powered devices
Be aware that if you want ipods for my wife for use on walks etc around town
i purchased the DLO action jacket neoprene for 20 40GB to connect your printer scanner ipod etc
The circle that is supposed doesnt align either so you cant press the play button
The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and to line up with the ipods doesnt
So since the ipod time and money and consider another ipod case
pls save your doesnt fit in the case overall this product is useless
Not anymore It uses up ink like and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there
Do several deep cleanings no other yes it is great to have the individual tankswhich is why I bought the thing but now the print head isnt working right
The pages have splotchy website they dont even acknowledge this printer ever existed
Went to the canon black marks and the texts are only partially printed
I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive
Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room
The sound is soso and also very big taking up 12 my nightstand
It is it has no battery backup lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing
The final straw was that it has trouble accepted reality and tossed it in the trash
This morning I finally gave in tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live
We bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didnt have battery back up called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks
how bizarre They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center Boxed it up and its going right back where it came from
If its okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however whats the use in having an alarm clock if you cant trust that it will indeed wake you up
I would like to believe that this hub works well but I wouldnt know
I bought it to reduce clutter on my ipod and digital camera and nothing happened
I hooked up my printer desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac
I called one and doesnt say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website
It doesnt come with Targus and they said I needed an ac adaptor
They said I could get it at radio shacks and online they dont carry it
Ive been to two radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2
I had was good but the dependability of this item is questionable
The sound quality to send this item back because it stopped playing cds
Good thing first efficient on batteryconvenient and compact
doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge
As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY
I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software
even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks songs on this player from my computer
I had 1gb of Atrac are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy
I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman
Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer
the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back
I tried every trick and even of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money
It is a rotten piece the sony customer support could not help me a very indifferent group of people
Of course transfering the files there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected
I have an Iriver T10 and to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that
First of all the 2 or 3 days but I had several problems with it
I did get it quickly shipping on this item costs more than the item itself
1 I repeatedly to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond
Each time I had tried it on my DVD player and the player hung
I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well
2 I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time
Had to CtrlAltDel to get my DVD player software to close
3 I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer
It is difficult side once they have been opened once they dont reclose very well
On the flip not to break them when first trying to open them
I have used rerecordings NOT 1500 2 may crap out on any occasion
get about 50 DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders
multiple CD RWs with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers
The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful
There is no direct Macintosh program rather there are templates
They were written for old versions of software and really dont work right
The Windows side this make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint
If you do get includes an actual Print Shopstyle program which works awfully
I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex shame on you
after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement
of course you want business to fix things but to make money not fixing things
really not in the a hard copy that is why you bought it
If you it forget about it they aint gonna fixreplace it whatever
you dropped had anything to do with the device not working e
They have a very sparce network of repair companies over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N
Lastly they tend to screw so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginiaof course you have to pay for the shipping
W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N
W will take months to pay them for the work they did
If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
will waste your time money and your every last nerve before repairing your product
Eventually they will but not without an exhausting protracted fight
Im not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty someodd dollars and was handed a coupon for a 40 rebate
But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic your voice doesnt come through the speaker
Im cool with the machines sound quality when it comes to playing a CDG
If I tap the mic I can hear an extremely dinosaur a boom box in the age of the iPod
Which makes this a faint thud so I know its on but the volumes too lowand yes I adjusted the mic controlsif you want to sing along
Really had to dig through the stacks of writeread that card to transfer some big files between computers
Also occationally I use a card reader SimpleTech to machines to find a box that hadnt been opened
Its all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full few pictures I could move on
Fortunately after I delete a and after a card reader reading I got CF card error on my camera
I gave the card purchased another Viking 512MB half year ago
After that I to other people so I dont know how its doing now
I used it to error message on my camera even after reformat for several times while I dont have that problem if I use another card
Now I am getting consistent CF card transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet
One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card
Anyway I will have to buy another card now and it wont be viking for this time
They gave me not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt
They did a number for return and I mailed back my damaged CF card
I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters
I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters
I bought these discs at CompUSA 25 bucks because out of 5 discs I got one that burned good
Well I just wated a good because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online
I have burned many with these discs making coasters
Very disgruntled discs but never Memorex usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM
Maybe my burners dont like them but whatever the case I wont buy them ever again
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether
I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft
Ive since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it
Being a graduate student and living more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them
50100 pages per month is a in an apartment I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments
The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition
I use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq
It takes forever ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera
Bought this a month to copy anything to and from it
After that everytime I on the camera with my previous purchases from Amazon
Im always so confidence it wanted me to reformat the cardWTH is that
One mistake I madeI threw away sayIm too over confident with LEXARs products
Needless to the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card thought It worked and It would be OK
I record dvd movies as w next to no coasters but figured Id upgrade and go with memorex this time around
Id been using Ridata for some time a hobby and am always looking for better media software etc
I have had to recopy at least 5 appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media
Were it a compatibility issue I could understand but it out of the last dozen or so movies Ive done
I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a satellite provider that did offer HDTV too many trees around my house
didnt offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a HDTV only to find out that my cable co
I wasnt expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought
When I first turned in on signals into an amazing HDTV picture but for 550 I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable
She looked at ONquot This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it
I said quotit IS the TV and said okay Im ready turn it on
The image I got for some instances I though the picture was worse
In fact in my digital cable was certianly different but thats all it was different
I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter
So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got that is what the product is best for even though thats not what I got it for
It didnt matter what display format I put it in it just didnt do anything to improve the picture
If you cant get HDTV dont expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit
The included software is a reminate of the late 80s to early 90s
The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP
Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again
This unit this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD
I just recently bought would be great if it came out 7 years ago
Out of the version 7 which does a great job with my CDs so Im pretty sure its the DVD media
I use Roxio CD Creator past 20 burns I have only had 10 DVDs burn successfully
Not only am I wasting all burn speed but it does not matter
Ive tried to lower the my money but my time as well
I ordered this until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up
I though this would save me money because on the recommendation of another Amazon customer
I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results
It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs
I dont think damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON Many of my CDs I have replaced for 710 bucks on here
My suggestion would be to just replace your this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched
Not sure if I just but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button
It worked right most of the time got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again
I would have to turn the unit on the unit decided it was time to stop working
Its now about 9 months later and and off to get it to reset and work correctly
Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for
Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand
Hi I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006 and was and I cannot change it anymore What happened When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings 1 and
After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks and unplugging it the region code has automatically set back to 1 able to set the region code to 0 to watch all DVDs
As with some of the Vector brand inverter at WalMart and it is much better
I bought a other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter
AMAZON FAIL FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOOD
THE ITEM TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME
The sound was great the features I need but its mp3 player is really bad Audio just pops before moving to a next song
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all but the DVD would lag every 1015 seconds during any and all movies
It looks like what Philips people just do in all of their electronics
I really dont want to talk about this any more because William R
When I first 2 for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys
I have been playing BF2 Battlefield heard about this board I was incredibly excited
So it was a godsend to be games and applications is quite intriguing the first that I have seen
The interchangable keysets for different able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game
But the price for well but dont expect this to replace your home keyboard
The board is constructed each is kind of high but well worth it
The Windows Keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any runofthemill keyboard at best with the gaming keysets
Ingame typing is difficult but it is awkward to type with I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard
With most of the gaming keysets the keys M keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other
like UJ and on the left 12 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 12 side they are all vertical not staggered
When you push them down they dont bounce back as much
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board and the BF2 keyset 9 keys went completely dead
I tried to reinstall has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit
I contacted support and it the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail
DUH They are reviewing my warranty but but I dont think I am getting a new base unit
Maybe this post is premature most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day
The expression Great Idea Bad Execution holds true here
Ideazon has too many issues not enough support staff and a website that doesnt do anything but look good
Sleek design super any problem loading or playing until last week
Never had user friendly sharp image and easily unlock to all region
Went completely a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
It wouldve been dead for no reason in the middle of a movie
The player stopped working after only a few months it up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go
That behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them
We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash
Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping
This one lasted time and money and buy another machine
Save your less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste
I would like reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac
I bought it to to believe that this hub works well but I wouldnt know
I hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened
I called Targus and they said I needed an ac adaptor
It doesnt come with get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2
They said I could one and doesnt say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website
Ive been to two radio now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers
I bought these thinking they were a good deal but shacks and online they dont carry it
I bought 24 of these and died maybe had six recharges on them each
The ones that one year later I have four left that will take any sort of charge
I also have several high end chargers that dont want anything to do with the ones that died
On the bright side I have several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been A after 2 years
I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now
These batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives
I dont know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is but with that since I have dozens of them I dont care if it runs out faster
To be short the performance is less than great but OK but I can live these didnt last being on the shelf for a little over a year
But what I couldnt stand if that it also set my as a travel charger for my Blackberry
I bought this charger on fire since one of them leaked I couldnt imagine what would happen if I didnt come to my desk in time
I followed instructions in I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it chargedbig mistake
After waiting twice as long as required the manual which are pretty easy and charged up the Solio
Not only did it not charge a weird several days with the same result rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous
I tried this routine several times over red battery icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed
Finally I had enough and told the CC company to handle it no one ever said what the problem could be
Not only did they never return my money I had to call my customer service for Solio that I was returning it
My advice Stay away from this thingit 2 more cards to his connector problem
Musselman can add may seen cool or environmentally friendly but it is junk a piece of overpriced junk
I have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna I plan to return it all
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all
I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer
Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while
It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD
Apparently Sony didnt do proper quality testing on this product
I returned mine returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken
But after buying and and after these other reviews wont be replacing it with a Sony
I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchase but in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a CD and quitting
The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews When playing CDs because this unit is a Sony I trusted it would be a superior product
I followed the advice of and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very highpowered pop and around here country stations
The one I just bought has an analogue tuner another reviewer and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changer
The tuner this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks
I bought requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial
Upon the joyful news that we were still works greatthe printer is another matter
The digital camera having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer
While this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes
As we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink
Replacing every cartridge at once will run you also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally
The gray ink is used up the quickest and has about 75 at a time give or take a few
The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink but for only about the first 5070 pictures
The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of registervery frustrating when youre printing out any pictures let alone ones of your child
Yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to
Every other time get us no results and we are still to clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion
In the long run I will not be in the beginning but doesnt hold out for the long run
Qualitywise it gets you buying a photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store for processing
My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me
I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week
Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured not the purchase date
I call HP support and was told that my printer was out of such as yellow faces and hands no proper flesh tones
I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had
I was given a case number but when I called HP back stating my case number they said that this was no longer a free call
I explained it was an and would not purchase another HP product as long as this policy stands
I think HP warranty policy stinks extension of the first call but they refused to work with me
But when really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks
It is really it is recording forget about changing channels
Broadband feature is nice but USB doesnt come cheap
A clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use
I have the older models CD Clock Radio and they are nice but the new model is irritating
I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system
I cant keep a system that I have to locate a remote to operate
I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK
I AM A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR
I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE
COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY
This carrying case worked well for me until I jumped in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it causing my iPod to fall to the pavement
It turns had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up I still cant get more than a 20db signal from my guitar
After finally figuring out that I out the clip isnt fastened on all that securely
Installed it easily but module hasnt been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only I wouldnt recommend this memory for dell 700m users
I contacted kingston and they said that this once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen
Huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily
This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP in order for it to stay visable to your computers
Second problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare and even at 35feet from the AP the unit is around 1136mpbs
Do not buy this product find another company who stands behind there products
All of my know how to help you and email support is a joke
People on the phone dont contacts with them have landed me somewhere in India
I bought the Zire 72s as going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them
Often when I turn it on it has lines an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with
Customer support is one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them
I even sent it to them at terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems
After my experience days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over
This thing worked for two with this Palm I will never buy Palm again
We thought it was the battery getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
I am not even going to bother going bad but a new battery didnt help
I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years
While some Linksys units have worked for me more often I have found them undependable
In particular the WPS54GU2 set up fine but THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR Total JUNK
THIS IS THE THIRD ONE I almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time I printed
I bought this HD because my Lacie which great although it was very large and heavy
Out of the box this product looked had lasted over 5 years crashed on me finally
I immediately plugged it in several more times and it wouldnt boot up
I tried to test it and it came up however that was the one and only time that it booted
VERY VERY scary when you buy a be the one that sucked but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data
I dont know if this product just happened to new device to hold all you important data and it wont boot up out of the box
I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon
Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone
I record my violin pieces on my and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike
But I wanted a more sensitive recording laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this
The gain was lower than the ordinary mike it doesnt work me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain
Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres wholl entertain at all without the battery but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory
SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared card would bring my sounds back
I thought this new sound with Vista upgrade save for the Windows startup music
Might have but it says not compatible with Vista
are you serious I bought this a while ago to see if it was cool
It is a piece of junk u can in your car you have to cover it because the back light is too week
if you want to watch it barely get any channels and even if you do you can barely see them and it has loud static
The item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so was NOT as universal as advertised
I was disappointed it I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks
once I got the tv up it is ok and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks
I did find out there is another one that it takes two to lift it up as it should for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady
I had to return the first may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also
Now it looks like I tv to the store and round up help when I got a replacement
This whole thing with the Theyre made by CMC Magnetics well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world
These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blank media Ive EVER encountered mount and tv has been very frustrating
But not only are they CMC Magnetics faced with these forcing a hard reset
The latest KProbe hangs when theyre the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics
The latest Nero Burning when I use these and an attempt to abort hangs Windows XP SP2 the same way it hangs Kprobe
The program continues nonstop to display waiting for media ROM hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset
Curiously the media IDs on these are are recognized by all my software and hardware quite unlike the Verbatims
However at least the Philips exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CDR media theyre made by CMC Magnetics as well
Thats why I are no prize either but they perform minimally well
The Philips say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics
The ONLY point of labeling discs you cant even RECOGNIZE let alone burn
But whats the thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling
I had the exact same problems with these media in both my LiteOn LH201AH burner and when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden
Note that Verbatim had a great reputation my NEC ND2510A burner the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even lowquality media
But stupidly they chose large files between work and home but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of
I found this be very handy to have around to transfer to go ultracheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp
Im glad be fooled by the flashy metalliclooking picture
Do not I back up my data in more than one place
The plastic shell at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting
One would think that for 300 the company would of this device is the quality of McDonalds toys
In order to turn the device extremely flimsy and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place otherwise the connection will be lost
The cable port for the DocuPen is also on you have to press very firmly which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell
I am a premedical student and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in see that this belief was naive to say the least
However I now this product believing that I could for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk scan my science textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that way I thought I would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least 100 each
The words come out distorted like a jammed fax machine and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary until you load them into the computer you will have to rescan about 80 of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibility
Furthermore downloading is very slow at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer and since you cant see how your scans have turned out with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDFs the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate
I wish I had read some of a lot of money and time
I would have saved myself the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product
If you are a user who is only looking to scan visions of going allout paperless with this product you will find yourself extremely disappointed
If you have been harboring grandiose pictures or a few flat documents then this product may work okay for you although a digital camera will probably deliver better results
Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to of potential especially when coupled with a Tablet PC
The idea is wonderful and has a lot invest in a semidecent shell manufacturuer it will not a good buy
However the execution of the idea needs improvement
I hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years at a price that is comparable to quality
The paper is just heavyweight paper if itd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board
which takes some effort not sure thats perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves
Reading this I cant make the template show rightside up
No you can save you an hour of your precious time
to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS
Im not kidding I guess you could also turn your monitor on its side
You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should
So youll have to turn your head or monitor back and forth sideways
What kind of company would sell such a product
if youre looking for templates for the DVD Inserts
Another thing is that there isnt a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd
I was wrongly advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo
Be sure your computer is supported because Targus tech wont and now consider myself lucky I didnt keep it and try to make it work
I just now read the other reviews give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you cant safely maake it work with an unsupported computer
After about 3 way to keep a large amount of backup data saved however I have fought with the drivers for days now
I bought this product as a weeks of operation the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy
Whenever the drive is working the usb on my disappointed and will not be buy netgear again
Im very computer does not work if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes even with the newest updates I will be returning this product ASAP
This was my second Netgear product I bought previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed The idea of a network storage appeals to me
In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing and be careful on the drives you buy for it
Well I searched and searched and found pretty well but that is where everything started to go down hill
Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went a drive that worked and bought both yesterday
Midway through the install it tells you to okay any error do so oh well and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot
Figured it would have told me it was going to messages which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors and suddenly my computer reboots
Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers
To quote Netgears web site SCSI disk drivers drive you put in to the SC101 you need to look in to your own computer
Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives
My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers
Back in the box the SC101 goes when you have trouble it suggests and none work
Tried the 3 things and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me
This is up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own fault and Id have to pay to have that crp yes he said it from my system
I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick where I get really frustrated Netgear support
I needed to hire a local and went through huge mood swings during the call from happy to argumentative to depressed to happy again
The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand computer vendor and it would be my bill
I was freaked that needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market
After reading up on it and now experiencing it I think it this person knew my home address
It really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
everything works fine except for two flaws in Excel on the numpad the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key
this is unacceptable i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games
logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings
I live in FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up
This unit could not receive normal San Francisco and have generally good radio reception
and I used the fancy and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired meaning 3 or 4 second dropouts
Sometimes the audio skips Dipole antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna
I purchased the Recepter Radio with lots of very strong HD signals this radio had trouble finding them
Even in the Denver market HD a year ago used it for a weekend and returned it immediately
Id be listening to a strong station and the radio HD radios available when I bought it
This was one of the few would lose lock go silent and rebuffer before coming back to life
I have since purchased a Sangean HDR1 and love it
Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista
Got this message One of the USB devices attached it didnt work at all
After one successful printing to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it
This cable seemed the above It is flimsy doesnt stay in adjustment rattles around when you move and looks cheap to boot
What more can I say than to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected
Tilting the foot rest rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot
Its just cheap plastic back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world
There are many I consider them annoyances but not killers
For me aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives
I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it
More memory is always good but the T5 isnt on the hurting side
Its not a good mp3 player with the memory it has
And even if you have a 2G card with mp3s its not like this is what you would buy for MP3s
But as far have just found out is these are known to die
The problem as I as contact information on the go applications etc
I havent heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die
It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to even a factory state
You will have a Palm Powered logo screen it back to Palm for them to make it better
If you are under warranty you can send with a small black line flashing on the top
This is a ran into this I would have rated this a 45
Until I serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for
Until this happened the device it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi
I read the box before buying it and knew did what I expected it to do
But it has one of the fastest processors available at that time in a PDA
works well enough I havent had any issues with it
You can surf the net your device is going to be working the next day it really
But if you cant trust with bluetooth so wifi isnt really that big of a deal
I dont want to 6 months then just refused to start was replaced under warranty
First T5 lasted buy another Palm after this experience but I am not sure what to
This one locked up after about 3 months was replaced again under warranty
Its now out of warranty and wont start or reset
The first same problem again but Im not spending 169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5
I guess its the 2 times Palm told me the ROM had failed
Out of the box I think its headset from retailer offline and returned it the next day
I bought this a good PDA so check those 4 and 5 star reviews to see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy
First off I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound
Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger they use 40mm drivers the sound quality of the headset was just fine
However when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sin
The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears and a bad seal on closedback headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation
Also I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads but it is nowhere near soft enough
in fact I litterally couldnt wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red flush from discomfort
Mind you I also own a cheap pair of Koss hurt to wear after a very short period of time which isnt good at all
but these things they just plain headphones I can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either
Discomfort and being unable to obtain tough you should have no problem with this headset
If your ears are a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return
The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you
However if youre looking for comfort and good sound isolation youll want to look elsewhere
I dont recommend these for 1st person shooter gamers
Impossible to tell if enemy is in front or behind you
Probably ok if direction of sound is not important to you
Left and right work ok but not frontrear for some reason
The use of this AC power radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost
On battery the adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless
I bought this card and the Belkin PreN wireless router in Nov
Everytime they asked me to reinstall the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked
I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and reinstalling drivers again and again
Then finally Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement
I pointed out that I should not them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive
I have shipped have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th
I wouldnt waste my time ordering this product from Amazon
THIS SITE IS difficult to email you regarding things I cant find
Dear SirMadam Its very HARD TO FIND THE INK CARTRIDGE I NEED
Or you dont which ink I need No way you can tell
Now you tell me sell I am looking for HP black ink
Because you are NOT between scenes and what not their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference
When the screen is black selling or what You site is very difficult to find Ink I need
Buy a different one it back when I read the other feedback on this page
I opted not to send this one is just not up to the task
I didnt want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed as the other fellow did below
Amazon is usually pretty good not this time and not on this product
Now Im stuck with a antenna with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dads new tracheostomy
This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer I did not order nor do I want
Problem is it puts out TOO much mist even at the lowest setting Weve tried everything including taping the hole care of my dad that everyone using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem
Of course it wasnt until we started mentioning it to the various RNs that come to take but it then goes from all to nothing because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through
Ive resorted to making large be seeded by bacteria but if anyone has a better suggestion Im all for it even if it means suggesting a different humidifier
Not a great way to do it and just asking to hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dads mask
so Im paying 300 for a settop box with a 40Gb hard drive but I cant use it as a you can play it on the Apple TV
if it isnt in your iTunes library DVR Why not Also the only content I can play on this settop box is content that comes through iTunes Thats right
This means you caqn play your DVDs you cantt play see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV
Also make sure you saved DVD iMovie or other movie files you cant play anything unless it has been successfullyy added to your iTunes library
If you dont have one you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen it wont go to the edges and be borderless so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box
Any pros It has to be the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item
also I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my be that easy without having to configure something but it was
I didnt think it would part it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computer was also plugged into
This will be a to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better
Right now its time good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability
if this had only cost me 100 peeling possibly from the uneven heat
The left palm pad keep or 150 I would probably keep it however
This make the protection pad a lot less useful than one would
The software on the pc side doesnt work well at all
Wont list all needs a skip function to fast foward through movies
The remote my files and I cant get it to update changes or new folders
It continues to blow the other reviews some glowing others well
I read away any of the media players I have purchased
The price was right reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself
I read the other 149 50 rebate So I thought I would take a chance
First off I am only interested in playing videos from my computer so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works
I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections
My house is fully wired to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton
I was able to get the device connected with CAT5 therefore I am using this product wired not wireless
It found the tversity server right away to view a folder of VOB files as a movie
Neither server tversity or the Dlink were smart enough and I was able to see the contents listed
So for example I clicked on my Casablanca folder I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie
When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes it did not go to VOB_2
I needed to review stated the FF simply does not work properly
As another use the remote and manually select the next item to play
Oh sure the movie is FFwding the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB
If you press play while if you press FF the movie will fast forward
This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device
Which I will be doing first thing in the morning
My final advice to to DLink Great idea but your product absolutely sucks
My final advic any prospective buyers S T A Y A W A Y
Oh one more thing Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly
Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly their English was terrible
oh come on just one guess It least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients
I could hear at also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another
Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me
She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over
Sheesh I must have read my phone number to the packaging they mention Nero recode CE
One last interesting tidbit on her at least 4 times before she got it right
Nero has a list and purchase one the Nero certified product instead
I will return this DLink junk of Supported Media Players listed
I bow my head in to configure and then none of the settings would stick
It was a pain shame As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway
Whenever I changed the default password it item so I can get something decent
Returning this would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset
bad customer service its been twice noone really helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones
ive sent 3 emails and called almost a month and i still have not received this product
i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it
im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help
I put it into the cassette player in my car and the sounds were completely distorted
The voice constantly skips and the casette sometimes clicks
The quality of sound in my car it if shipping doesnt cost more than the product itself
I plan on returning is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device
I have 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced
After that I made a DCS900W camera that failed within a year
Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that dont seem to care about the service that much and usually after a couple of transfers the line got cut off or picked up by another layman
During conversation the line quality is very bad
After a while I just process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau
I am in the decided that 100 camera is not worth the time of the calls
Based on my experience I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from DLink
Once you have any problem they just wont honor the waranty
I was pretty disappointed with the that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt
First I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case Tune Belt because of two main reasons
That wasnt such a big deal since small for my arm I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training but nothing outrageous
But then I went to wear it for a run and the armband was too it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve
I would have thought have larger than average biceps say 17 amd up save your money
So if you that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users
i bought my monitor yesterday and found days the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting
After having installed the unit for 43 to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness lt100
This was a spantaneous as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks buyer beware
Tomtom would not replace the unit break while driving sending the unit Flying Very dangerous
See hopes knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle
I ordered this television with high the TomTom forum for description and picture
Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1 2006 shipped with bad firmware
For me it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on it turned itself off and never turned back on again
Resets system resets power TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase
A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp cycling unplugging components didnt help
For them the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled
I say a visit because Sharp does not cover inhouse technician visits for TVs under 32 a fact they to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV
So here I am 10 days later and hundreds vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either
Instead it sits at the authorized service center because Sharp obviously does not of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it
Im willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 412006
Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one
If it begins with a 501512 601 602 or 603 immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp 1800BESHARP regardless of and it has been 23 months i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit
i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen i sent it back whether or not youre experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully while Sharps warranty is still in effect for you
It was great for the first week then it made my computer crash and now I cannot get it installed again
I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase
Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware software or other products like this one
Now having problems with the product is one thing but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats
Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online working after 3 months I did get it to work again
My MP3 player stopped store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month
Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems
OK so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem no go
Oh and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone
Save yourself some frustration and get something better
iriver maybe was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it
I bought this Mp3 player because it Just stay away from Creative Lab products
It is a stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to
The firmware decided to piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months
Now I have a 200 dollar mp3 player with frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product
So if your into extensively troubleshooting highly no music on it that will not interface with my PC
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies I have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case note that the discription says sturdy padded handle NOT
5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you dont need one
no help from computer type with network experience and this one for the books
I am a savvy their support staff on phones nor online QA
This product has a known defect for Order and it was serial number R635
I just received my Amazon serial numbers R641 and less see Logitech website
Hopefully Amazon will the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out
These are some of cleanse its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customer base
Voices are muted highs they are marketed as surround sound yeah right
The ONLY redeeming feature is since are muddy and lows are nonexistant
they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers
Maybe mine was broken but I dont think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends
I connected the splitter to my sound card a TB Montego DDL with clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card
Both the 6 and 30 cables delivered great a 1 cable and then tried both a 6 and 30 cable to my stereo
I even used only the 6 and 30 cables in case the 1 was bad
I think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter
Cheap and definitely nasty they may look ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on
In general when placed over the nice and robust given the hardened plastic earcups but after a few months light use I lost sound through one cup then the other
The batteries seemed to last pretty for the price this is hardly unexpected
Very disappointing but long though actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself
I was happy airplane rides really helps cut out that background engine noise
Great for with the noise canceling features not the best but definitely works
My problem however with these headphones too in a different place the deisgn of these just isnt very sturdy
the second set broke hwoever is the design the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus cheers to them
Im gentle with my stuff too get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor
It is almost impossible to so either I had bad luck wtwo defective units or theyre just not made well
I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month
Amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days before even getting the original back
But the replacement model froze this product As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than
To quote an email from Amazon regarding up after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund
we originally to print Not to mention when I turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed
If only I could get it thought we are not able to send another replacement
Ive tried options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing
Ive checked my over and over to try to print something
If your looking for a any that even come close to meeting my needs
I have not found portible printer you have other options and I suggest using them
I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years and anyone who had that hold equal number of title books as it does DVDs
I have been trying to find a good case been there knows that AFN sucks so DVDs is your only source of video entertainment
But that seems to be asking to much or the manufacturers know that read this and come up with real solutions cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied
I hope that some of the manufacturers by giving odd numbers you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly Then when you look at the furniture options everything seems to be made for function and not style at all they are generally pressboard P
This product will not fix up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor
I ended your disc I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problem worse
This is a poorly designed and manufactured product less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1
I had a Pronto NEO for that does not work I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it
The unit has a very surprised when it stopped working
I wasnt at all cheap feel especially for the price
The PC software that you a living and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen
The touchscreen is very tedious to customize I write software for use to customize the touchscreen is crap
I cant imagine the average consumer being able to customize this the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touch screen
The whole point of unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PC to the remote
Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit
Aside from the touchscreens fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote
Did I mention the buying another one if it sold for 30 or less
I might consider batteries did not last more than 2 months In short this product is crap
Whoever produced havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client
There is no point in this software seems to have missed the point
It would be similar two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network
In my case I already had to say allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet
The VPN software you how often I saw the blue screen of death during my repeated software installdeinstall efforts
Added to my woes I cant tell from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working
I am now returning have experienced this unit is no longer functional after 18 months
Like other users both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution
The wired base is still working the new year I dropped it onto pavement and it broke
A few months into but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights
For 99 Garmin couldnt play directions at full volume so I returned it for another refurb
Unfortunately the refurb unit replaced it with a refurbished unit which I consider a fair price
This unit fell off told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit theyd look at it under warranty
I called Garmin and was the windshield still in its cradle and it started making that frying sound of short circuits
I had told the guy what happened so unit was within specifications or words to that effect even though clearly not
Under all circumstances the report you get back says the returned I was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it
Units will be returned with the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled
For some new software keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to register even though you already have
It does not allow with maps Windows player or whatever its called would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes
On the first one every time I inserted the SD card you to load waypoints Points of Interest and the like
The fourth one has a problem common to see to reset the battery brightness to half on but this one resets them both to zero
The first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and the first one The brightness resets itself randomly to zero
So you may it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if its dark you need a flashlight
If youre outside you can put think the unit is not turning on but its on
The current one will do a hard reset if have to do the full new user routine
This means I I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle
Touch the screen on the little Olathe Kansas to where I live
Reset the time from plus signs to register the touch screen
All contacts will then find the satellites and get me where Im going but I cant load destinations from contacts as theyre gone so I have to type them all in by hand
After Ive gone through the restart routine the unit notes calendars and other information is lost
If the battery runs out screen where the plus signs are to register the screen
It forgets everything and I have to touch the of juice the unit is dead
Reset the time notes calendars and other information is lost
All contacts from Olathe Kansas to where I live
I complained about this to support at Garmin one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost
They recommended that I buy a program from and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it
So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data
I did learn though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you cant retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save as selfextracting archives
To restore I pop out the detailed maps SD card insert the backup card navigate to the File Explorer navigate to the SD card open the contents of the SD card select the latest back up click through the restore procedure click to OK that it has finished just a of contacts and without the unit knowing where Home is which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue
I cant do it while Im driving of course so if the unit resets on its own I just go with the complete lack minute or two with my small amount of data click to restart wait a long time for it to restart tap to get past the owner data screen enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then Im good to go
The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as I navigate the menu to the setting for north is up which I cant do while driving
Im sure this is my shortcoming and I then have to remember how to cant look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am visavis the map
It also defaults to different displays for day and night
The night display uses a dark background and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text
So I cant read the power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle
And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose menu selections against the dark display
On the contacts database the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe Kansas
I have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the xxx xxxxxxx format even though they are longer and dont start with an area code
In the calendar if I have meetings scheduled outside the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone
Then when I get there I have the option of choosing the visited time zone and all my time zone I enter them at the time theyre scheduled
So I never use the visited time tell me how to get to places that have no street address but for which I have the latlong coordinates
I have not found a way to have it zone feature and the unit assumes Im still in my home zone wherever I may travel
I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the the directions part of the M3 is excellent
On the whole map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out which loses the road
It gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper
On the whole using find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations
After a year of use Mobile and not Garmins fault but I cant put up with it anymore
Ill take Garmins word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows I cant put up with it anymore
Ill switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isnt Windowsbased and that doesnt completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesnt randomly do a hard reset doesnt randomly set the brightness to zero and doesnt assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe Kansas
Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and waypoints from other peoples files
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I have Directv signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD
Signal was less than 60 for some of the transponder with HD 5 LNB and the signal was low
The signal strength wasnt I put them in relation to the dish and receiver
It didnt matter where improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well
However I was removing has only a oneyear warranty so I was outofluck
The company the plastic tips which need to be changed every several months and the headphones broke
Again I thought the sound was great but for this price I would expect them to be more durable
Also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times
Just received display and good illumination while on AC adapter
adequate LCD radio yesterday and am returning radio today Pluses
However the volume slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of 56 there is a BIG noticeable increase in volumenot good feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome the Eton E5 seems worse still I am returning this today and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead
Also on FM if hands are near the radio the signal breaks upfor weaker signals not strong ones and compared to my Grundig 400PE which I and while tuning shortwave bands every approx 100Khz increment there appears to be a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speaker
Eton E5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if use it is stuck in 45 rpm mode
After about 3 months of light comparing it to another similar size radio and then comparing it to my Sony 2010
I sometimes use my thumb to garbage in which case this is right your alley the Garbage Alley
Dont buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning slow down the player to 33 rpm mode
I wouldnt even the case after few days as I was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices
After buying this product I opened give this to a bum because I would feel bad about it
However every time I put it in the camera or other devices it gives error and doesnt work
I couldnt use this memory stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receiptI am not sure how I can even return it back either
Basically not computer very sluggish even when my laptop is not running off of the battery
The light makes my at all happy with the product at this time
Browsing the internet especially yearsI found the need for a more duable label than my M tape was providing
After owning a Ptouch labeler for is painfully slow and I am on a highspeed cable connection
What a mistake The only thing well designed about this unit is its abilty be screwed each time you push the print button
00 a rollprepare to to waste more tape than it uses If you print a label of any sizecount on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it At 20
Then go find the scissors and cut the excess offso the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk But cheer up you can push six buttonsevery timeto reduce the margin to narrow
This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the labeland print two small dots on the other sidethis will show you where to cut it with your scissorsto match the narrow side
Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY timeAnother great featureit will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print sizeso you will only print large print
I used to make lots of labelsand now I only make labels for VERY important items
And only when allow us to give items a negative five stars You have been warned
I really wish amazon would I am up to getting mad for doing so
While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features Ive blanked out after only several months of use
the screen on one of our handsets especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets weve found it to be extremely unreliable
the handsets go out of range when one takes them from the base and have to be reset this has only become a problem in the past month
the handsets randomly become unregistered only a modest distance from the base even though we have the base in the middle of our house the handsets dont work at the ends and our house is not that big
The issues weve had with this phone have frustrated us the great features and because Ive had good luck with other Motorola products
I bought this phone for so much that we are now shopping for a new phone usually wed expect such a purchase to last longer than two years
The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have
The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit
The only way to get them working again I cant talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located
Range on the handsets is only mediocre is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings
Overall the phones are very disappointing house because Patricia wife in wheelchair and on oxygen 247
Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout and I would definitely recommend not buying them
She could most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls third phones quite often in searching mode when picked up for use
First sound terrible second after 1 month beep all phones in emergency and I would hear
Entered house to find room for different brand phone and called 911
SEARCHING Stopped CPR and ran to another wife unconcious and not breathing
Patricia DIED in spite of my and 911 personnels efforts
Looking for someone I hate to give these 5 phones my last Motorola product
There should have ordered both pieces was unclear and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer
The page from which I been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces
I had to return be refunded the price of the first changer
I know Ill the changer and buy the one that matched the player
But by then the changer a few days later but lost the speakers
I received the real promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished
I think Amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss
In general Ive been happy with Belkin accessories but this cable is the pits
It lasted less than a month I used 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent
No crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within it to connect my HDDVR cable box to my receiver
I dont like to support the Monster Cable hype but because I can say that battery life is poor
After using these radios two months of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one
Perhaps my not true in a normal environment open sea or desert perhaps
10 mile range is batteries didnt come in good condition
After receiving this me the same error message DRUM NEAR END There was no indication when I purchased this product that it would be refurbished
Today 11507 my printer is giving DRUM which was listed as having a 25000 yield capacity on 121106
The transmitter works but it is of that it would be a good compromise we have IBM Dell and Toshiba laptops and a Sony Really Nice Monitor
I knew better but I did it anyway thinking low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do
No modem port not a runs on a delay of 12 seconds and is unacceptable
The mouse surprise but would have been nice the video display is well you can see stuff on the monitor
I switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected
I tried 3 of these DVDRs none of them worked errors in every burn
I used another brand to burn the session quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse
ive come to expect a decent level of and it worked perfectly so it is definately a problem with these DVDRs and not with my burner
the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface and i of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didnt test it well enough
i had to open the thing up and shave down part mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser wont track right
unless your willing to do that skip this one it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice
i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul
typical Shouldnt have bought a generic memory Serves me right Anyway
I purchased this product and couldnt get it to work on a PC laptop or pda cingular 8125
Not only does it not register could use the cable that came with iPOD one fewer thing to carry
I bought this Adapter because I in any SDMiniSD card reader but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well
Well about six months after had broken and the device was not working anymore
One of the contacts opening this item I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery
I am disappointed in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews
The principal benefit of this product is but should have expected that for the 10 I spent
I tried contacting the manufacturer losses and buy a different card
Ive decided to cut my and they never returned my phone call
Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wear and on a mousepad that isnt going to last them
I just couldnt suggest anyone else spent 15 mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface
I put this cover on immediately after I opened cover on it and have had it 3 weeks
Ive never had my iPod without the my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratch
I now Generation ipod If so this is not the product for you
Have a second have an iPod covered with distracting scratches on the screen
After buying my new green ipod I needed something to protect it so I bought the Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster
I tried but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off dont do this
I sugest making sure the product detail includes the second generation
Do not order this item if you want a DVD player with a 5 inch screen
You will receive less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam
We had this printer a small orange colored player with a 3
We would get an error message and then would have to reset the exchange program after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor
We finally ended up sending back the printer on their printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while
The tech support wanted us to install a under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam
The ink cartridge is pooling ink free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again
Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls which probably has something to do with the jamming problem
We still havent addressed the excessive ink leak the cartridge carrier back and forth and for now the unit is working
I hope have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position
I would like them to know I HP reviews comments on this website occasionally
Also HP several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible English
I talked to tech support is very difficult to deal with at best
I am one consumer willing cares when the end result is a very slow video
Easy setup but who to pay a little more for a product that is well supported
Sort of reminded me of the blur THATS what you see with this webcam Dont waste your money
When he whips his head from side to side and you see Jim Carey in the movie The Mask
This sucker couldnt pick up a single channel not even one less than 10 miles away
The case looks great and fits well but its nearly impossible to remove
I had to insert a of hurting both the case and the iPod
I was afraid credit card between the latches and pry for a long time
In addition its too wide in the could have just snapped the case off for docking
I might have considered keeping it if I case to dock in my Logitech speaker system
Although the 12 the price PLL digital 3 speaker DXLOC switch and
it is RS receiver doesnt have TV reception who cares
Bought it for my player for the gym and treats it somewhat rough
She uses her wife the pink just didnt match anything in my wardrobe
This case doesnt protect the screen from scratches see most case is there is no screen protection
The only drawback to this other reviews but it hasnt fallen off while shes worn it either
It is nice that it has a a clear window to protect the screen
Would be nice if it has clip and it fits the mp3 player snugly but
According to SysInternals Process Explorer both HWI hardware interrupts and 1 while using another manufacturers USBbased 802
Both remain under DPC deferred procedure calls tend to run to 340 each while this card is installed both drop to under 1 once its removed
Im given to understand that such high HWI and BTW gives better throughput than this bg card of DLinks
That other b adapter DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers but Ive found no useful driver update info on DLinks web site last I looked
Does not consistently work I have a toshiba a15 Win XP Pro and sometimes this works but usually it doesnt
Lately it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer
It used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found which forced me to reload the driver
But lately its just been giving me a blue screen
I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues
DLink needs to support their faulty product with a new driver Bad customer service
I bought this mouse while on the packaging otherwise I would have taken in back
I do not have the original road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse
The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the I cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons
If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time back I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card
The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scroll
The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver
I thought this was because I was using a I would not wish it on my enemy
Im going to throw this away since Mac I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well
It looked good but not being item works as expected but requires to be reset i
Overall this able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
The ends are but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website
We got the hdmi cables comming off this cable doesnt meet the normal Belkin standards
The cables come without any used the cables yet and were not sure whether they will work or not
We have not yet packaging and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website
Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C the battery discharges quickly and wont take a full charge
The next step was to do a hard reset of the Tungsten C and Im hoping it will take charge
It worked OK for told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37
When I complained I was 2 months but the KB kept on falling off
Yet it was I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working
The worse came when advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002
I contacted Targus and was told Windows XP but does not work well with Linux
Works fine on that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC
Ive been using Linux for at least 10100 NIC was much faster than this card would go
My built in 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux
Ended up getting and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box
Save yourself some headaches an Intel gigabit card that of course works with no issues
I just bought these non existent in comparison and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny
The Bass is to compare to my pair of V20s and they just suck in comparison
Any sort are compact but the sound is not good at all
These look nice and of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion
The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling
I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer
Since most new computers use USB for have an interface that is compatible with this product
My two newly purchased HP computers do not serial interface the usefulness of this unit is limited
The serial cable see it prior to opening the package
So you dont is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package
Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned
Lastly this is one of the worst packaging jobs I have seen
The plastic clamshell is so display is WAAaay too bright will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person and the user interface is terrible
Remote isnt very responsive and the hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors
The thing gets lousy reception and in general there is a reason why this is always the lower priced iPod type radio on websites
They are trying to get rid of it because it s_cks
I bought this because of the product name small size and variety of options
I bought it alarm clock today April 7 2007 at Bed Bath and Beyond for 10
Unfortunately I realized it wasnt a great buy when I brought it home
and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on
The connections appear the time in the dark but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry
Its supposed to help you see to be very sensitive and the battery doesnt stay in place
Actually the screen is blurry in a noisy environment this is not the clock for you
If youre a sound sleeper or live in most positions even with the light off
Youll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear
A final note on this product The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems
If I close the cover all the way the clock shuts off
If you want an alarm clock that will last awhile I suggest buying something else
I wanted to from the manual was followed the printer did not work
Even though instructions convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer
The customer support is claimed naturally expect better customer service and better response time
So customers can to be 247 but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet
I tried several times to contact Sandisk by XP and the light goes out the system cant ID the device so its useless
My wifes Cruzer just failed as well the power light comes on it is recognized including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response
It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our house
Ive tried front side USB connections rear connections and hub connections
And I was going to order another 100 for the office
THANKS AMAZON BUT THE PHOTO DOESNT GIVE IT ANY CREDIT
THESE DONT COME WITH A BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS NOW THEY WILL PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO
I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose
A friend with the same device suggested checking of three remarkably similar devices all had the same description and specs
Since then it it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution
When it worked has come loose twice more so I just dont use it anymore
I just purchased this item to store liner notes just doesnt work properly
One of the advertised features the ability now Im planning to return it tomorrow
They just dont into the pocket without bending andor forcing them in
To me the liner notes have value and Im not willing to fold spindle or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
As soon as I received flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio
The base felt this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up
I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right
I cannot comment on the reception as the antenna is broken
Overall its a nice loud grinding noises when started or while printing
Machine started making looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials
Showed it after one year so have to bear the expense
Died just to a repair shop says the fuser is a toast
Beware i searched the until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that couldnt be fixed by the sales technician
our MFC 8840DN worked fine web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem
Lots of waiting for Brother or Amazon again as a result of this
Will never buy from a response from Brother at their call in website
The buttons dont have that hard to read icons take a little figuring out
The labels are clicky button feel so you press and youre like did it go
Honestly I use it for complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod Video
My first and main turning onoff and if I want to do anything else I go up to the iHome to adjust it
The 60gb model is thicker sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks there is no protection for the screen
A secondary complaint is that though the case is than the 30gb and this case wont close around the 60gb iPod
Its just a hole in the case like the hole for using the wheel and I just require more protection for my video iPod
A third minor complaint is that theres a nonremovable knob on the back of the case for attaching the belt clip and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket
Im returning mine for all of these reasons and going I generally get a signal when outdoors
I live in Washington DC so with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen too
Using these get decent reception I tried them in my office in NYC which has a northern exposure and it got good reception
Now the good news they do headphones did not yield an increased signal for me
I too experienced the Blue Screen of Death on my laptop which has XP pro on it
I had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting
On another note the install Tech support group and had to return everything
I didnt get anywhere with the of the router was GREAT regardless
After printing just a few pictures the for a few photos and then the color turns funny again
Put in a new cartridge and it will work color on the photo turns to pink and yellow
Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image but of garbage since the day I bought it
This printer has been a piece it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos
I dont know why I long ago and I would have cut my losses instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink
It should have been thrown it in the trash kept trying as the purchase was made about a year ago
I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message turning the printer off turning it back on doing that several times and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day
Now it says the cartridge should be replaced when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge
The ironic thing is print one more picture were a waste of about two hours
But several tries to the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful
This is the last time a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer my motherinlaws
com brought it home and printed I try to use the printer it is finally going in the trash
The resulting photograp the various enhancement controls within the printer the green tint remained
I then adjusted was horrible it had a very green tint to it
I checked the troubleshooting product is still on the market I suspect I had a broken unit
Given that the section of the manual checkedcleaned the print heads and still the problem remained
I have only had all three sets 4 per set three times each
I have recharged the batteries for a short time but they are working great
thats what of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours
I take a lot taks to run my Canon PowerShotS2I2 cameraall good news
But I know that I need another 3 sets packing and long walks on the beaches
I do alot of back to really keep me in the field for the day
These batteries are really good they have never let me ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv
it says its an AV dock for video down as of yet thats why I will be getting more
what a the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the av inputs of my tv
they sinply plug into waste AV cables that sell for 20 are incredible
I was very disappointed you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper
Cables that when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables
The Airport Express itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and go to your local i brought and never work its useles
I dont like this mouse Radio Shack for the miniRCA cable and a quick search online for the optical to mini
Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product Ive ever used
I was stupid and used it on my primary display first instead of using the 5050 isopropyl alcoholwater mix thats far superior to klear screen products
My LCD now has nearly perfect because I only used the 5050 solution on it my 2001fp looks horrible now
My 3 year old laptops display looks cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out
I am using two look like the picture which looks more like the 425 model
This one does not other PhilipsMagnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better
It does not cover the equipment I have while the 425 model does Its learning mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least
Conclusion This would make for a nice ornament It does look nice and if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices
I bought this product to replace a previous HP allinone printer I had
This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned
It does not like photo to vendor by shipper as damaged in shipment
merchandise returned paper it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced
